"x35"," Introduction"
"x35",""
"x35",""
"x35","The Time Traveller (for so it will be convenient to speak of him) was"
"x35","expounding a recondite matter to us. His pale grey eyes shone and"
"x35","twinkled, and his usually pale face was flushed and animated. The fire"
"x35","burnt brightly, and the soft radiance of the incandescent lights in the"
"x35","lilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and passed in our"
"x35","glasses. Our chairs, being his patents, embraced and caressed us rather"
"x35","than submitted to be sat upon, and there was that luxurious"
"x35","after-dinner atmosphere, when thought runs gracefully free of the"
"x35","trammels of precision. And he put it to us in this way—marking the"
"x35","points with a lean forefinger—as we sat and lazily admired his"
"x35","earnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it) and his fecundity."
"x35",""
"x35","“You must follow me carefully. I shall have to controvert one or two"
"x35","ideas that are almost universally accepted. The geometry, for instance,"
"x35","they taught you at school is founded on a misconception.”"
"x35",""
"x35","“Is not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon?” said"
"x35","Filby, an argumentative person with red hair."
"x35",""
"x35","“I do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable ground"
"x35","for it. You will soon admit as much as I need from you. You know of"
"x35","course that a mathematical line, a line of thickness _nil_, has no real"
"x35","existence. They taught you that? Neither has a mathematical plane."
"x35","These things are mere abstractions.”"
"x35",""
"x35","“That is all right,” said the Psychologist."
"x35",""
"x35","“Nor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have a"
"x35","real existence.”"
"x35",""
"x35","“There I object,” said Filby. “Of course a solid body may exist. All"
"x35","real things—”"
"x35",""
"x35","“So most people think. But wait a moment. Can an _instantaneous_ cube"
"x35","exist?”"
"x35",""
"x35","“Don’t follow you,” said Filby."
"x35",""
"x35","“Can a cube that does not last for any time at all, have a real"
"x35","existence?”"
"x35",""
"x35","Filby became pensive. “Clearly,” the Time Traveller proceeded, “any"
"x35","real body must have extension in _four_ directions: it must have"
"x35","Length, Breadth, Thickness, and—Duration. But through a natural"
"x35","infirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you in a moment, we"
"x35","incline to overlook this fact. There are really four dimensions, three"
"x35","which we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time. There is,"
"x35","however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between the former"
"x35","three dimensions and the latter, because it happens that our"
"x35","consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the latter"
"x35","from the beginning to the end of our lives.”"
"x35",""
"x35","“That,” said a very young man, making spasmodic efforts to relight his"
"x35","cigar over the lamp; “that . . . very clear indeed.”"
"x35",""
"x35","“Now, it is very remarkable that this is so extensively overlooked,”"
"x35","continued the Time Traveller, with a slight accession of cheerfulness."
"x35","“Really this is what is meant by the Fourth Dimension, though some"
"x35","people who talk about the Fourth Dimension do not know they mean it. It"
"x35","is only another way of looking at Time. _There is no difference between"
"x35","Time and any of the three dimensions of Space except that our"
"x35","consciousness moves along it_. But some foolish people have got hold of"
"x35","the wrong side of that idea. You have all heard what they have to say"
"x35","about this Fourth Dimension?”"
"x35",""
"x35","“_I_ have not,” said the Provincial Mayor."
"x35",""
"x35","“It is simply this. That Space, as our mathematicians have it, is"
"x35","spoken of as having three dimensions, which one may call Length,"
"x35","Breadth, and Thickness, and is always definable by reference to three"
"x35","planes, each at right angles to the others. But some philosophical"
"x35","people have been asking why _three_ dimensions particularly—why not"
"x35","another direction at right angles to the other three?—and have even"
"x35","tried to construct a Four-Dimensional geometry. Professor Simon Newcomb"
"x35","was expounding this to the New York Mathematical Society only a month"
"x35","or so ago. You know how on a flat surface, which has only two"
"x35","dimensions, we can represent a figure of a three-dimensional solid, and"
"x35","similarly they think that by models of three dimensions they could"
"x35","represent one of four—if they could master the perspective of the"
"x35","thing. See?”"
"x35",""
"x35","“I think so,” murmured the Provincial Mayor; and, knitting his brows,"
"x35","he lapsed into an introspective state, his lips moving as one who"
"x35","repeats mystic words. “Yes, I think I see it now,” he said after some"
"x35","time, brightening in a quite transitory manner."
"x35",""
"x35","“Well, I do not mind telling you I have been at work upon this geometry"
"x35","of Four Dimensions for some time. Some of my results are curious. For"
"x35","instance, here is a portrait of a man at eight years old, another at"
"x35","fifteen, another at seventeen, another at twenty-three, and so on. All"
"x35","these are evidently sections, as it were, Three-Dimensional"
"x35","representations of his Four-Dimensioned being, which is a fixed and"
"x35","unalterable thing."
"x35",""
"x35","“Scientific people,” proceeded the Time Traveller, after the pause"
"x35","required for the proper assimilation of this, “know very well that Time"
"x35","is only a kind of Space. Here is a popular scientific diagram, a"
"x35","weather record. This line I trace with my finger shows the movement of"
"x35","the barometer. Yesterday it was so high, yesterday night it fell, then"
"x35","this morning it rose again, and so gently upward to here. Surely the"
"x35","mercury did not trace this line in any of the dimensions of Space"
"x35","generally recognised? But certainly it traced such a line, and that"
"x35","line, therefore, we must conclude, was along the Time-Dimension.”"
"x35",""
"x35","“But,” said the Medical Man, staring hard at a coal in the fire, “if"
"x35","Time is really only a fourth dimension of Space, why is it, and why has"
"x35","it always been, regarded as something different? And why cannot we move"
"x35","in Time as we move about in the other dimensions of Space?”"
"x35",""
"x35","The Time Traveller smiled. “Are you so sure we can move freely in"
"x35","Space? Right and left we can go, backward and forward freely enough,"
"x35","and men always have done so. I admit we move freely in two dimensions."
"x35","But how about up and down? Gravitation limits us there.”"
"x35",""
"x35","“Not exactly,” said the Medical Man. “There are balloons.”"
"x35",""
"x35","“But before the balloons, save for spasmodic jumping and the"
"x35","inequalities of the surface, man had no freedom of vertical movement.”"
"x35",""
"x35","“Still they could move a little up and down,” said the Medical Man."
"x35",""
"x35","“Easier, far easier down than up.”"
"x35",""
"x35","“And you cannot move at all in Time, you cannot get away from the"
"x35","present moment.”"
"x35",""
"x35","“My dear sir, that is just where you are wrong. That is just where the"
"x35","whole world has gone wrong. We are always getting away from the present"
"x35","moment. Our mental existences, which are immaterial and have no"
"x35","dimensions, are passing along the Time-Dimension with a uniform"
"x35","velocity from the cradle to the grave. Just as we should travel _down_"
"x35","if we began our existence fifty miles above the earth’s surface.”"
"x35",""
"x35","“But the great difficulty is this,” interrupted the Psychologist. ’You"
"x35","_can_ move about in all directions of Space, but you cannot move about"
"x35","in Time.”"
"x35",""
"x35","“That is the germ of my great discovery. But you are wrong to say that"
"x35","we cannot move about in Time. For instance, if I am recalling an"
"x35","incident very vividly I go back to the instant of its occurrence: I"
"x35","become absent-minded, as you say. I jump back for a moment. Of course"
"x35","we have no means of staying back for any length of Time, any more than"
"x35","a savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the ground. But a"
"x35","civilised man is better off than the savage in this respect. He can go"
"x35","up against gravitation in a balloon, and why should he not hope that"
"x35","ultimately he may be able to stop or accelerate his drift along the"
"x35","Time-Dimension, or even turn about and travel the other way?”"
"x35",""
"x35","“Oh, _this_,” began Filby, “is all—”"
"x35",""
"x35","“Why not?” said the Time Traveller."
"x35",""
"x35","“It’s against reason,” said Filby."
"x35",""
"x35","“What reason?” said the Time Traveller."
"x35",""
"x35","“You can show black is white by argument,” said Filby, “but you will"
"x35","never convince me.”"
"x35",""
"x35","“Possibly not,” said the Time Traveller. “But now you begin to see the"
"x35","object of my investigations into the geometry of Four Dimensions. Long"
"x35","ago I had a vague inkling of a machine—”"
"x35",""
"x35","“To travel through Time!” exclaimed the Very Young Man."
"x35",""
"x35","“That shall travel indifferently in any direction of Space and Time, as"
"x35","the driver determines.”"
"x35",""
"x35","Filby contented himself with laughter."
"x35",""
"x35","“But I have experimental verification,” said the Time Traveller."
"x35",""
"x35","“It would be remarkably convenient for the historian,” the Psychologist"
"x35","suggested. “One might travel back and verify the accepted account of"
"x35","the Battle of Hastings, for instance!”"
"x35",""
"x35","“Don’t you think you would attract attention?” said the Medical Man."
"x35","“Our ancestors had no great tolerance for anachronisms.”"
"x35",""
"x35","“One might get one’s Greek from the very lips of Homer and Plato,” the"
"x35","Very Young Man thought."
"x35",""
"x35","“In which case they would certainly plough you for the Little-go. The"
"x35","German scholars have improved Greek so much.”"
"x35",""
"x35","“Then there is the future,” said the Very Young Man. “Just think! One"
"x35","might invest all one’s money, leave it to accumulate at interest, and"
"x35","hurry on ahead!”"
"x35",""
"x35","“To discover a society,” said I, “erected on a strictly communistic"
"x35","basis.”"
"x35",""
"x35","“Of all the wild extravagant theories!” began the Psychologist."
"x35",""
"x35","“Yes, so it seemed to me, and so I never talked of it until—”"
"x35",""
"x35","“Experimental verification!” cried I. “You are going to verify _that_?”"
"x35",""
"x35","“The experiment!” cried Filby, who was getting brain-weary."
"x35",""
"x35","“Let’s see your experiment anyhow,” said the Psychologist, “though it’s"
"x35","all humbug, you know.”"
"x35",""
"x35","The Time Traveller smiled round at us. Then, still smiling faintly, and"
"x35","with his hands deep in his trousers pockets, he walked slowly out of"
"x35","the room, and we heard his slippers shuffling down the long passage to"
"x35","his laboratory."
"x35",""
"x35","The Psychologist looked at us. “I wonder what he’s got?”"
"x35",""
"x35","“Some sleight-of-hand trick or other,” said the Medical Man, and Filby"
"x35","tried to tell us about a conjuror he had seen at Burslem, but before he"
"x35","had finished his preface the Time Traveller came back, and Filby’s"
"x35","anecdote collapsed."

"x35"," II."
"x35"," The Machine"
"x35",""
"x35",""
"x35","The thing the Time Traveller held in his hand was a glittering metallic"
"x35","framework, scarcely larger than a small clock, and very delicately"
"x35","made. There was ivory in it, and some transparent crystalline"
"x35","substance. And now I must be explicit, for this that follows—unless his"
"x35","explanation is to be accepted—is an absolutely unaccountable thing. He"
"x35","took one of the small octagonal tables that were scattered about the"
"x35","room, and set it in front of the fire, with two legs on the hearthrug."
"x35","On this table he placed the mechanism. Then he drew up a chair, and sat"
"x35","down. The only other object on the table was a small shaded lamp, the"
"x35","bright light of which fell upon the model. There were also perhaps a"
"x35","dozen candles about, two in brass candlesticks upon the mantel and"
"x35","several in sconces, so that the room was brilliantly illuminated. I sat"
"x35","in a low arm-chair nearest the fire, and I drew this forward so as to"
"x35","be almost between the Time Traveller and the fireplace. Filby sat"
"x35","behind him, looking over his shoulder. The Medical Man and the"
"x35","Provincial Mayor watched him in profile from the right, the"
"x35","Psychologist from the left. The Very Young Man stood behind the"
"x35","Psychologist. We were all on the alert. It appears incredible to me"
"x35","that any kind of trick, however subtly conceived and however adroitly"
"x35","done, could have been played upon us under these conditions."
"x35",""
"x35","The Time Traveller looked at us, and then at the mechanism. “Well?”"
"x35","said the Psychologist."
"x35",""
"x35","“This little affair,” said the Time Traveller, resting his elbows upon"
"x35","the table and pressing his hands together above the apparatus, “is only"
"x35","a model. It is my plan for a machine to travel through time. You will"
"x35","notice that it looks singularly askew, and that there is an odd"
"x35","twinkling appearance about this bar, as though it was in some way"
"x35","unreal.” He pointed to the part with his finger. “Also, here is one"
"x35","little white lever, and here is another.”"
"x35",""
"x35","The Medical Man got up out of his chair and peered into the thing."
"x35","“It’s beautifully made,” he said."
"x35",""
"x35","“It took two years to make,” retorted the Time Traveller. Then, when we"
"x35","had all imitated the action of the Medical Man, he said: “Now I want"
"x35","you clearly to understand that this lever, being pressed over, sends"
"x35","the machine gliding into the future, and this other reverses the"
"x35","motion. This saddle represents the seat of a time traveller. Presently"
"x35","I am going to press the lever, and off the machine will go. It will"
"x35","vanish, pass into future Time, and disappear. Have a good look at the"
"x35","thing. Look at the table too, and satisfy yourselves there is no"
"x35","trickery. I don’t want to waste this model, and then be told I’m a"
"x35","quack.”"
"x35",""
"x35","There was a minute’s pause perhaps. The Psychologist seemed about to"
"x35","speak to me, but changed his mind. Then the Time Traveller put forth"
"x35","his finger towards the lever. “No,” he said suddenly. “Lend me your"
"x35","hand.” And turning to the Psychologist, he took that individual’s hand"
"x35","in his own and told him to put out his forefinger. So that it was the"
"x35","Psychologist himself who sent forth the model Time Machine on its"
"x35","interminable voyage. We all saw the lever turn. I am absolutely certain"
"x35","there was no trickery. There was a breath of wind, and the lamp flame"
"x35","jumped. One of the candles on the mantel was blown out, and the little"
"x35","machine suddenly swung round, became indistinct, was seen as a ghost"
"x35","for a second perhaps, as an eddy of faintly glittering brass and ivory;"
"x35","and it was gone—vanished! Save for the lamp the table was bare."
"x35",""
"x35","Everyone was silent for a minute. Then Filby said he was damned."
"x35",""
"x35","The Psychologist recovered from his stupor, and suddenly looked under"
"x35","the table. At that the Time Traveller laughed cheerfully. “Well?” he"
"x35","said, with a reminiscence of the Psychologist. Then, getting up, he"
"x35","went to the tobacco jar on the mantel, and with his back to us began to"
"x35","fill his pipe."
"x35",""
"x35","We stared at each other. “Look here,” said the Medical Man, “are you in"
"x35","earnest about this? Do you seriously believe that that machine has"
"x35","travelled into time?”"
"x35",""
"x35","“Certainly,” said the Time Traveller, stooping to light a spill at the"
"x35","fire. Then he turned, lighting his pipe, to look at the Psychologist’s"
"x35","face. (The Psychologist, to show that he was not unhinged, helped"
"x35","himself to a cigar and tried to light it uncut.) “What is more, I have"
"x35","a big machine nearly finished in there”—he indicated the"
"x35","laboratory—“and when that is put together I mean to have a journey on"
"x35","my own account.”"
"x35",""
"x35","“You mean to say that that machine has travelled into the future?” said"
"x35","Filby."
"x35",""
"x35","“Into the future or the past—I don’t, for certain, know which.”"
"x35",""
"x35","After an interval the Psychologist had an inspiration. “It must have"
"x35","gone into the past if it has gone anywhere,” he said."
"x35",""
"x35","“Why?” said the Time Traveller."
"x35",""
"x35","“Because I presume that it has not moved in space, and if it travelled"
"x35","into the future it would still be here all this time, since it must"
"x35","have travelled through this time.”"
"x35",""
"x35","“But,” said I, “If it travelled into the past it would have been"
"x35","visible when we came first into this room; and last Thursday when we"
"x35","were here; and the Thursday before that; and so forth!”"
"x35",""
"x35","“Serious objections,” remarked the Provincial Mayor, with an air of"
"x35","impartiality, turning towards the Time Traveller."
"x35",""
"x35","“Not a bit,” said the Time Traveller, and, to the Psychologist: “You"
"x35","think. _You_ can explain that. It’s presentation below the threshold,"
"x35","you know, diluted presentation.”"
"x35",""
"x35","“Of course,” said the Psychologist, and reassured us. “That’s a simple"
"x35","point of psychology. I should have thought of it. It’s plain enough,"
"x35","and helps the paradox delightfully. We cannot see it, nor can we"
"x35","appreciate this machine, any more than we can the spoke of a wheel"
"x35","spinning, or a bullet flying through the air. If it is travelling"
"x35","through time fifty times or a hundred times faster than we are, if it"
"x35","gets through a minute while we get through a second, the impression it"
"x35","creates will of course be only one-fiftieth or one-hundredth of what it"
"x35","would make if it were not travelling in time. That’s plain enough.” He"
"x35","passed his hand through the space in which the machine had been. “You"
"x35","see?” he said, laughing."
"x35",""
"x35","We sat and stared at the vacant table for a minute or so. Then the Time"
"x35","Traveller asked us what we thought of it all."
"x35",""
"x35","“It sounds plausible enough tonight,” said the Medical Man; “but wait"
"x35","until tomorrow. Wait for the common sense of the morning.”"
"x35",""
"x35","“Would you like to see the Time Machine itself?” asked the Time"
"x35","Traveller. And therewith, taking the lamp in his hand, he led the way"
"x35","down the long, draughty corridor to his laboratory. I remember vividly"
"x35","the flickering light, his queer, broad head in silhouette, the dance of"
"x35","the shadows, how we all followed him, puzzled but incredulous, and how"
"x35","there in the laboratory we beheld a larger edition of the little"
"x35","mechanism which we had seen vanish from before our eyes. Parts were of"
"x35","nickel, parts of ivory, parts had certainly been filed or sawn out of"
"x35","rock crystal. The thing was generally complete, but the twisted"
"x35","crystalline bars lay unfinished upon the bench beside some sheets of"
"x35","drawings, and I took one up for a better look at it. Quartz it seemed"
"x35","to be."
"x35",""
"x35","“Look here,” said the Medical Man, “are you perfectly serious? Or is"
"x35","this a trick—like that ghost you showed us last Christmas?”"
"x35",""
"x35","“Upon that machine,” said the Time Traveller, holding the lamp aloft,"
"x35","“I intend to explore time. Is that plain? I was never more serious in"
"x35","my life.”"
"x35",""
"x35","None of us quite knew how to take it."
"x35",""
"x35","I caught Filby’s eye over the shoulder of the Medical Man, and he"
"x35","winked at me solemnly."
"x35",""
"x35",""
"x35",""
"x35",""
"x35"," III."
"x35"," The Time Traveller Returns"
"x35",""
"x35",""
"x35","I think that at that time none of us quite believed in the Time"
"x35","Machine. The fact is, the Time Traveller was one of those men who are"
"x35","too clever to be believed: you never felt that you saw all round him;"
"x35","you always suspected some subtle reserve, some ingenuity in ambush,"
"x35","behind his lucid frankness. Had Filby shown the model and explained the"
"x35","matter in the Time Traveller’s words, we should have shown _him_ far"
"x35","less scepticism. For we should have perceived his motives: a"
"x35","pork-butcher could understand Filby. But the Time Traveller had more"
"x35","than a touch of whim among his elements, and we distrusted him. Things"
"x35","that would have made the fame of a less clever man seemed tricks in his"
"x35","hands. It is a mistake to do things too easily. The serious people who"
"x35","took him seriously never felt quite sure of his deportment; they were"
"x35","somehow aware that trusting their reputations for judgment with him was"
"x35","like furnishing a nursery with eggshell china. So I don’t think any of"
"x35","us said very much about time travelling in the interval between that"
"x35","Thursday and the next, though its odd potentialities ran, no doubt, in"
"x35","most of our minds: its plausibility, that is, its practical"
"x35","incredibleness, the curious possibilities of anachronism and of utter"
"x35","confusion it suggested. For my own part, I was particularly preoccupied"
"x35","with the trick of the model. That I remember discussing with the"
"x35","Medical Man, whom I met on Friday at the Linnæan. He said he had seen a"
"x35","similar thing at Tübingen, and laid considerable stress on the"
"x35","blowing-out of the candle. But how the trick was done he could not"
"x35","explain."
"x35",""
"x35","The next Thursday I went again to Richmond—I suppose I was one of the"
"x35","Time Traveller’s most constant guests—and, arriving late, found four or"
"x35","five men already assembled in his drawing-room. The Medical Man was"
"x35","standing before the fire with a sheet of paper in one hand and his"
"x35","watch in the other. I looked round for the Time Traveller, and—“It’s"
"x35","half-past seven now,” said the Medical Man. “I suppose we’d better have"
"x35","dinner?”"
"x35",""
"x35","“Where’s——?” said I, naming our host."
"x35",""
"x35","“You’ve just come? It’s rather odd. He’s unavoidably detained. He asks"
"x35","me in this note to lead off with dinner at seven if he’s not back. Says"
"x35","he’ll explain when he comes.”"
"x35",""
"x35","“It seems a pity to let the dinner spoil,” said the Editor of a"
"x35","well-known daily paper; and thereupon the Doctor rang the bell."
"x35",""
"x35","The Psychologist was the only person besides the Doctor and myself who"
"x35","had attended the previous dinner. The other men were Blank, the Editor"
"x35","aforementioned, a certain journalist, and another—a quiet, shy man with"
"x35","a beard—whom I didn’t know, and who, as far as my observation went,"
"x35","never opened his mouth all the evening. There was some speculation at"
"x35","the dinner-table about the Time Traveller’s absence, and I suggested"
"x35","time travelling, in a half-jocular spirit. The Editor wanted that"
"x35","explained to him, and the Psychologist volunteered a wooden account of"
"x35","the “ingenious paradox and trick” we had witnessed that day week. He"
"x35","was in the midst of his exposition when the door from the corridor"
"x35","opened slowly and without noise. I was facing the door, and saw it"
"x35","first. “Hallo!” I said. “At last!” And the door opened wider, and the"
"x35","Time Traveller stood before us. I gave a cry of surprise. “Good"
"x35","heavens! man, what’s the matter?” cried the Medical Man, who saw him"
"x35","next. And the whole tableful turned towards the door."
"x35",""
"x35","He was in an amazing plight. His coat was dusty and dirty, and smeared"
"x35","with green down the sleeves; his hair disordered, and as it seemed to"
"x35","me greyer—either with dust and dirt or because its colour had actually"
"x35","faded. His face was ghastly pale; his chin had a brown cut on it—a cut"
"x35","half-healed; his expression was haggard and drawn, as by intense"
"x35","suffering. For a moment he hesitated in the doorway, as if he had been"
"x35","dazzled by the light. Then he came into the room. He walked with just"
"x35","such a limp as I have seen in footsore tramps. We stared at him in"
"x35","silence, expecting him to speak."
"x35",""
"x35","He said not a word, but came painfully to the table, and made a motion"
"x35","towards the wine. The Editor filled a glass of champagne, and pushed it"
"x35","towards him. He drained it, and it seemed to do him good: for he looked"
"x35","round the table, and the ghost of his old smile flickered across his"
"x35","face. “What on earth have you been up to, man?” said the Doctor. The"
"x35","Time Traveller did not seem to hear. “Don’t let me disturb you,” he"
"x35","said, with a certain faltering articulation. “I’m all right.” He"
"x35","stopped, held out his glass for more, and took it off at a draught."
"x35","“That’s good,” he said. His eyes grew brighter, and a faint colour came"
"x35","into his cheeks. His glance flickered over our faces with a certain"
"x35","dull approval, and then went round the warm and comfortable room. Then"
"x35","he spoke again, still as it were feeling his way among his words. “I’m"
"x35","going to wash and dress, and then I’ll come down and explain things...."
"x35","Save me some of that mutton. I’m starving for a bit of meat.”"
"x35",""
"x35","He looked across at the Editor, who was a rare visitor, and hoped he"
"x35","was all right. The Editor began a question. “Tell you presently,” said"
"x35","the Time Traveller. “I’m—funny! Be all right in a minute.”"
"x35",""
"x35","He put down his glass, and walked towards the staircase door. Again I"
"x35","remarked his lameness and the soft padding sound of his footfall, and"
"x35","standing up in my place, I saw his feet as he went out. He had nothing"
"x35","on them but a pair of tattered, blood-stained socks. Then the door"
"x35","closed upon him. I had half a mind to follow, till I remembered how he"
"x35","detested any fuss about himself. For a minute, perhaps, my mind was"
"x35","wool-gathering. Then, “Remarkable Behaviour of an Eminent Scientist,” I"
"x35","heard the Editor say, thinking (after his wont) in headlines. And this"
"x35","brought my attention back to the bright dinner-table."
"x35",""
"x35","“What’s the game?” said the Journalist. “Has he been doing the Amateur"
"x35","Cadger? I don’t follow.” I met the eye of the Psychologist, and read my"
"x35","own interpretation in his face. I thought of the Time Traveller limping"
"x35","painfully upstairs. I don’t think anyone else had noticed his lameness."
"x35",""
"x35","The first to recover completely from this surprise was the Medical Man,"
"x35","who rang the bell—the Time Traveller hated to have servants waiting at"
"x35","dinner—for a hot plate. At that the Editor turned to his knife and fork"
"x35","with a grunt, and the Silent Man followed suit. The dinner was resumed."
"x35","Conversation was exclamatory for a little while with gaps of"
"x35","wonderment; and then the Editor got fervent in his curiosity. “Does our"
"x35","friend eke out his modest income with a crossing? or has he his"
"x35","Nebuchadnezzar phases?” he inquired. “I feel assured it’s this business"
"x35","of the Time Machine,” I said, and took up the Psychologist’s account of"
"x35","our previous meeting. The new guests were frankly incredulous. The"
"x35","Editor raised objections. “What _was_ this time travelling? A man"
"x35","couldn’t cover himself with dust by rolling in a paradox, could he?”"
"x35","And then, as the idea came home to him, he resorted to caricature."
"x35","Hadn’t they any clothes-brushes in the Future? The Journalist too,"
"x35","would not believe at any price, and joined the Editor in the easy work"
"x35","of heaping ridicule on the whole thing. They were both the new kind of"
"x35","journalist—very joyous, irreverent young men. “Our Special"
"x35","Correspondent in the Day after Tomorrow reports,” the Journalist was"
"x35","saying—or rather shouting—when the Time Traveller came back. He was"
"x35","dressed in ordinary evening clothes, and nothing save his haggard look"
"x35","remained of the change that had startled me."
"x35",""
"x35","“I say,” said the Editor hilariously, “these chaps here say you have"
"x35","been travelling into the middle of next week! Tell us all about little"
"x35","Rosebery, will you? What will you take for the lot?”"
"x35",""
"x35","The Time Traveller came to the place reserved for him without a word."
"x35","He smiled quietly, in his old way. “Where’s my mutton?” he said. “What"
"x35","a treat it is to stick a fork into meat again!”"
"x35",""
"x35","“Story!” cried the Editor."
"x35",""
"x35","“Story be damned!” said the Time Traveller. “I want something to eat. I"
"x35","won’t say a word until I get some peptone into my arteries. Thanks. And"
"x35","the salt.”"
"x35",""
"x35","“One word,” said I. “Have you been time travelling?”"
"x35",""
"x35","“Yes,” said the Time Traveller, with his mouth full, nodding his head."
"x35",""
"x35","“I’d give a shilling a line for a verbatim note,” said the Editor. The"
"x35","Time Traveller pushed his glass towards the Silent Man and rang it with"
"x35","his fingernail; at which the Silent Man, who had been staring at his"
"x35","face, started convulsively, and poured him wine. The rest of the dinner"
"x35","was uncomfortable. For my own part, sudden questions kept on rising to"
"x35","my lips, and I dare say it was the same with the others. The Journalist"
"x35","tried to relieve the tension by telling anecdotes of Hettie Potter. The"
"x35","Time Traveller devoted his attention to his dinner, and displayed the"
"x35","appetite of a tramp. The Medical Man smoked a cigarette, and watched"
"x35","the Time Traveller through his eyelashes. The Silent Man seemed even"
"x35","more clumsy than usual, and drank champagne with regularity and"
"x35","determination out of sheer nervousness. At last the Time Traveller"
"x35","pushed his plate away, and looked round us. “I suppose I must"
"x35","apologise,” he said. “I was simply starving. I’ve had a most amazing"
"x35","time.” He reached out his hand for a cigar, and cut the end. “But come"
"x35","into the smoking-room. It’s too long a story to tell over greasy"
"x35","plates.” And ringing the bell in passing, he led the way into the"
"x35","adjoining room."
"x35",""
"x35","“You have told Blank, and Dash, and Chose about the machine?” he said"
"x35","to me, leaning back in his easy-chair and naming the three new guests."
"x35",""
"x35","“But the thing’s a mere paradox,” said the Editor."
"x35",""
"x35","“I can’t argue tonight. I don’t mind telling you the story, but I can’t"
"x35","argue. I will,” he went on, “tell you the story of what has happened to"
"x35","me, if you like, but you must refrain from interruptions. I want to"
"x35","tell it. Badly. Most of it will sound like lying. So be it! It’s"
"x35","true—every word of it, all the same. I was in my laboratory at four"
"x35","o’clock, and since then … I’ve lived eight days … such days as no human"
"x35","being ever lived before! I’m nearly worn out, but I shan’t sleep till"
"x35","I’ve told this thing over to you. Then I shall go to bed. But no"
"x35","interruptions! Is it agreed?”"
"x35",""
"x35","“Agreed,” said the Editor, and the rest of us echoed “Agreed.” And with"
"x35","that the Time Traveller began his story as I have set it forth. He sat"
"x35","back in his chair at first, and spoke like a weary man. Afterwards he"
"x35","got more animated. In writing it down I feel with only too much"
"x35","keenness the inadequacy of pen and ink—and, above all, my own"
"x35","inadequacy—to express its quality. You read, I will suppose,"
"x35","attentively enough; but you cannot see the speaker’s white, sincere"
"x35","face in the bright circle of the little lamp, nor hear the intonation"
"x35","of his voice. You cannot know how his expression followed the turns of"
"x35","his story! Most of us hearers were in shadow, for the candles in the"
"x35","smoking-room had not been lighted, and only the face of the Journalist"
"x35","and the legs of the Silent Man from the knees downward were"
"x35","illuminated. At first we glanced now and again at each other. After a"
"x35","time we ceased to do that, and looked only at the Time Traveller’s"
"x35","face."

"x35"," Time Travelling"
"x35",""
"x35",""
"x35","“I told some of you last Thursday of the principles of the Time"
"x35","Machine, and showed you the actual thing itself, incomplete in the"
"x35","workshop. There it is now, a little travel-worn, truly; and one of the"
"x35","ivory bars is cracked, and a brass rail bent; but the rest of it’s"
"x35","sound enough. I expected to finish it on Friday; but on Friday, when"
"x35","the putting together was nearly done, I found that one of the nickel"
"x35","bars was exactly one inch too short, and this I had to get remade; so"
"x35","that the thing was not complete until this morning. It was at ten"
"x35","o’clock today that the first of all Time Machines began its career. I"
"x35","gave it a last tap, tried all the screws again, put one more drop of"
"x35","oil on the quartz rod, and sat myself in the saddle. I suppose a"
"x35","suicide who holds a pistol to his skull feels much the same wonder at"
"x35","what will come next as I felt then. I took the starting lever in one"
"x35","hand and the stopping one in the other, pressed the first, and almost"
"x35","immediately the second. I seemed to reel; I felt a nightmare sensation"
"x35","of falling; and, looking round, I saw the laboratory exactly as before."
"x35","Had anything happened? For a moment I suspected that my intellect had"
"x35","tricked me. Then I noted the clock. A moment before, as it seemed, it"
"x35","had stood at a minute or so past ten; now it was nearly half-past"
"x35","three!"
"x35",""
"x35","“I drew a breath, set my teeth, gripped the starting lever with both"
"x35","hands, and went off with a thud. The laboratory got hazy and went dark."
"x35","Mrs. Watchett came in and walked, apparently without seeing me, towards"
"x35","the garden door. I suppose it took her a minute or so to traverse the"
"x35","place, but to me she seemed to shoot across the room like a rocket. I"
"x35","pressed the lever over to its extreme position. The night came like the"
"x35","turning out of a lamp, and in another moment came tomorrow. The"
"x35","laboratory grew faint and hazy, then fainter and ever fainter. Tomorrow"
"x35","night came black, then day again, night again, day again, faster and"
"x35","faster still. An eddying murmur filled my ears, and a strange, dumb"
"x35","confusedness descended on my mind."
"x35",""
"x35","“I am afraid I cannot convey the peculiar sensations of time"
"x35","travelling. They are excessively unpleasant. There is a feeling exactly"
"x35","like that one has upon a switchback—of a helpless headlong motion! I"
"x35","felt the same horrible anticipation, too, of an imminent smash. As I"
"x35","put on pace, night followed day like the flapping of a black wing. The"
"x35","dim suggestion of the laboratory seemed presently to fall away from me,"
"x35","and I saw the sun hopping swiftly across the sky, leaping it every"
"x35","minute, and every minute marking a day. I supposed the laboratory had"
"x35","been destroyed and I had come into the open air. I had a dim impression"
"x35","of scaffolding, but I was already going too fast to be conscious of any"
"x35","moving things. The slowest snail that ever crawled dashed by too fast"
"x35","for me. The twinkling succession of darkness and light was excessively"
"x35","painful to the eye. Then, in the intermittent darknesses, I saw the"
"x35","moon spinning swiftly through her quarters from new to full, and had a"
"x35","faint glimpse of the circling stars. Presently, as I went on, still"
"x35","gaining velocity, the palpitation of night and day merged into one"
"x35","continuous greyness; the sky took on a wonderful deepness of blue, a"
"x35","splendid luminous colour like that of early twilight; the jerking sun"
"x35","became a streak of fire, a brilliant arch, in space; the moon a fainter"
"x35","fluctuating band; and I could see nothing of the stars, save now and"
"x35","then a brighter circle flickering in the blue."
"x35",""
"x35","“The landscape was misty and vague. I was still on the hillside upon"
"x35","which this house now stands, and the shoulder rose above me grey and"
"x35","dim. I saw trees growing and changing like puffs of vapour, now brown,"
"x35","now green; they grew, spread, shivered, and passed away. I saw huge"
"x35","buildings rise up faint and fair, and pass like dreams. The whole"
"x35","surface of the earth seemed changed—melting and flowing under my eyes."
"x35","The little hands upon the dials that registered my speed raced round"
"x35","faster and faster. Presently I noted that the sun belt swayed up and"
"x35","down, from solstice to solstice, in a minute or less, and that"
"x35","consequently my pace was over a year a minute; and minute by minute the"
"x35","white snow flashed across the world, and vanished, and was followed by"
"x35","the bright, brief green of spring."
"x35",""
"x35","“The unpleasant sensations of the start were less poignant now. They"
"x35","merged at last into a kind of hysterical exhilaration. I remarked,"
"x35","indeed, a clumsy swaying of the machine, for which I was unable to"
"x35","account. But my mind was too confused to attend to it, so with a kind"
"x35","of madness growing upon me, I flung myself into futurity. At first I"
"x35","scarce thought of stopping, scarce thought of anything but these new"
"x35","sensations. But presently a fresh series of impressions grew up in my"
"x35","mind—a certain curiosity and therewith a certain dread—until at last"
"x35","they took complete possession of me. What strange developments of"
"x35","humanity, what wonderful advances upon our rudimentary civilisation, I"
"x35","thought, might not appear when I came to look nearly into the dim"
"x35","elusive world that raced and fluctuated before my eyes! I saw great and"
"x35","splendid architecture rising about me, more massive than any buildings"
"x35","of our own time, and yet, as it seemed, built of glimmer and mist. I"
"x35","saw a richer green flow up the hillside, and remain there, without any"
"x35","wintry intermission. Even through the veil of my confusion the earth"
"x35","seemed very fair. And so my mind came round to the business of"
"x35","stopping."
"x35",""
"x35","“The peculiar risk lay in the possibility of my finding some substance"
"x35","in the space which I, or the machine, occupied. So long as I travelled"
"x35","at a high velocity through time, this scarcely mattered: I was, so to"
"x35","speak, attenuated—was slipping like a vapour through the interstices of"
"x35","intervening substances! But to come to a stop involved the jamming of"
"x35","myself, molecule by molecule, into whatever lay in my way; meant"
"x35","bringing my atoms into such intimate contact with those of the obstacle"
"x35","that a profound chemical reaction—possibly a far-reaching"
"x35","explosion—would result, and blow myself and my apparatus out of all"
"x35","possible dimensions—into the Unknown. This possibility had occurred to"
"x35","me again and again while I was making the machine; but then I had"
"x35","cheerfully accepted it as an unavoidable risk—one of the risks a man"
"x35","has got to take! Now the risk was inevitable, I no longer saw it in the"
"x35","same cheerful light. The fact is that, insensibly, the absolute"
"x35","strangeness of everything, the sickly jarring and swaying of the"
"x35","machine, above all, the feeling of prolonged falling, had absolutely"
"x35","upset my nerves. I told myself that I could never stop, and with a gust"
"x35","of petulance I resolved to stop forthwith. Like an impatient fool, I"
"x35","lugged over the lever, and incontinently the thing went reeling over,"
"x35","and I was flung headlong through the air."
"x35",""
"x35","“There was the sound of a clap of thunder in my ears. I may have been"
"x35","stunned for a moment. A pitiless hail was hissing round me, and I was"
"x35","sitting on soft turf in front of the overset machine. Everything still"
"x35","seemed grey, but presently I remarked that the confusion in my ears was"
"x35","gone. I looked round me. I was on what seemed to be a little lawn in a"
"x35","garden, surrounded by rhododendron bushes, and I noticed that their"
"x35","mauve and purple blossoms were dropping in a shower under the beating"
"x35","of the hailstones. The rebounding, dancing hail hung in a little cloud"
"x35","over the machine, and drove along the ground like smoke. In a moment I"
"x35","was wet to the skin. ‘Fine hospitality,’ said I, ‘to a man who has"
"x35","travelled innumerable years to see you.’"
"x35",""
"x35","“Presently I thought what a fool I was to get wet. I stood up and"
"x35","looked round me. A colossal figure, carved apparently in some white"
"x35","stone, loomed indistinctly beyond the rhododendrons through the hazy"
"x35","downpour. But all else of the world was invisible."
"x35",""
"x35","“My sensations would be hard to describe. As the columns of hail grew"
"x35","thinner, I saw the white figure more distinctly. It was very large, for"
"x35","a silver birch-tree touched its shoulder. It was of white marble, in"
"x35","shape something like a winged sphinx, but the wings, instead of being"
"x35","carried vertically at the sides, were spread so that it seemed to"
"x35","hover. The pedestal, it appeared to me, was of bronze, and was thick"
"x35","with verdigris. It chanced that the face was towards me; the sightless"
"x35","eyes seemed to watch me; there was the faint shadow of a smile on the"
"x35","lips. It was greatly weather-worn, and that imparted an unpleasant"
"x35","suggestion of disease. I stood looking at it for a little space—half a"
"x35","minute, perhaps, or half an hour. It seemed to advance and to recede as"
"x35","the hail drove before it denser or thinner. At last I tore my eyes from"
"x35","it for a moment, and saw that the hail curtain had worn threadbare, and"
"x35","that the sky was lightening with the promise of the sun."
"x35",""
"x35","“I looked up again at the crouching white shape, and the full temerity"
"x35","of my voyage came suddenly upon me. What might appear when that hazy"
"x35","curtain was altogether withdrawn? What might not have happened to men?"
"x35","What if cruelty had grown into a common passion? What if in this"
"x35","interval the race had lost its manliness, and had developed into"
"x35","something inhuman, unsympathetic, and overwhelmingly powerful? I might"
"x35","seem some old-world savage animal, only the more dreadful and"
"x35","disgusting for our common likeness—a foul creature to be incontinently"
"x35","slain."
"x35",""
"x35","“Already I saw other vast shapes—huge buildings with intricate parapets"
"x35","and tall columns, with a wooded hillside dimly creeping in upon me"
"x35","through the lessening storm. I was seized with a panic fear. I turned"
"x35","frantically to the Time Machine, and strove hard to readjust it. As I"
"x35","did so the shafts of the sun smote through the thunderstorm. The grey"
"x35","downpour was swept aside and vanished like the trailing garments of a"
"x35","ghost. Above me, in the intense blue of the summer sky, some faint"
"x35","brown shreds of cloud whirled into nothingness. The great buildings"
"x35","about me stood out clear and distinct, shining with the wet of the"
"x35","thunderstorm, and picked out in white by the unmelted hailstones piled"
"x35","along their courses. I felt naked in a strange world. I felt as perhaps"
"x35","a bird may feel in the clear air, knowing the hawk wings above and will"
"x35","swoop. My fear grew to frenzy. I took a breathing space, set my teeth,"
"x35","and again grappled fiercely, wrist and knee, with the machine. It gave"
"x35","under my desperate onset and turned over. It struck my chin violently."
"x35","One hand on the saddle, the other on the lever, I stood panting heavily"
"x35","in attitude to mount again."
"x35",""
"x35","“But with this recovery of a prompt retreat my courage recovered. I"
"x35","looked more curiously and less fearfully at this world of the remote"
"x35","future. In a circular opening, high up in the wall of the nearer house,"
"x35","I saw a group of figures clad in rich soft robes. They had seen me, and"
"x35","their faces were directed towards me."
"x35",""
"x35","“Then I heard voices approaching me. Coming through the bushes by the"
"x35","White Sphinx were the heads and shoulders of men running. One of these"
"x35","emerged in a pathway leading straight to the little lawn upon which I"
"x35","stood with my machine. He was a slight creature—perhaps four feet"
"x35","high—clad in a purple tunic, girdled at the waist with a leather belt."
"x35","Sandals or buskins—I could not clearly distinguish which—were on his"
"x35","feet; his legs were bare to the knees, and his head was bare. Noticing"
"x35","that, I noticed for the first time how warm the air was."
"x35",""
"x35","“He struck me as being a very beautiful and graceful creature, but"
"x35","indescribably frail. His flushed face reminded me of the more beautiful"
"x35","kind of consumptive—that hectic beauty of which we used to hear so"
"x35","much. At the sight of him I suddenly regained confidence. I took my"
"x35","hands from the machine."

"x35","thing out of futurity. He came straight up to me and laughed into my"
"x35","eyes. The absence from his bearing of any sign of fear struck me at"
"x35","once. Then he turned to the two others who were following him and spoke"
"x35","to them in a strange and very sweet and liquid tongue."
"x35",""
"x35","“There were others coming, and presently a little group of perhaps"
"x35","eight or ten of these exquisite creatures were about me. One of them"
"x35","addressed me. It came into my head, oddly enough, that my voice was too"
"x35","harsh and deep for them. So I shook my head, and, pointing to my ears,"
"x35","shook it again. He came a step forward, hesitated, and then touched my"
"x35","hand. Then I felt other soft little tentacles upon my back and"
"x35","shoulders. They wanted to make sure I was real. There was nothing in"
"x35","this at all alarming. Indeed, there was something in these pretty"
"x35","little people that inspired confidence—a graceful gentleness, a certain"
"x35","childlike ease. And besides, they looked so frail that I could fancy"
"x35","myself flinging the whole dozen of them about like ninepins. But I made"
"x35","a sudden motion to warn them when I saw their little pink hands feeling"
"x35","at the Time Machine. Happily then, when it was not too late, I thought"
"x35","of a danger I had hitherto forgotten, and reaching over the bars of the"
"x35","machine I unscrewed the little levers that would set it in motion, and"
"x35","put these in my pocket. Then I turned again to see what I could do in"
"x35","the way of communication."
"x35",""
"x35","“And then, looking more nearly into their features, I saw some further"
"x35","peculiarities in their Dresden china type of prettiness. Their hair,"
"x35","which was uniformly curly, came to a sharp end at the neck and cheek;"
"x35","there was not the faintest suggestion of it on the face, and their ears"
"x35","were singularly minute. The mouths were small, with bright red, rather"
"x35","thin lips, and the little chins ran to a point. The eyes were large and"
"x35","mild; and—this may seem egotism on my part—I fancied even that there"
"x35","was a certain lack of the interest I might have expected in them."
"x35",""
"x35","“As they made no effort to communicate with me, but simply stood round"
"x35","me smiling and speaking in soft cooing notes to each other, I began the"
"x35","conversation. I pointed to the Time Machine and to myself. Then,"
"x35","hesitating for a moment how to express Time, I pointed to the sun. At"
"x35","once a quaintly pretty little figure in chequered purple and white"
"x35","followed my gesture, and then astonished me by imitating the sound of"
"x35","thunder."
"x35",""
"x35","“For a moment I was staggered, though the import of his gesture was"
"x35","plain enough. The question had come into my mind abruptly: were these"
"x35","creatures fools? You may hardly understand how it took me. You see, I"
"x35","had always anticipated that the people of the year Eight Hundred and"
"x35","Two Thousand odd would be incredibly in front of us in knowledge, art,"
"x35","everything. Then one of them suddenly asked me a question that showed"
"x35","him to be on the intellectual level of one of our five-year-old"
"x35","children—asked me, in fact, if I had come from the sun in a"
"x35","thunderstorm! It let loose the judgment I had suspended upon their"
"x35","clothes, their frail light limbs, and fragile features. A flow of"
"x35","disappointment rushed across my mind. For a moment I felt that I had"
"x35","built the Time Machine in vain."
"x35",""
"x35","“I nodded, pointed to the sun, and gave them such a vivid rendering of"
"x35","a thunderclap as startled them. They all withdrew a pace or so and"
"x35","bowed. Then came one laughing towards me, carrying a chain of beautiful"
"x35","flowers altogether new to me, and put it about my neck. The idea was"
"x35","received with melodious applause; and presently they were all running"
"x35","to and fro for flowers, and laughingly flinging them upon me until I"
"x35","was almost smothered with blossom. You who have never seen the like can"
"x35","scarcely imagine what delicate and wonderful flowers countless years of"
"x35","culture had created. Then someone suggested that their plaything should"
"x35","be exhibited in the nearest building, and so I was led past the sphinx"
"x35","of white marble, which had seemed to watch me all the while with a"
"x35","smile at my astonishment, towards a vast grey edifice of fretted stone."
"x35","As I went with them the memory of my confident anticipations of a"
"x35","profoundly grave and intellectual posterity came, with irresistible"
"x35","merriment, to my mind."
"x35",""
"x35","“The building had a huge entry, and was altogether of colossal"
"x35","dimensions. I was naturally most occupied with the growing crowd of"
"x35","little people, and with the big open portals that yawned before me"
"x35","shadowy and mysterious. My general impression of the world I saw over"
"x35","their heads was a tangled waste of beautiful bushes and flowers, a long"
"x35","neglected and yet weedless garden. I saw a number of tall spikes of"
"x35","strange white flowers, measuring a foot perhaps across the spread of"
"x35","the waxen petals. They grew scattered, as if wild, among the variegated"
"x35","shrubs, but, as I say, I did not examine them closely at this time. The"
"x35","Time Machine was left deserted on the turf among the rhododendrons."
"x35",""
"x35","“The arch of the doorway was richly carved, but naturally I did not"
"x35","observe the carving very narrowly, though I fancied I saw suggestions"
"x35","of old Phœnician decorations as I passed through, and it struck me that"
"x35","they were very badly broken and weather-worn. Several more brightly"
"x35","clad people met me in the doorway, and so we entered, I, dressed in"
"x35","dingy nineteenth-century garments, looking grotesque enough, garlanded"
"x35","with flowers, and surrounded by an eddying mass of bright,"
"x35","soft-coloured robes and shining white limbs, in a melodious whirl of"
"x35","laughter and laughing speech."
"x35",""
"x35","“The big doorway opened into a proportionately great hall hung with"
"x35","brown. The roof was in shadow, and the windows, partially glazed with"
"x35","coloured glass and partially unglazed, admitted a tempered light. The"
"x35","floor was made up of huge blocks of some very hard white metal, not"
"x35","plates nor slabs—blocks, and it was so much worn, as I judged by the"
"x35","going to and fro of past generations, as to be deeply channelled along"
"x35","the more frequented ways. Transverse to the length were innumerable"
"x35","tables made of slabs of polished stone, raised, perhaps, a foot from"
"x35","the floor, and upon these were heaps of fruits. Some I recognised as a"
"x35","kind of hypertrophied raspberry and orange, but for the most part they"
"x35","were strange."
"x35",""
"x35","“Between the tables was scattered a great number of cushions. Upon"
"x35","these my conductors seated themselves, signing for me to do likewise."
"x35","With a pretty absence of ceremony they began to eat the fruit with"
"x35","their hands, flinging peel and stalks, and so forth, into the round"
"x35","openings in the sides of the tables. I was not loath to follow their"
"x35","example, for I felt thirsty and hungry. As I did so I surveyed the hall"
"x35","at my leisure."
"x35",""
"x35","“And perhaps the thing that struck me most was its dilapidated look."
"x35","The stained-glass windows, which displayed only a geometrical pattern,"
"x35","were broken in many places, and the curtains that hung across the lower"
"x35","end were thick with dust. And it caught my eye that the corner of the"
"x35","marble table near me was fractured. Nevertheless, the general effect"
"x35","was extremely rich and picturesque. There were, perhaps, a couple of"
"x35","hundred people dining in the hall, and most of them, seated as near to"
"x35","me as they could come, were watching me with interest, their little"
"x35","eyes shining over the fruit they were eating. All were clad in the same"
"x35","soft, and yet strong, silky material."
"x35",""
"x35","“Fruit, by the bye, was all their diet. These people of the remote"
"x35","future were strict vegetarians, and while I was with them, in spite of"
"x35","some carnal cravings, I had to be frugivorous also. Indeed, I found"
"x35","afterwards that horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, had followed the"
"x35","Ichthyosaurus into extinction. But the fruits were very delightful;"
"x35","one, in particular, that seemed to be in season all the time I was"
"x35","there—a floury thing in a three-sided husk—was especially good, and I"
"x35","made it my staple. At first I was puzzled by all these strange fruits,"
"x35","and by the strange flowers I saw, but later I began to perceive their"
"x35","import."
"x35",""
"x35","“However, I am telling you of my fruit dinner in the distant future"
"x35","now. So soon as my appetite was a little checked, I determined to make"
"x35","a resolute attempt to learn the speech of these new men of mine."
"x35","Clearly that was the next thing to do. The fruits seemed a convenient"
"x35","thing to begin upon, and holding one of these up I began a series of"
"x35","interrogative sounds and gestures. I had some considerable difficulty"
"x35","in conveying my meaning. At first my efforts met with a stare of"
"x35","surprise or inextinguishable laughter, but presently a fair-haired"
"x35","little creature seemed to grasp my intention and repeated a name. They"
"x35","had to chatter and explain the business at great length to each other,"
"x35","and my first attempts to make the exquisite little sounds of their"
"x35","language caused an immense amount of genuine, if uncivil, amusement."
"x35","However, I felt like a schoolmaster amidst children, and persisted, and"
"x35","presently I had a score of noun substantives at least at my command;"
"x35","and then I got to demonstrative pronouns, and even the verb ‘to eat.’"
"x35","But it was slow work, and the little people soon tired and wanted to"
"x35","get away from my interrogations, so I determined, rather of necessity,"
"x35","to let them give their lessons in little doses when they felt inclined."
"x35","And very little doses I found they were before long, for I never met"
"x35","people more indolent or more easily fatigued."

"x35","great heap of granite, bound together by masses of aluminium, a vast"
"x35","labyrinth of precipitous walls and crumpled heaps, amidst which were"
"x35","thick heaps of very beautiful pagoda-like plants—nettles possibly—but"
"x35","wonderfully tinted with brown about the leaves, and incapable of"

"x35","visage, and the same girlish rotundity of limb. It may seem strange,"
"x35","perhaps, that I had not noticed this before. But everything was so"
"x35","strange. Now, I saw the fact plainly enough. In costume, and in all the"
"x35","differences of texture and bearing that now mark off the sexes from"
"x35","each other, these people of the future were alike. And the children"
"x35","seemed to my eyes to be but the miniatures of their parents. I judged"
"x35","then that the children of that time were extremely precocious,"
"x35","physically at least, and I found afterwards abundant verification of my"
"x35","opinion."
"x35",""
"x35","“Seeing the ease and security in which these people were living, I felt"
"x35","that this close resemblance of the sexes was after all what one would"
"x35","expect; for the strength of a man and the softness of a woman, the"
"x35","institution of the family, and the differentiation of occupations are"
"x35","mere militant necessities of an age of physical force. Where population"
"x35","is balanced and abundant, much childbearing becomes an evil rather than"
"x35","a blessing to the State; where violence comes but rarely and offspring"
"x35","are secure, there is less necessity—indeed there is no necessity—for an"
"x35","efficient family, and the specialisation of the sexes with reference to"
"x35","their children’s needs disappears. We see some beginnings of this even"

"x35","the thread of my speculations. There were no large buildings towards"
"x35","the top of the hill, and as my walking powers were evidently"

"x35","view as I have ever seen. The sun had already gone below the horizon"
"x35","and the west was flaming gold, touched with some horizontal bars of"

"x35","logical consequence enough. Strength is the outcome of need; security"
"x35","sets a premium on feebleness. The work of ameliorating the conditions"
"x35","of life—the true civilising process that makes life more and more"

"x35","“After all, the sanitation and the agriculture of today are still in"
"x35","the rudimentary stage. The science of our time has attacked but a"
"x35","little department of the field of human disease, but, even so, it"
"x35","spreads its operations very steadily and persistently. Our agriculture"
"x35","and horticulture destroy a weed just here and there and cultivate"
"x35","perhaps a score or so of wholesome plants, leaving the greater number"
"x35","to fight out a balance as they can. We improve our favourite plants and"

"x35","flower, now a more convenient breed of cattle. We improve them"
"x35","gradually, because our ideals are vague and tentative, and our"
"x35","knowledge is very limited; because Nature, too, is shy and slow in our"
"x35","clumsy hands. Some day all this will be better organised, and still"
"x35","better. That is the drift of the current in spite of the eddies. The"
"x35","whole world will be intelligent, educated, and co-operating; things"
"x35","will move faster and faster towards the subjugation of Nature. In the"

"x35","hindrances—to a civilised man. And in a state of physical balance and"
"x35","security, power, intellectual as well as physical, would be out of"

"x35","distinct as the light of the rising moon grew brighter. I could see the"
"x35","silver birch against it. There was the tangle of rhododendron bushes,"
"x35","black in the pale light, and there was the little lawn. I looked at the"

"x35","“At once, like a lash across the face, came the possibility of losing"
"x35","my own age, of being left helpless in this strange new world. The bare"
"x35","thought of it was an actual physical sensation. I could feel it grip me"
"x35","at the throat and stop my breathing. In another moment I was in a"
"x35","passion of fear and running with great leaping strides down the slope."
"x35","Once I fell headlong and cut my face; I lost no time in stanching the"

"x35","chin. All the time I ran I was saying to myself: ‘They have moved it a"
"x35","little, pushed it under the bushes out of the way.’ Nevertheless, I ran"
"x35","with all my might. All the time, with the certainty that sometimes"
"x35","comes with excessive dread, I knew that such assurance was folly, knew"
"x35","instinctively that the machine was removed out of my reach. My breath"
"x35","came with pain. I suppose I covered the whole distance from the hill"
"x35","crest to the little lawn, two miles perhaps, in ten minutes. And I am"
"x35","not a young man. I cursed aloud, as I ran, at my confident folly in"

"x35","my hands clutching my hair. Above me towered the sphinx, upon the"

"x35","in my course, went blundering across the big dining-hall again, out"
"x35","under the moonlight. I heard cries of terror and their little feet"
"x35","running and stumbling this way and that. I do not remember all I did as"
"x35","the moon crept up the sky. I suppose it was the unexpected nature of my"
"x35","loss that maddened me. I felt hopelessly cut off from my own kind—a"
"x35","strange animal in an unknown world. I must have raved to and fro,"
"x35","screaming and crying upon God and Fate. I have a memory of horrible"
"x35","fatigue, as the long night of despair wore away; of looking in this"
"x35","impossible place and that; of groping among moonlit ruins and touching"
"x35","strange creatures in the black shadows; at last, of lying on the ground"
"x35","near the sphinx and weeping with absolute wretchedness, even anger at"
"x35","the folly of leaving the machine having leaked away with my strength. I"
"x35","had nothing left but misery. Then I slept, and when I woke again it was"
"x35","full day, and a couple of sparrows were hopping round me on the turf"
"x35","within reach of my arm."
"x35",""
"x35","“I sat up in the freshness of the morning, trying to remember how I had"
"x35","got there, and why I had such a profound sense of desertion and"
"x35","despair. Then things came clear in my mind. With the plain, reasonable"
"x35","daylight, I could look my circumstances fairly in the face. I saw the"
"x35","wild folly of my frenzy overnight, and I could reason with myself."
"x35","‘Suppose the worst?’ I said. ‘Suppose the machine altogether"
"x35","lost—perhaps destroyed? It behoves me to be calm and patient, to learn"
"x35","the way of the people, to get a clear idea of the method of my loss,"
"x35","and the means of getting materials and tools; so that in the end,"
"x35","perhaps, I may make another.’ That would be my only hope, a poor hope,"
"x35","perhaps, but better than despair. And, after all, it was a beautiful"
"x35","and curious world."
"x35",""
"x35","“But probably the machine had only been taken away. Still, I must be"
"x35","calm and patient, find its hiding-place, and recover it by force or"
"x35","cunning. And with that I scrambled to my feet and looked about me,"
"x35","wondering where I could bathe. I felt weary, stiff, and travel-soiled."
"x35","The freshness of the morning made me desire an equal freshness. I had"
"x35","exhausted my emotion. Indeed, as I went about my business, I found"
"x35","myself wondering at my intense excitement overnight. I made a careful"
"x35","examination of the ground about the little lawn. I wasted some time in"
"x35","futile questionings, conveyed, as well as I was able, to such of the"
"x35","little people as came by. They all failed to understand my gestures;"
"x35","some were simply stolid, some thought it was a jest and laughed at me."
"x35","I had the hardest task in the world to keep my hands off their pretty"
"x35","laughing faces. It was a foolish impulse, but the devil begotten of"
"x35","fear and blind anger was ill curbed and still eager to take advantage"
"x35","of my perplexity. The turf gave better counsel. I found a groove ripped"
"x35","in it, about midway between the pedestal of the sphinx and the marks of"
"x35","my feet where, on arrival, I had struggled with the overturned machine."
"x35","There were other signs of removal about, with queer narrow footprints"
"x35","like those I could imagine made by a sloth. This directed my closer"
"x35","attention to the pedestal. It was, as I think I have said, of bronze."
"x35","It was not a mere block, but highly decorated with deep framed panels"
"x35","on either side. I went and rapped at these. The pedestal was hollow."
"x35","Examining the panels with care I found them discontinuous with the"
"x35","frames. There were no handles or keyholes, but possibly the panels, if"
"x35","they were doors, as I supposed, opened from within. One thing was clear"
"x35","enough to my mind. It took no very great mental effort to infer that my"
"x35","Time Machine was inside that pedestal. But how it got there was a"
"x35","different problem."
"x35",""
"x35","“I saw the heads of two orange-clad people coming through the bushes"
"x35","and under some blossom-covered apple-trees towards me. I turned smiling"
"x35","to them, and beckoned them to me. They came, and then, pointing to the"
"x35","bronze pedestal, I tried to intimate my wish to open it. But at my"
"x35","first gesture towards this they behaved very oddly. I don’t know how to"
"x35","convey their expression to you. Suppose you were to use a grossly"
"x35","improper gesture to a delicate-minded woman—it is how she would look."
"x35","They went off as if they had received the last possible insult. I tried"
"x35","a sweet-looking little chap in white next, with exactly the same"
"x35","result. Somehow, his manner made me feel ashamed of myself. But, as you"
"x35","know, I wanted the Time Machine, and I tried him once more. As he"
"x35","turned off, like the others, my temper got the better of me. In three"
"x35","strides I was after him, had him by the loose part of his robe round"
"x35","the neck, and began dragging him towards the sphinx. Then I saw the"
"x35","horror and repugnance of his face, and all of a sudden I let him go."
"x35",""
"x35","“But I was not beaten yet. I banged with my fist at the bronze panels."
"x35","I thought I heard something stir inside—to be explicit, I thought I"
"x35","heard a sound like a chuckle—but I must have been mistaken. Then I got"
"x35","a big pebble from the river, and came and hammered till I had flattened"
"x35","a coil in the decorations, and the verdigris came off in powdery"
"x35","flakes. The delicate little people must have heard me hammering in"
"x35","gusty outbreaks a mile away on either hand, but nothing came of it. I"
"x35","saw a crowd of them upon the slopes, looking furtively at me. At last,"
"x35","hot and tired, I sat down to watch the place. But I was too restless to"
"x35","watch long; I am too Occidental for a long vigil. I could work at a"
"x35","problem for years, but to wait inactive for twenty-four hours—that is"
"x35","another matter."
"x35",""
"x35","“I got up after a time, and began walking aimlessly through the bushes"
"x35","towards the hill again. ‘Patience,’ said I to myself. ‘If you want your"
"x35","machine again you must leave that sphinx alone. If they mean to take"
"x35","your machine away, it’s little good your wrecking their bronze panels,"
"x35","and if they don’t, you will get it back as soon as you can ask for it."
"x35","To sit among all those unknown things before a puzzle like that is"
"x35","hopeless. That way lies monomania. Face this world. Learn its ways,"
"x35","watch it, be careful of too hasty guesses at its meaning. In the end"
"x35","you will find clues to it all.’ Then suddenly the humour of the"
"x35","situation came into my mind: the thought of the years I had spent in"
"x35","study and toil to get into the future age, and now my passion of"
"x35","anxiety to get out of it. I had made myself the most complicated and"
"x35","the most hopeless trap that ever a man devised. Although it was at my"
"x35","own expense, I could not help myself. I laughed aloud."
"x35",""
"x35","“Going through the big palace, it seemed to me that the little people"
"x35","avoided me. It may have been my fancy, or it may have had something to"
"x35","do with my hammering at the gates of bronze. Yet I felt tolerably sure"
"x35","of the avoidance. I was careful, however, to show no concern and to"
"x35","abstain from any pursuit of them, and in the course of a day or two"
"x35","things got back to the old footing. I made what progress I could in the"
"x35","language, and in addition I pushed my explorations here and there."
"x35","Either I missed some subtle point or their language was excessively"
"x35","simple—almost exclusively composed of concrete substantives and verbs."
"x35","There seemed to be few, if any, abstract terms, or little use of"
"x35","figurative language. Their sentences were usually simple and of two"
"x35","words, and I failed to convey or understand any but the simplest"
"x35","propositions. I determined to put the thought of my Time Machine and"
"x35","the mystery of the bronze doors under the sphinx, as much as possible"
"x35","in a corner of memory, until my growing knowledge would lead me back to"
"x35","them in a natural way. Yet a certain feeling, you may understand,"
"x35","tethered me in a circle of a few miles round the point of my arrival."

"x35"," VIII."
"x35"," Explanation"
"x35",""
"x35",""
"x35","“So far as I could see, all the world displayed the same exuberant"
"x35","richness as the Thames valley. From every hill I climbed I saw the same"
"x35","abundance of splendid buildings, endlessly varied in material and"
"x35","style, the same clustering thickets of evergreens, the same"
"x35","blossom-laden trees and tree ferns. Here and there water shone like"
"x35","silver, and beyond, the land rose into blue undulating hills, and so"
"x35","faded into the serenity of the sky. A peculiar feature, which presently"
"x35","attracted my attention, was the presence of certain circular wells,"
"x35","several, as it seemed to me, of a very great depth. One lay by the path"
"x35","up the hill which I had followed during my first walk. Like the others,"
"x35","it was rimmed with bronze, curiously wrought, and protected by a little"
"x35","cupola from the rain. Sitting by the side of these wells, and peering"
"x35","down into the shafted darkness, I could see no gleam of water, nor"
"x35","could I start any reflection with a lighted match. But in all of them I"
"x35","heard a certain sound: a thud—thud—thud, like the beating of some big"
"x35","engine; and I discovered, from the flaring of my matches, that a steady"
"x35","current of air set down the shafts. Further, I threw a scrap of paper"
"x35","into the throat of one, and, instead of fluttering slowly down, it was"
"x35","at once sucked swiftly out of sight."
"x35",""
"x35","“After a time, too, I came to connect these wells with tall towers"
"x35","standing here and there upon the slopes; for above them there was often"
"x35","just such a flicker in the air as one sees on a hot day above a"
"x35","sun-scorched beach. Putting things together, I reached a strong"
"x35","suggestion of an extensive system of subterranean ventilation, whose"
"x35","true import it was difficult to imagine. I was at first inclined to"
"x35","associate it with the sanitary apparatus of these people. It was an"
"x35","obvious conclusion, but it was absolutely wrong."
"x35",""
"x35","“And here I must admit that I learnt very little of drains and bells"
"x35","and modes of conveyance, and the like conveniences, during my time in"
"x35","this real future. In some of these visions of Utopias and coming times"
"x35","which I have read, there is a vast amount of detail about building, and"
"x35","social arrangements, and so forth. But while such details are easy"
"x35","enough to obtain when the whole world is contained in one’s"
"x35","imagination, they are altogether inaccessible to a real traveller amid"
"x35","such realities as I found here. Conceive the tale of London which a"
"x35","negro, fresh from Central Africa, would take back to his tribe! What"
"x35","would he know of railway companies, of social movements, of telephone"
"x35","and telegraph wires, of the Parcels Delivery Company, and postal orders"
"x35","and the like? Yet we, at least, should be willing enough to explain"
"x35","these things to him! And even of what he knew, how much could he make"
"x35","his untravelled friend either apprehend or believe? Then, think how"
"x35","narrow the gap between a negro and a white man of our own times, and"
"x35","how wide the interval between myself and these of the Golden Age! I was"
"x35","sensible of much which was unseen, and which contributed to my comfort;"
"x35","but save for a general impression of automatic organisation, I fear I"
"x35","can convey very little of the difference to your mind."
"x35",""
"x35","“In the matter of sepulture, for instance, I could see no signs of"
"x35","crematoria nor anything suggestive of tombs. But it occurred to me"
"x35","that, possibly, there might be cemeteries (or crematoria) somewhere"
"x35","beyond the range of my explorings. This, again, was a question I"
"x35","deliberately put to myself, and my curiosity was at first entirely"
"x35","defeated upon the point. The thing puzzled me, and I was led to make a"
"x35","further remark, which puzzled me still more: that aged and infirm among"
"x35","this people there were none."
"x35",""
"x35","“I must confess that my satisfaction with my first theories of an"
"x35","automatic civilisation and a decadent humanity did not long endure. Yet"
"x35","I could think of no other. Let me put my difficulties. The several big"
"x35","palaces I had explored were mere living places, great dining-halls and"
"x35","sleeping apartments. I could find no machinery, no appliances of any"
"x35","kind. Yet these people were clothed in pleasant fabrics that must at"
"x35","times need renewal, and their sandals, though undecorated, were fairly"
"x35","complex specimens of metalwork. Somehow such things must be made. And"
"x35","the little people displayed no vestige of a creative tendency. There"
"x35","were no shops, no workshops, no sign of importations among them. They"
"x35","spent all their time in playing gently, in bathing in the river, in"
"x35","making love in a half-playful fashion, in eating fruit and sleeping. I"
"x35","could not see how things were kept going."
"x35",""
"x35","“Then, again, about the Time Machine: something, I knew not what, had"
"x35","taken it into the hollow pedestal of the White Sphinx. _Why?_ For the"
"x35","life of me I could not imagine. Those waterless wells, too, those"
"x35","flickering pillars. I felt I lacked a clue. I felt—how shall I put it?"
"x35","Suppose you found an inscription, with sentences here and there in"
"x35","excellent plain English, and interpolated therewith, others made up of"
"x35","words, of letters even, absolutely unknown to you? Well, on the third"
"x35","day of my visit, that was how the world of Eight Hundred and Two"
"x35","Thousand Seven Hundred and One presented itself to me!"
"x35",""
"x35","“That day, too, I made a friend—of a sort. It happened that, as I was"
"x35","watching some of the little people bathing in a shallow, one of them"
"x35","was seized with cramp and began drifting downstream. The main current"
"x35","ran rather swiftly, but not too strongly for even a moderate swimmer."
"x35","It will give you an idea, therefore, of the strange deficiency in these"
"x35","creatures, when I tell you that none made the slightest attempt to"
"x35","rescue the weakly crying little thing which was drowning before their"
"x35","eyes. When I realised this, I hurriedly slipped off my clothes, and,"
"x35","wading in at a point lower down, I caught the poor mite and drew her"
"x35","safe to land. A little rubbing of the limbs soon brought her round, and"
"x35","I had the satisfaction of seeing she was all right before I left her. I"
"x35","had got to such a low estimate of her kind that I did not expect any"
"x35","gratitude from her. In that, however, I was wrong."
"x35",""
"x35","“This happened in the morning. In the afternoon I met my little woman,"
"x35","as I believe it was, as I was returning towards my centre from an"
"x35","exploration, and she received me with cries of delight and presented me"
"x35","with a big garland of flowers—evidently made for me and me alone. The"
"x35","thing took my imagination. Very possibly I had been feeling desolate."
"x35","At any rate I did my best to display my appreciation of the gift. We"
"x35","were soon seated together in a little stone arbour, engaged in"
"x35","conversation, chiefly of smiles. The creature’s friendliness affected"
"x35","me exactly as a child’s might have done. We passed each other flowers,"
"x35","and she kissed my hands. I did the same to hers. Then I tried talk, and"
"x35","found that her name was Weena, which, though I don’t know what it"
"x35","meant, somehow seemed appropriate enough. That was the beginning of a"
"x35","queer friendship which lasted a week, and ended—as I will tell you!"
"x35",""
"x35","“She was exactly like a child. She wanted to be with me always. She"
"x35","tried to follow me everywhere, and on my next journey out and about it"
"x35","went to my heart to tire her down, and leave her at last, exhausted and"
"x35","calling after me rather plaintively. But the problems of the world had"
"x35","to be mastered. I had not, I said to myself, come into the future to"
"x35","carry on a miniature flirtation. Yet her distress when I left her was"
"x35","very great, her expostulations at the parting were sometimes frantic,"
"x35","and I think, altogether, I had as much trouble as comfort from her"
"x35","devotion. Nevertheless she was, somehow, a very great comfort. I"
"x35","thought it was mere childish affection that made her cling to me. Until"
"x35","it was too late, I did not clearly know what I had inflicted upon her"
"x35","when I left her. Nor until it was too late did I clearly understand"
"x35","what she was to me. For, by merely seeming fond of me, and showing in"
"x35","her weak, futile way that she cared for me, the little doll of a"
"x35","creature presently gave my return to the neighbourhood of the White"
"x35","Sphinx almost the feeling of coming home; and I would watch for her"
"x35","tiny figure of white and gold so soon as I came over the hill."
"x35",""
"x35","“It was from her, too, that I learnt that fear had not yet left the"
"x35","world. She was fearless enough in the daylight, and she had the oddest"
"x35","confidence in me; for once, in a foolish moment, I made threatening"
"x35","grimaces at her, and she simply laughed at them. But she dreaded the"
"x35","dark, dreaded shadows, dreaded black things. Darkness to her was the"
"x35","one thing dreadful. It was a singularly passionate emotion, and it set"
"x35","me thinking and observing. I discovered then, among other things, that"
"x35","these little people gathered into the great houses after dark, and"
"x35","slept in droves. To enter upon them without a light was to put them"
"x35","into a tumult of apprehension. I never found one out of doors, or one"
"x35","sleeping alone within doors, after dark. Yet I was still such a"
"x35","blockhead that I missed the lesson of that fear, and in spite of"
"x35","Weena’s distress, I insisted upon sleeping away from these slumbering"
"x35","multitudes."
"x35",""
"x35","“It troubled her greatly, but in the end her odd affection for me"
"x35","triumphed, and for five of the nights of our acquaintance, including"
"x35","the last night of all, she slept with her head pillowed on my arm. But"
"x35","my story slips away from me as I speak of her. It must have been the"
"x35","night before her rescue that I was awakened about dawn. I had been"
"x35","restless, dreaming most disagreeably that I was drowned, and that sea"
"x35","anemones were feeling over my face with their soft palps. I woke with a"
"x35","start, and with an odd fancy that some greyish animal had just rushed"
"x35","out of the chamber. I tried to get to sleep again, but I felt restless"
"x35","and uncomfortable. It was that dim grey hour when things are just"
"x35","creeping out of darkness, when everything is colourless and clear cut,"
"x35","and yet unreal. I got up, and went down into the great hall, and so out"
"x35","upon the flagstones in front of the palace. I thought I would make a"
"x35","virtue of necessity, and see the sunrise."
"x35",""
"x35","“The moon was setting, and the dying moonlight and the first pallor of"
"x35","dawn were mingled in a ghastly half-light. The bushes were inky black,"
"x35","the ground a sombre grey, the sky colourless and cheerless. And up the"
"x35","hill I thought I could see ghosts. Three several times, as I scanned"
"x35","the slope, I saw white figures. Twice I fancied I saw a solitary white,"
"x35","ape-like creature running rather quickly up the hill, and once near the"
"x35","ruins I saw a leash of them carrying some dark body. They moved"
"x35","hastily. I did not see what became of them. It seemed that they"
"x35","vanished among the bushes. The dawn was still indistinct, you must"
"x35","understand. I was feeling that chill, uncertain, early-morning feeling"
"x35","you may have known. I doubted my eyes."
"x35",""
"x35","“As the eastern sky grew brighter, and the light of the day came on and"
"x35","its vivid colouring returned upon the world once more, I scanned the"
"x35","view keenly. But I saw no vestige of my white figures. They were mere"
"x35","creatures of the half-light. ‘They must have been ghosts,’ I said; ‘I"
"x35","wonder whence they dated.’ For a queer notion of Grant Allen’s came"
"x35","into my head, and amused me. If each generation die and leave ghosts,"
"x35","he argued, the world at last will get overcrowded with them. On that"
"x35","theory they would have grown innumerable some Eight Hundred Thousand"
"x35","Years hence, and it was no great wonder to see four at once. But the"
"x35","jest was unsatisfying, and I was thinking of these figures all the"
"x35","morning, until Weena’s rescue drove them out of my head. I associated"
"x35","them in some indefinite way with the white animal I had startled in my"
"x35","first passionate search for the Time Machine. But Weena was a pleasant"
"x35","substitute. Yet all the same, they were soon destined to take far"
"x35","deadlier possession of my mind."
"x35",""
"x35","“I think I have said how much hotter than our own was the weather of"
"x35","this Golden Age. I cannot account for it. It may be that the sun was"
"x35","hotter, or the earth nearer the sun. It is usual to assume that the sun"
"x35","will go on cooling steadily in the future. But people, unfamiliar with"
"x35","such speculations as those of the younger Darwin, forget that the"
"x35","planets must ultimately fall back one by one into the parent body. As"
"x35","these catastrophes occur, the sun will blaze with renewed energy; and"
"x35","it may be that some inner planet had suffered this fate. Whatever the"
"x35","reason, the fact remains that the sun was very much hotter than we know"
"x35","it."

"x35","“Well, one very hot morning—my fourth, I think—as I was seeking shelter"
"x35","from the heat and glare in a colossal ruin near the great house where I"
"x35","slept and fed, there happened this strange thing. Clambering among"
"x35","these heaps of masonry, I found a narrow gallery, whose end and side"
"x35","windows were blocked by fallen masses of stone. By contrast with the"
"x35","brilliancy outside, it seemed at first impenetrably dark to me. I"
"x35","entered it groping, for the change from light to blackness made spots"
"x35","of colour swim before me. Suddenly I halted spellbound. A pair of eyes,"
"x35","luminous by reflection against the daylight without, was watching me"
"x35","out of the darkness."
"x35",""
"x35","“The old instinctive dread of wild beasts came upon me. I clenched my"

"x35","strange terror of the dark. Overcoming my fear to some extent, I"
"x35","advanced a step and spoke. I will admit that my voice was harsh and"
"x35","ill-controlled. I put out my hand and touched something soft. At once"
"x35","the eyes darted sideways, and something white ran past me. I turned"
"x35","with my heart in my mouth, and saw a queer little ape-like figure, its"
"x35","head held down in a peculiar manner, running across the sunlit space"
"x35","behind me. It blundered against a block of granite, staggered aside,"
"x35","and in a moment was hidden in a black shadow beneath another pile of"
"x35","ruined masonry."

"x35","“My impression of it is, of course, imperfect; but I know it was a dull"
"x35","white, and had strange large greyish-red eyes; also that there was"

"x35","fast for me to see distinctly. I cannot even say whether it ran on all"
"x35","fours, or only with its forearms held very low. After an instant’s"
"x35","pause I followed it into the second heap of ruins. I could not find it"
"x35","at first; but, after a time in the profound obscurity, I came upon one"
"x35","of those round well-like openings of which I have told you, half closed"
"x35","by a fallen pillar. A sudden thought came to me. Could this Thing have"
"x35","vanished down the shaft? I lit a match, and, looking down, I saw a"
"x35","small, white, moving creature, with large bright eyes which regarded me"
"x35","steadfastly as it retreated. It made me shudder. It was so like a human"
"x35","spider! It was clambering down the wall, and now I saw for the first"
"x35","time a number of metal foot and hand rests forming a kind of ladder"
"x35","down the shaft. Then the light burned my fingers and fell out of my"
"x35","hand, going out as it dropped, and when I had lit another the little"

"x35","had not remained one species, but had differentiated into two distinct"
"x35","animals: that my graceful children of the Upper World were not the sole"
"x35","descendants of our generation, but that this bleached, obscene,"

"x35","that shaft? I sat upon the edge of the well telling myself that, at any"
"x35","rate, there was nothing to fear, and that there I must descend for the"
"x35","solution of my difficulties. And withal I was absolutely afraid to go!"
"x35","As I hesitated, two of the beautiful upperworld people came running in"
"x35","their amorous sport across the daylight in the shadow. The male pursued"
"x35","the female, flinging flowers at her as he ran."
"x35",""
"x35","“They seemed distressed to find me, my arm against the overturned"
"x35","pillar, peering down the well. Apparently it was considered bad form to"
"x35","remark these apertures; for when I pointed to this one, and tried to"
"x35","frame a question about it in their tongue, they were still more visibly"
"x35","distressed and turned away. But they were interested by my matches, and"
"x35","I struck some to amuse them. I tried them again about the well, and"
"x35","again I failed. So presently I left them, meaning to go back to Weena,"
"x35","and see what I could get from her. But my mind was already in"
"x35","revolution; my guesses and impressions were slipping and sliding to a"
"x35","new adjustment. I had now a clue to the import of these wells, to the"
"x35","ventilating towers, to the mystery of the ghosts; to say nothing of a"
"x35","hint at the meaning of the bronze gates and the fate of the Time"
"x35","Machine! And very vaguely there came a suggestion towards the solution"
"x35","of the economic problem that had puzzled me."
"x35",""
"x35","“Here was the new view. Plainly, this second species of Man was"
"x35","subterranean. There were three circumstances in particular which made"
"x35","me think that its rare emergence above ground was the outcome of a"
"x35","long-continued underground habit. In the first place, there was the"
"x35","bleached look common in most animals that live largely in the dark—the"
"x35","white fish of the Kentucky caves, for instance. Then, those large eyes,"
"x35","with that capacity for reflecting light, are common features of"
"x35","nocturnal things—witness the owl and the cat. And last of all, that"
"x35","evident confusion in the sunshine, that hasty yet fumbling awkward"
"x35","flight towards dark shadow, and that peculiar carriage of the head"
"x35","while in the light—all reinforced the theory of an extreme"
"x35","sensitiveness of the retina."
"x35",""
"x35","“Beneath my feet, then, the earth must be tunnelled enormously, and"
"x35","these tunnellings were the habitat of the New Race. The presence of"
"x35","ventilating shafts and wells along the hill slopes—everywhere, in fact,"
"x35","except along the river valley—showed how universal were its"
"x35","ramifications. What so natural, then, as to assume that it was in this"
"x35","artificial Underworld that such work as was necessary to the comfort of"
"x35","the daylight race was done? The notion was so plausible that I at once"
"x35","accepted it, and went on to assume the _how_ of this splitting of the"
"x35","human species. I dare say you will anticipate the shape of my theory;"
"x35","though, for myself, I very soon felt that it fell far short of the"
"x35","truth."
"x35",""
"x35","“At first, proceeding from the problems of our own age, it seemed clear"
"x35","as daylight to me that the gradual widening of the present merely"
"x35","temporary and social difference between the Capitalist and the Labourer"
"x35","was the key to the whole position. No doubt it will seem grotesque"
"x35","enough to you—and wildly incredible!—and yet even now there are"
"x35","existing circumstances to point that way. There is a tendency to"
"x35","utilise underground space for the less ornamental purposes of"
"x35","civilisation; there is the Metropolitan Railway in London, for"
"x35","instance, there are new electric railways, there are subways, there are"
"x35","underground workrooms and restaurants, and they increase and multiply."
"x35","Evidently, I thought, this tendency had increased till Industry had"
"x35","gradually lost its birthright in the sky. I mean that it had gone"
"x35","deeper and deeper into larger and ever larger underground factories,"
"x35","spending a still-increasing amount of its time therein, till, in the"
"x35","end—! Even now, does not an East-end worker live in such artificial"
"x35","conditions as practically to be cut off from the natural surface of the"
"x35","earth?"
"x35",""
"x35","“Again, the exclusive tendency of richer people—due, no doubt, to the"
"x35","increasing refinement of their education, and the widening gulf between"
"x35","them and the rude violence of the poor—is already leading to the"
"x35","closing, in their interest, of considerable portions of the surface of"
"x35","the land. About London, for instance, perhaps half the prettier country"
"x35","is shut in against intrusion. And this same widening gulf—which is due"
"x35","to the length and expense of the higher educational process and the"
"x35","increased facilities for and temptations towards refined habits on the"
"x35","part of the rich—will make that exchange between class and class, that"
"x35","promotion by intermarriage which at present retards the splitting of"
"x35","our species along lines of social stratification, less and less"
"x35","frequent. So, in the end, above ground you must have the Haves,"
"x35","pursuing pleasure and comfort and beauty, and below ground the"
"x35","Have-nots, the Workers getting continually adapted to the conditions of"
"x35","their labour. Once they were there, they would no doubt have to pay"
"x35","rent, and not a little of it, for the ventilation of their caverns; and"
"x35","if they refused, they would starve or be suffocated for arrears. Such"
"x35","of them as were so constituted as to be miserable and rebellious would"
"x35","die; and, in the end, the balance being permanent, the survivors would"
"x35","become as well adapted to the conditions of underground life, and as"
"x35","happy in their way, as the Overworld people were to theirs. As it"
"x35","seemed to me, the refined beauty and the etiolated pallor followed"
"x35","naturally enough."
"x35",""
"x35","“The great triumph of Humanity I had dreamed of took a different shape"
"x35","in my mind. It had been no such triumph of moral education and general"
"x35","co-operation as I had imagined. Instead, I saw a real aristocracy,"
"x35","armed with a perfected science and working to a logical conclusion the"
"x35","industrial system of today. Its triumph had not been simply a triumph"
"x35","over Nature, but a triumph over Nature and the fellow-man. This, I must"
"x35","warn you, was my theory at the time. I had no convenient cicerone in"
"x35","the pattern of the Utopian books. My explanation may be absolutely"
"x35","wrong. I still think it is the most plausible one. But even on this"
"x35","supposition the balanced civilisation that was at last attained must"
"x35","have long since passed its zenith, and was now far fallen into decay."
"x35","The too-perfect security of the Overworlders had led them to a slow"
"x35","movement of degeneration, to a general dwindling in size, strength, and"
"x35","intelligence. That I could see clearly enough already. What had"
"x35","happened to the Undergrounders I did not yet suspect; but, from what I"
"x35","had seen of the Morlocks—that, by the bye, was the name by which these"
"x35","creatures were called—I could imagine that the modification of the"
"x35","human type was even far more profound than among the ‘Eloi,’ the"
"x35","beautiful race that I already knew."
"x35",""
"x35","“Then came troublesome doubts. Why had the Morlocks taken my Time"
"x35","Machine? For I felt sure it was they who had taken it. Why, too, if the"
"x35","Eloi were masters, could they not restore the machine to me? And why"
"x35","were they so terribly afraid of the dark? I proceeded, as I have said,"
"x35","to question Weena about this Underworld, but here again I was"
"x35","disappointed. At first she would not understand my questions, and"
"x35","presently she refused to answer them. She shivered as though the topic"
"x35","was unendurable. And when I pressed her, perhaps a little harshly, she"
"x35","burst into tears. They were the only tears, except my own, I ever saw"
"x35","in that Golden Age. When I saw them I ceased abruptly to trouble about"
"x35","the Morlocks, and was only concerned in banishing these signs of her"
"x35","human inheritance from Weena’s eyes. And very soon she was smiling and"
"x35","clapping her hands, while I solemnly burnt a match."

"x35","the new-found clue in what was manifestly the proper way. I felt a"
"x35","peculiar shrinking from those pallid bodies. They were just the"
"x35","half-bleached colour of the worms and things one sees preserved in"
"x35","spirit in a zoological museum. And they were filthily cold to the"

"x35","“The next night I did not sleep well. Probably my health was a little"
"x35","disordered. I was oppressed with perplexity and doubt. Once or twice I"
"x35","had a feeling of intense fear for which I could perceive no definite"
"x35","reason. I remember creeping noiselessly into the great hall where the"
"x35","little people were sleeping in the moonlight—that night Weena was among"
"x35","them—and feeling reassured by their presence. It occurred to me even"
"x35","then, that in the course of a few days the moon must pass through its"
"x35","last quarter, and the nights grow dark, when the appearances of these"
"x35","unpleasant creatures from below, these whitened Lemurs, this new vermin"
"x35","that had replaced the old, might be more abundant. And on both these"
"x35","days I had the restless feeling of one who shirks an inevitable duty. I"
"x35","felt assured that the Time Machine was only to be recovered by boldly"
"x35","penetrating these mysteries of underground. Yet I could not face the"
"x35","mystery. If only I had had a companion it would have been different."
"x35","But I was so horribly alone, and even to clamber down into the darkness"
"x35","of the well appalled me. I don’t know if you will understand my"
"x35","feeling, but I never felt quite safe at my back."
"x35",""
"x35","“It was this restlessness, this insecurity, perhaps, that drove me"
"x35","farther and farther afield in my exploring expeditions. Going to the"
"x35","south-westward towards the rising country that is now called Combe"
"x35","Wood, I observed far-off, in the direction of nineteenth-century"
"x35","Banstead, a vast green structure, different in character from any I had"
"x35","hitherto seen. It was larger than the largest of the palaces or ruins I"
"x35","knew, and the façade had an Oriental look: the face of it having the"
"x35","lustre, as well as the pale-green tint, a kind of bluish-green, of a"
"x35","certain type of Chinese porcelain. This difference in aspect suggested"
"x35","a difference in use, and I was minded to push on and explore. But the"
"x35","day was growing late, and I had come upon the sight of the place after"
"x35","a long and tiring circuit; so I resolved to hold over the adventure for"
"x35","the following day, and I returned to the welcome and the caresses of"
"x35","little Weena. But next morning I perceived clearly enough that my"
"x35","curiosity regarding the Palace of Green Porcelain was a piece of"
"x35","self-deception, to enable me to shirk, by another day, an experience I"
"x35","dreaded. I resolved I would make the descent without further waste of"
"x35","time, and started out in the early morning towards a well near the"
"x35","ruins of granite and aluminium."
"x35",""
"x35","“Little Weena ran with me. She danced beside me to the well, but when"
"x35","she saw me lean over the mouth and look downward, she seemed strangely"
"x35","disconcerted. ‘Good-bye, little Weena,’ I said, kissing her; and then"
"x35","putting her down, I began to feel over the parapet for the climbing"
"x35","hooks. Rather hastily, I may as well confess, for I feared my courage"
"x35","might leak away! At first she watched me in amazement. Then she gave a"
"x35","most piteous cry, and running to me, she began to pull at me with her"
"x35","little hands. I think her opposition nerved me rather to proceed. I"
"x35","shook her off, perhaps a little roughly, and in another moment I was in"
"x35","the throat of the well. I saw her agonised face over the parapet, and"
"x35","smiled to reassure her. Then I had to look down at the unstable hooks"
"x35","to which I clung."
"x35",""
"x35","“I had to clamber down a shaft of perhaps two hundred yards. The"
"x35","descent was effected by means of metallic bars projecting from the"
"x35","sides of the well, and these being adapted to the needs of a creature"
"x35","much smaller and lighter than myself, I was speedily cramped and"
"x35","fatigued by the descent. And not simply fatigued! One of the bars bent"
"x35","suddenly under my weight, and almost swung me off into the blackness"
"x35","beneath. For a moment I hung by one hand, and after that experience I"
"x35","did not dare to rest again. Though my arms and back were presently"
"x35","acutely painful, I went on clambering down the sheer descent with as"
"x35","quick a motion as possible. Glancing upward, I saw the aperture, a"
"x35","small blue disc, in which a star was visible, while little Weena’s head"
"x35","showed as a round black projection. The thudding sound of a machine"
"x35","below grew louder and more oppressive. Everything save that little disc"
"x35","above was profoundly dark, and when I looked up again Weena had"
"x35","disappeared."
"x35",""
"x35","“I was in an agony of discomfort. I had some thought of trying to go up"
"x35","the shaft again, and leave the Underworld alone. But even while I"
"x35","turned this over in my mind I continued to descend. At last, with"
"x35","intense relief, I saw dimly coming up, a foot to the right of me, a"
"x35","slender loophole in the wall. Swinging myself in, I found it was the"
"x35","aperture of a narrow horizontal tunnel in which I could lie down and"
"x35","rest. It was not too soon. My arms ached, my back was cramped, and I"
"x35","was trembling with the prolonged terror of a fall. Besides this, the"
"x35","unbroken darkness had had a distressing effect upon my eyes. The air"
"x35","was full of the throb and hum of machinery pumping air down the shaft."
"x35",""
"x35","“I do not know how long I lay. I was arroused by a soft hand touching"
"x35","my face. Starting up in the darkness I snatched at my matches and,"
"x35","hastily striking one, I saw three stooping white creatures similar to"
"x35","the one I had seen above ground in the ruin, hastily retreating before"
"x35","the light. Living, as they did, in what appeared to me impenetrable"
"x35","darkness, their eyes were abnormally large and sensitive, just as are"
"x35","the pupils of the abysmal fishes, and they reflected the light in the"
"x35","same way. I have no doubt they could see me in that rayless obscurity,"
"x35","and they did not seem to have any fear of me apart from the light. But,"
"x35","so soon as I struck a match in order to see them, they fled"
"x35","incontinently, vanishing into dark gutters and tunnels, from which"
"x35","their eyes glared at me in the strangest fashion."
"x35",""
"x35","“I tried to call to them, but the language they had was apparently"
"x35","different from that of the Overworld people; so that I was needs left"
"x35","to my own unaided efforts, and the thought of flight before exploration"
"x35","was even then in my mind. But I said to myself, ‘You are in for it"
"x35","now,’ and, feeling my way along the tunnel, I found the noise of"
"x35","machinery grow louder. Presently the walls fell away from me, and I"
"x35","came to a large open space, and striking another match, saw that I had"
"x35","entered a vast arched cavern, which stretched into utter darkness"
"x35","beyond the range of my light. The view I had of it was as much as one"
"x35","could see in the burning of a match."
"x35",""
"x35","“Necessarily my memory is vague. Great shapes like big machines rose"
"x35","out of the dimness, and cast grotesque black shadows, in which dim"
"x35","spectral Morlocks sheltered from the glare. The place, by the bye, was"
"x35","very stuffy and oppressive, and the faint halitus of freshly-shed blood"
"x35","was in the air. Some way down the central vista was a little table of"
"x35","white metal, laid with what seemed a meal. The Morlocks at any rate"
"x35","were carnivorous! Even at the time, I remember wondering what large"
"x35","animal could have survived to furnish the red joint I saw. It was all"
"x35","very indistinct: the heavy smell, the big unmeaning shapes, the obscene"
"x35","figures lurking in the shadows, and only waiting for the darkness to"
"x35","come at me again! Then the match burnt down, and stung my fingers, and"
"x35","fell, a wriggling red spot in the blackness."
"x35",""
"x35","“I have thought since how particularly ill-equipped I was for such an"
"x35","experience. When I had started with the Time Machine, I had started"
"x35","with the absurd assumption that the men of the Future would certainly"
"x35","be infinitely ahead of ourselves in all their appliances. I had come"
"x35","without arms, without medicine, without anything to smoke—at times I"
"x35","missed tobacco frightfully!—even without enough matches. If only I had"
"x35","thought of a Kodak! I could have flashed that glimpse of the Underworld"
"x35","in a second, and examined it at leisure. But, as it was, I stood there"
"x35","with only the weapons and the powers that Nature had endowed me"
"x35","with—hands, feet, and teeth; these, and four safety-matches that still"
"x35","remained to me."
"x35",""
"x35","“I was afraid to push my way in among all this machinery in the dark,"
"x35","and it was only with my last glimpse of light I discovered that my"
"x35","store of matches had run low. It had never occurred to me until that"
"x35","moment that there was any need to economise them, and I had wasted"
"x35","almost half the box in astonishing the Overworlders, to whom fire was a"
"x35","novelty. Now, as I say, I had four left, and while I stood in the dark,"
"x35","a hand touched mine, lank fingers came feeling over my face, and I was"
"x35","sensible of a peculiar unpleasant odour. I fancied I heard the"
"x35","breathing of a crowd of those dreadful little beings about me. I felt"
"x35","the box of matches in my hand being gently disengaged, and other hands"
"x35","behind me plucking at my clothing. The sense of these unseen creatures"
"x35","examining me was indescribably unpleasant. The sudden realisation of my"
"x35","ignorance of their ways of thinking and doing came home to me very"
"x35","vividly in the darkness. I shouted at them as loudly as I could. They"
"x35","started away, and then I could feel them approaching me again. They"
"x35","clutched at me more boldly, whispering odd sounds to each other. I"
"x35","shivered violently, and shouted again—rather discordantly. This time"
"x35","they were not so seriously alarmed, and they made a queer laughing"
"x35","noise as they came back at me. I will confess I was horribly"
"x35","frightened. I determined to strike another match and escape under the"
"x35","protection of its glare. I did so, and eking out the flicker with a"
"x35","scrap of paper from my pocket, I made good my retreat to the narrow"
"x35","tunnel. But I had scarce entered this when my light was blown out and"
"x35","in the blackness I could hear the Morlocks rustling like wind among"
"x35","leaves, and pattering like the rain, as they hurried after me."
"x35",""
"x35","“In a moment I was clutched by several hands, and there was no"
"x35","mistaking that they were trying to haul me back. I struck another"
"x35","light, and waved it in their dazzled faces. You can scarce imagine how"
"x35","nauseatingly inhuman they looked—those pale, chinless faces and great,"
"x35","lidless, pinkish-grey eyes!—as they stared in their blindness and"
"x35","bewilderment. But I did not stay to look, I promise you: I retreated"
"x35","again, and when my second match had ended, I struck my third. It had"
"x35","almost burnt through when I reached the opening into the shaft. I lay"
"x35","down on the edge, for the throb of the great pump below made me giddy."
"x35","Then I felt sideways for the projecting hooks, and, as I did so, my"
"x35","feet were grasped from behind, and I was violently tugged backward. I"
"x35","lit my last match … and it incontinently went out. But I had my hand on"
"x35","the climbing bars now, and, kicking violently, I disengaged myself from"
"x35","the clutches of the Morlocks, and was speedily clambering up the shaft,"
"x35","while they stayed peering and blinking up at me: all but one little"
"x35","wretch who followed me for some way, and well-nigh secured my boot as a"
"x35","trophy."
"x35",""
"x35","“That climb seemed interminable to me. With the last twenty or thirty"
"x35","feet of it a deadly nausea came upon me. I had the greatest difficulty"
"x35","in keeping my hold. The last few yards was a frightful struggle against"
"x35","this faintness. Several times my head swam, and I felt all the"
"x35","sensations of falling. At last, however, I got over the well-mouth"
"x35","somehow, and staggered out of the ruin into the blinding sunlight. I"
"x35","fell upon my face. Even the soil smelt sweet and clean. Then I remember"

"x35","the little Upperworld people for the dark. I wondered vaguely what foul"
"x35","villainy it might be that the Morlocks did under the new moon. I felt"
"x35","pretty sure now that my second hypothesis was all wrong. The Upperworld"
"x35","people might once have been the favoured aristocracy, and the Morlocks"
"x35","their mechanical servants: but that had long since passed away. The two"
"x35","species that had resulted from the evolution of man were sliding down"
"x35","towards, or had already arrived at, an altogether new relationship. The"
"x35","Eloi, like the Carlovignan kings, had decayed to a mere beautiful"
"x35","futility. They still possessed the earth on sufferance: since the"
"x35","Morlocks, subterranean for innumerable generations, had come at last to"
"x35","find the daylit surface intolerable. And the Morlocks made their"
"x35","garments, I inferred, and maintained them in their habitual needs,"
"x35","perhaps through the survival of an old habit of service. They did it as"
"x35","a standing horse paws with his foot, or as a man enjoys killing animals"
"x35","in sport: because ancient and departed necessities had impressed it on"
"x35","the organism. But, clearly, the old order was already in part reversed."
"x35","The Nemesis of the delicate ones was creeping on apace. Ages ago,"
"x35","thousands of generations ago, man had thrust his brother man out of the"
"x35","ease and the sunshine. And now that brother was coming back—changed!"
"x35","Already the Eloi had begun to learn one old lesson anew. They were"
"x35","becoming reacquainted with Fear. And suddenly there came into my head"
"x35","the memory of the meat I had seen in the Underworld. It seemed odd how"
"x35","it floated into my mind: not stirred up as it were by the current of my"
"x35","meditations, but coming in almost like a question from outside. I tried"

"x35","Without further delay I determined to make myself arms and a fastness"

"x35","the heel of one of my shoes was loose, and a nail was working through"
"x35","the sole—they were comfortable old shoes I wore about indoors—so that I"
"x35","was lame. And it was already long past sunset when I came in sight of"
"x35","the palace, silhouetted black against the pale yellow of the sky."

"x35","“Weena had been hugely delighted when I began to carry her, but after a"
"x35","while she desired me to let her down, and ran along by the side of me,"
"x35","occasionally darting off on either hand to pick flowers to stick in my"
"x35","pockets. My pockets had always puzzled Weena, but at the last she had"
"x35","concluded that they were an eccentric kind of vases for floral"
"x35","decoration. At least she utilised them for that purpose. And that"
"x35","reminds me! In changing my jacket I found…”"

"x35","_The Time Traveller paused, put his hand into his pocket, and silently"

"x35",""
"x35","“As the hush of evening crept over the world and we proceeded over the"
"x35","hill crest towards Wimbledon, Weena grew tired and wanted to return to"
"x35","the house of grey stone. But I pointed out the distant pinnacles of the"
"x35","Palace of Green Porcelain to her, and contrived to make her understand"
"x35","that we were seeking a refuge there from her Fear. You know that great"
"x35","pause that comes upon things before the dusk? Even the breeze stops in"
"x35","the trees. To me there is always an air of expectation about that"
"x35","evening stillness. The sky was clear, remote, and empty save for a few"
"x35","horizontal bars far down in the sunset. Well, that night the"
"x35","expectation took the colour of my fears. In that darkling calm my"
"x35","senses seemed preternaturally sharpened. I fancied I could even feel"
"x35","the hollowness of the ground beneath my feet: could, indeed, almost see"
"x35","through it the Morlocks on their ant-hill going hither and thither and"
"x35","waiting for the dark. In my excitement I fancied that they would"
"x35","receive my invasion of their burrows as a declaration of war. And why"
"x35","had they taken my Time Machine?"
"x35",""
"x35","“So we went on in the quiet, and the twilight deepened into night. The"
"x35","clear blue of the distance faded, and one star after another came out."
"x35","The ground grew dim and the trees black. Weena’s fears and her fatigue"
"x35","grew upon her. I took her in my arms and talked to her and caressed"
"x35","her. Then, as the darkness grew deeper, she put her arms round my neck,"
"x35","and, closing her eyes, tightly pressed her face against my shoulder. So"
"x35","we went down a long slope into a valley, and there in the dimness I"
"x35","almost walked into a little river. This I waded, and went up the"
"x35","opposite side of the valley, past a number of sleeping houses, and by a"
"x35","statue—a Faun, or some such figure, _minus_ the head. Here too were"
"x35","acacias. So far I had seen nothing of the Morlocks, but it was yet"
"x35","early in the night, and the darker hours before the old moon rose were"
"x35","still to come."
"x35",""
"x35","“From the brow of the next hill I saw a thick wood spreading wide and"
"x35","black before me. I hesitated at this. I could see no end to it, either"
"x35","to the right or the left. Feeling tired—my feet, in particular, were"
"x35","very sore—I carefully lowered Weena from my shoulder as I halted, and"
"x35","sat down upon the turf. I could no longer see the Palace of Green"
"x35","Porcelain, and I was in doubt of my direction. I looked into the"
"x35","thickness of the wood and thought of what it might hide. Under that"
"x35","dense tangle of branches one would be out of sight of the stars. Even"
"x35","were there no other lurking danger—a danger I did not care to let my"
"x35","imagination loose upon—there would still be all the roots to stumble"
"x35","over and the tree-boles to strike against. I was very tired, too, after"
"x35","the excitements of the day; so I decided that I would not face it, but"
"x35","would pass the night upon the open hill."
"x35",""
"x35","“Weena, I was glad to find, was fast asleep. I carefully wrapped her in"
"x35","my jacket, and sat down beside her to wait for the moonrise. The"
"x35","hillside was quiet and deserted, but from the black of the wood there"
"x35","came now and then a stir of living things. Above me shone the stars,"
"x35","for the night was very clear. I felt a certain sense of friendly"
"x35","comfort in their twinkling. All the old constellations had gone from"
"x35","the sky, however: that slow movement which is imperceptible in a"
"x35","hundred human lifetimes, had long since rearranged them in unfamiliar"
"x35","groupings. But the Milky Way, it seemed to me, was still the same"
"x35","tattered streamer of star-dust as of yore. Southward (as I judged it)"
"x35","was a very bright red star that was new to me; it was even more"
"x35","splendid than our own green Sirius. And amid all these scintillating"
"x35","points of light one bright planet shone kindly and steadily like the"
"x35","face of an old friend."
"x35",""
"x35","“Looking at these stars suddenly dwarfed my own troubles and all the"
"x35","gravities of terrestrial life. I thought of their unfathomable"
"x35","distance, and the slow inevitable drift of their movements out of the"
"x35","unknown past into the unknown future. I thought of the great"
"x35","precessional cycle that the pole of the earth describes. Only forty"
"x35","times had that silent revolution occurred during all the years that I"
"x35","had traversed. And during these few revolutions all the activity, all"
"x35","the traditions, the complex organisations, the nations, languages,"
"x35","literatures, aspirations, even the mere memory of Man as I knew him,"
"x35","had been swept out of existence. Instead were these frail creatures who"
"x35","had forgotten their high ancestry, and the white Things of which I went"
"x35","in terror. Then I thought of the Great Fear that was between the two"
"x35","species, and for the first time, with a sudden shiver, came the clear"
"x35","knowledge of what the meat I had seen might be. Yet it was too"
"x35","horrible! I looked at little Weena sleeping beside me, her face white"
"x35","and starlike under the stars, and forthwith dismissed the thought."
"x35",""
"x35","“Through that long night I held my mind off the Morlocks as well as I"
"x35","could, and whiled away the time by trying to fancy I could find signs"
"x35","of the old constellations in the new confusion. The sky kept very"
"x35","clear, except for a hazy cloud or so. No doubt I dozed at times. Then,"
"x35","as my vigil wore on, came a faintness in the eastward sky, like the"
"x35","reflection of some colourless fire, and the old moon rose, thin and"
"x35","peaked and white. And close behind, and overtaking it, and overflowing"
"x35","it, the dawn came, pale at first, and then growing pink and warm. No"
"x35","Morlocks had approached us. Indeed, I had seen none upon the hill that"
"x35","night. And in the confidence of renewed day it almost seemed to me that"
"x35","my fear had been unreasonable. I stood up and found my foot with the"
"x35","loose heel swollen at the ankle and painful under the heel; so I sat"
"x35","down again, took off my shoes, and flung them away."
"x35",""
"x35","“I awakened Weena, and we went down into the wood, now green and"
"x35","pleasant instead of black and forbidding. We found some fruit wherewith"
"x35","to break our fast. We soon met others of the dainty ones, laughing and"
"x35","dancing in the sunlight as though there was no such thing in nature as"
"x35","the night. And then I thought once more of the meat that I had seen. I"
"x35","felt assured now of what it was, and from the bottom of my heart I"
"x35","pitied this last feeble rill from the great flood of humanity. Clearly,"
"x35","at some time in the Long-Ago of human decay the Morlocks’ food had run"
"x35","short. Possibly they had lived on rats and such-like vermin. Even now"
"x35","man is far less discriminating and exclusive in his food than he"
"x35","was—far less than any monkey. His prejudice against human flesh is no"
"x35","deep-seated instinct. And so these inhuman sons of men——! I tried to"
"x35","look at the thing in a scientific spirit. After all, they were less"
"x35","human and more remote than our cannibal ancestors of three or four"
"x35","thousand years ago. And the intelligence that would have made this"
"x35","state of things a torment had gone. Why should I trouble myself? These"
"x35","Eloi were mere fatted cattle, which the ant-like Morlocks preserved and"
"x35","preyed upon—probably saw to the breeding of. And there was Weena"
"x35","dancing at my side!"
"x35",""
"x35","“Then I tried to preserve myself from the horror that was coming upon"
"x35","me, by regarding it as a rigorous punishment of human selfishness. Man"
"x35","had been content to live in ease and delight upon the labours of his"
"x35","fellow-man, had taken Necessity as his watchword and excuse, and in the"
"x35","fullness of time Necessity had come home to him. I even tried a"
"x35","Carlyle-like scorn of this wretched aristocracy in decay. But this"
"x35","attitude of mind was impossible. However great their intellectual"
"x35","degradation, the Eloi had kept too much of the human form not to claim"
"x35","my sympathy, and to make me perforce a sharer in their degradation and"
"x35","their Fear."
"x35",""
"x35","“I had at that time very vague ideas as to the course I should pursue."
"x35","My first was to secure some safe place of refuge, and to make myself"
"x35","such arms of metal or stone as I could contrive. That necessity was"
"x35","immediate. In the next place, I hoped to procure some means of fire, so"
"x35","that I should have the weapon of a torch at hand, for nothing, I knew,"
"x35","would be more efficient against these Morlocks. Then I wanted to"
"x35","arrange some contrivance to break open the doors of bronze under the"
"x35","White Sphinx. I had in mind a battering ram. I had a persuasion that if"
"x35","I could enter those doors and carry a blaze of light before me I should"
"x35","discover the Time Machine and escape. I could not imagine the Morlocks"
"x35","were strong enough to move it far away. Weena I had resolved to bring"
"x35","with me to our own time. And turning such schemes over in my mind I"
"x35","pursued our way towards the building which my fancy had chosen as our"

"x35"," The Palace of Green Porcelain"
"x35",""
"x35",""
"x35","“I found the Palace of Green Porcelain, when we approached it about"
"x35","noon, deserted and falling into ruin. Only ragged vestiges of glass"
"x35","remained in its windows, and great sheets of the green facing had"
"x35","fallen away from the corroded metallic framework. It lay very high upon"
"x35","a turfy down, and looking north-eastward before I entered it, I was"
"x35","surprised to see a large estuary, or even creek, where I judged"
"x35","Wandsworth and Battersea must once have been. I thought then—though I"
"x35","never followed up the thought—of what might have happened, or might be"
"x35","happening, to the living things in the sea."
"x35",""
"x35","“The material of the Palace proved on examination to be indeed"
"x35","porcelain, and along the face of it I saw an inscription in some"
"x35","unknown character. I thought, rather foolishly, that Weena might help"
"x35","me to interpret this, but I only learnt that the bare idea of writing"
"x35","had never entered her head. She always seemed to me, I fancy, more"
"x35","human than she was, perhaps because her affection was so human."
"x35",""
"x35","“Within the big valves of the door—which were open and broken—we found,"
"x35","instead of the customary hall, a long gallery lit by many side windows."
"x35","At the first glance I was reminded of a museum. The tiled floor was"
"x35","thick with dust, and a remarkable array of miscellaneous objects was"
"x35","shrouded in the same grey covering. Then I perceived, standing strange"
"x35","and gaunt in the centre of the hall, what was clearly the lower part of"
"x35","a huge skeleton. I recognised by the oblique feet that it was some"
"x35","extinct creature after the fashion of the Megatherium. The skull and"
"x35","the upper bones lay beside it in the thick dust, and in one place,"
"x35","where rain-water had dropped through a leak in the roof, the thing"
"x35","itself had been worn away. Further in the gallery was the huge skeleton"
"x35","barrel of a Brontosaurus. My museum hypothesis was confirmed. Going"
"x35","towards the side I found what appeared to be sloping shelves, and"
"x35","clearing away the thick dust, I found the old familiar glass cases of"
"x35","our own time. But they must have been air-tight to judge from the fair"
"x35","preservation of some of their contents."
"x35",""
"x35","“Clearly we stood among the ruins of some latter-day South Kensington!"
"x35","Here, apparently, was the Palæontological Section, and a very splendid"
"x35","array of fossils it must have been, though the inevitable process of"
"x35","decay that had been staved off for a time, and had, through the"
"x35","extinction of bacteria and fungi, lost ninety-nine hundredths of its"
"x35","force, was nevertheless, with extreme sureness if with extreme slowness"
"x35","at work again upon all its treasures. Here and there I found traces of"
"x35","the little people in the shape of rare fossils broken to pieces or"
"x35","threaded in strings upon reeds. And the cases had in some instances"
"x35","been bodily removed—by the Morlocks, as I judged. The place was very"
"x35","silent. The thick dust deadened our footsteps. Weena, who had been"
"x35","rolling a sea urchin down the sloping glass of a case, presently came,"
"x35","as I stared about me, and very quietly took my hand and stood beside"
"x35","me."
"x35",""
"x35","“And at first I was so much surprised by this ancient monument of an"
"x35","intellectual age that I gave no thought to the possibilities it"
"x35","presented. Even my preoccupation about the Time Machine receded a"
"x35","little from my mind."
"x35",""
"x35","“To judge from the size of the place, this Palace of Green Porcelain"
"x35","had a great deal more in it than a Gallery of Palæontology; possibly"
"x35","historical galleries; it might be, even a library! To me, at least in"
"x35","my present circumstances, these would be vastly more interesting than"
"x35","this spectacle of old-time geology in decay. Exploring, I found another"
"x35","short gallery running transversely to the first. This appeared to be"
"x35","devoted to minerals, and the sight of a block of sulphur set my mind"
"x35","running on gunpowder. But I could find no saltpetre; indeed, no"
"x35","nitrates of any kind. Doubtless they had deliquesced ages ago. Yet the"
"x35","sulphur hung in my mind, and set up a train of thinking. As for the"
"x35","rest of the contents of that gallery, though on the whole they were the"
"x35","best preserved of all I saw, I had little interest. I am no specialist"
"x35","in mineralogy, and I went on down a very ruinous aisle running parallel"
"x35","to the first hall I had entered. Apparently this section had been"
"x35","devoted to natural history, but everything had long since passed out of"
"x35","recognition. A few shrivelled and blackened vestiges of what had once"
"x35","been stuffed animals, desiccated mummies in jars that had once held"
"x35","spirit, a brown dust of departed plants: that was all! I was sorry for"
"x35","that, because I should have been glad to trace the patient"
"x35","readjustments by which the conquest of animated nature had been"
"x35","attained. Then we came to a gallery of simply colossal proportions, but"
"x35","singularly ill-lit, the floor of it running downward at a slight angle"
"x35","from the end at which I entered. At intervals white globes hung from"
"x35","the ceiling—many of them cracked and smashed—which suggested that"
"x35","originally the place had been artificially lit. Here I was more in my"
"x35","element, for rising on either side of me were the huge bulks of big"
"x35","machines, all greatly corroded and many broken down, but some still"
"x35","fairly complete. You know I have a certain weakness for mechanism, and"
"x35","I was inclined to linger among these; the more so as for the most part"
"x35","they had the interest of puzzles, and I could make only the vaguest"
"x35","guesses at what they were for. I fancied that if I could solve their"
"x35","puzzles I should find myself in possession of powers that might be of"
"x35","use against the Morlocks."
"x35",""
"x35","“Suddenly Weena came very close to my side. So suddenly that she"
"x35","startled me. Had it not been for her I do not think I should have"
"x35","noticed that the floor of the gallery sloped at all. [Footnote: It may"
"x35","be, of course, that the floor did not slope, but that the museum was"
"x35","built into the side of a hill.—ED.] The end I had come in at was quite"
"x35","above ground, and was lit by rare slit-like windows. As you went down"
"x35","the length, the ground came up against these windows, until at last"
"x35","there was a pit like the ‘area‘ of a London house before each, and only"
"x35","a narrow line of daylight at the top. I went slowly along, puzzling"
"x35","about the machines, and had been too intent upon them to notice the"
"x35","gradual diminution of the light, until Weena’s increasing apprehensions"
"x35","drew my attention. Then I saw that the gallery ran down at last into a"
"x35","thick darkness. I hesitated, and then, as I looked round me, I saw that"
"x35","the dust was less abundant and its surface less even. Further away"
"x35","towards the dimness, it appeared to be broken by a number of small"
"x35","narrow footprints. My sense of the immediate presence of the Morlocks"
"x35","revived at that. I felt that I was wasting my time in the academic"
"x35","examination of machinery. I called to mind that it was already far"
"x35","advanced in the afternoon, and that I had still no weapon, no refuge,"
"x35","and no means of making a fire. And then down in the remote blackness of"
"x35","the gallery I heard a peculiar pattering, and the same odd noises I had"
"x35","heard down the well."
"x35",""
"x35","“I took Weena’s hand. Then, struck with a sudden idea, I left her and"
"x35","turned to a machine from which projected a lever not unlike those in a"
"x35","signal-box. Clambering upon the stand, and grasping this lever in my"
"x35","hands, I put all my weight upon it sideways. Suddenly Weena, deserted"
"x35","in the central aisle, began to whimper. I had judged the strength of"
"x35","the lever pretty correctly, for it snapped after a minute’s strain, and"
"x35","I rejoined her with a mace in my hand more than sufficient, I judged,"
"x35","for any Morlock skull I might encounter. And I longed very much to kill"
"x35","a Morlock or so. Very inhuman, you may think, to want to go killing"
"x35","one’s own descendants! But it was impossible, somehow, to feel any"
"x35","humanity in the things. Only my disinclination to leave Weena, and a"
"x35","persuasion that if I began to slake my thirst for murder my Time"
"x35","Machine might suffer, restrained me from going straight down the"
"x35","gallery and killing the brutes I heard."
"x35",""
"x35","“Well, mace in one hand and Weena in the other, I went out of that"
"x35","gallery and into another and still larger one, which at the first"
"x35","glance reminded me of a military chapel hung with tattered flags. The"
"x35","brown and charred rags that hung from the sides of it, I presently"
"x35","recognised as the decaying vestiges of books. They had long since"
"x35","dropped to pieces, and every semblance of print had left them. But here"
"x35","and there were warped boards and cracked metallic clasps that told the"
"x35","tale well enough. Had I been a literary man I might, perhaps, have"
"x35","moralised upon the futility of all ambition. But as it was, the thing"
"x35","that struck me with keenest force was the enormous waste of labour to"
"x35","which this sombre wilderness of rotting paper testified. At the time I"
"x35","will confess that I thought chiefly of the _Philosophical Transactions_"
"x35","and my own seventeen papers upon physical optics."
"x35",""
"x35","“Then, going up a broad staircase, we came to what may once have been a"
"x35","gallery of technical chemistry. And here I had not a little hope of"
"x35","useful discoveries. Except at one end where the roof had collapsed,"
"x35","this gallery was well preserved. I went eagerly to every unbroken case."
"x35","And at last, in one of the really air-tight cases, I found a box of"
"x35","matches. Very eagerly I tried them. They were perfectly good. They were"
"x35","not even damp. I turned to Weena. ‘Dance,’ I cried to her in her own"
"x35","tongue. For now I had a weapon indeed against the horrible creatures we"
"x35","feared. And so, in that derelict museum, upon the thick soft carpeting"
"x35","of dust, to Weena’s huge delight, I solemnly performed a kind of"
"x35","composite dance, whistling _The Land of the Leal_ as cheerfully as I"
"x35","could. In part it was a modest _cancan_, in part a step dance, in part"
"x35","a skirt dance (so far as my tail-coat permitted), and in part original."
"x35","For I am naturally inventive, as you know."
"x35",""
"x35","“Now, I still think that for this box of matches to have escaped the"
"x35","wear of time for immemorial years was a most strange, as for me it was"
"x35","a most fortunate, thing. Yet, oddly enough, I found a far unlikelier"
"x35","substance, and that was camphor. I found it in a sealed jar, that by"
"x35","chance, I suppose, had been really hermetically sealed. I fancied at"
"x35","first that it was paraffin wax, and smashed the glass accordingly. But"
"x35","the odour of camphor was unmistakable. In the universal decay this"
"x35","volatile substance had chanced to survive, perhaps through many"
"x35","thousands of centuries. It reminded me of a sepia painting I had once"
"x35","seen done from the ink of a fossil Belemnite that must have perished"
"x35","and become fossilised millions of years ago. I was about to throw it"
"x35","away, but I remembered that it was inflammable and burnt with a good"
"x35","bright flame—was, in fact, an excellent candle—and I put it in my"
"x35","pocket. I found no explosives, however, nor any means of breaking down"
"x35","the bronze doors. As yet my iron crowbar was the most helpful thing I"
"x35","had chanced upon. Nevertheless I left that gallery greatly elated."
"x35",""
"x35","“I cannot tell you all the story of that long afternoon. It would"
"x35","require a great effort of memory to recall my explorations in at all"
"x35","the proper order. I remember a long gallery of rusting stands of arms,"
"x35","and how I hesitated between my crowbar and a hatchet or a sword. I"
"x35","could not carry both, however, and my bar of iron promised best against"
"x35","the bronze gates. There were numbers of guns, pistols, and rifles. The"
"x35","most were masses of rust, but many were of some new metal, and still"
"x35","fairly sound. But any cartridges or powder there may once have been had"
"x35","rotted into dust. One corner I saw was charred and shattered; perhaps,"
"x35","I thought, by an explosion among the specimens. In another place was a"
"x35","vast array of idols—Polynesian, Mexican, Grecian, Phœnician, every"
"x35","country on earth, I should think. And here, yielding to an irresistible"
"x35","impulse, I wrote my name upon the nose of a steatite monster from South"
"x35","America that particularly took my fancy."
"x35",""
"x35","“As the evening drew on, my interest waned. I went through gallery"
"x35","after gallery, dusty, silent, often ruinous, the exhibits sometimes"
"x35","mere heaps of rust and lignite, sometimes fresher. In one place I"
"x35","suddenly found myself near the model of a tin mine, and then by the"
"x35","merest accident I discovered, in an air-tight case, two dynamite"
"x35","cartridges! I shouted ‘Eureka!’ and smashed the case with joy. Then"
"x35","came a doubt. I hesitated. Then, selecting a little side gallery, I"
"x35","made my essay. I never felt such a disappointment as I did in waiting"
"x35","five, ten, fifteen minutes for an explosion that never came. Of course"
"x35","the things were dummies, as I might have guessed from their presence. I"
"x35","really believe that had they not been so, I should have rushed off"
"x35","incontinently and blown Sphinx, bronze doors, and (as it proved) my"
"x35","chances of finding the Time Machine, all together into non-existence."
"x35",""
"x35","“It was after that, I think, that we came to a little open court within"
"x35","the palace. It was turfed, and had three fruit-trees. So we rested and"
"x35","refreshed ourselves. Towards sunset I began to consider our position."
"x35","Night was creeping upon us, and my inaccessible hiding-place had still"
"x35","to be found. But that troubled me very little now. I had in my"
"x35","possession a thing that was, perhaps, the best of all defences against"
"x35","the Morlocks—I had matches! I had the camphor in my pocket, too, if a"
"x35","blaze were needed. It seemed to me that the best thing we could do"
"x35","would be to pass the night in the open, protected by a fire. In the"
"x35","morning there was the getting of the Time Machine. Towards that, as"
"x35","yet, I had only my iron mace. But now, with my growing knowledge, I"
"x35","felt very differently towards those bronze doors. Up to this, I had"
"x35","refrained from forcing them, largely because of the mystery on the"
"x35","other side. They had never impressed me as being very strong, and I"
"x35","hoped to find my bar of iron not altogether inadequate for the work."

"x35","morning, and ere the dusk I purposed pushing through the woods that had"
"x35","stopped me on the previous journey. My plan was to go as far as"
"x35","possible that night, and then, building a fire, to sleep in the"
"x35","protection of its glare. Accordingly, as we went along I gathered any"
"x35","sticks or dried grass I saw, and presently had my arms full of such"
"x35","litter. Thus loaded, our progress was slower than I had anticipated,"
"x35","and besides Weena was tired. And I, also, began to suffer from"
"x35","sleepiness too; so that it was full night before we reached the wood."
"x35","Upon the shrubby hill of its edge Weena would have stopped, fearing the"
"x35","darkness before us; but a singular sense of impending calamity, that"
"x35","should indeed have served me as a warning, drove me onward. I had been"
"x35","without sleep for a night and two days, and I was feverish and"
"x35","irritable. I felt sleep coming upon me, and the Morlocks with it."
"x35",""
"x35","“While we hesitated, among the black bushes behind us, and dim against"
"x35","their blackness, I saw three crouching figures. There was scrub and"
"x35","long grass all about us, and I did not feel safe from their insidious"
"x35","approach. The forest, I calculated, was rather less than a mile across."
"x35","If we could get through it to the bare hillside, there, as it seemed to"
"x35","me, was an altogether safer resting-place; I thought that with my"
"x35","matches and my camphor I could contrive to keep my path illuminated"
"x35","through the woods. Yet it was evident that if I was to flourish matches"
"x35","with my hands I should have to abandon my firewood; so, rather"
"x35","reluctantly, I put it down. And then it came into my head that I would"
"x35","amaze our friends behind by lighting it. I was to discover the"
"x35","atrocious folly of this proceeding, but it came to my mind as an"
"x35","ingenious move for covering our retreat."

"x35","“I don’t know if you have ever thought what a rare thing flame must be"
"x35","in the absence of man and in a temperate climate. The sun’s heat is"
"x35","rarely strong enough to burn, even when it is focused by dewdrops, as"
"x35","is sometimes the case in more tropical districts. Lightning may blast"
"x35","and blacken, but it rarely gives rise to widespread fire. Decaying"
"x35","vegetation may occasionally smoulder with the heat of its fermentation,"
"x35","but this rarely results in flame. In this decadence, too, the art of"
"x35","fire-making had been forgotten on the earth. The red tongues that went"
"x35","licking up my heap of wood were an altogether new and strange thing to"
"x35","Weena."
"x35",""
"x35","“She wanted to run to it and play with it. I believe she would have"
"x35","cast herself into it had I not restrained her. But I caught her up, and"
"x35","in spite of her struggles, plunged boldly before me into the wood. For"
"x35","a little way the glare of my fire lit the path. Looking back presently,"
"x35","I could see, through the crowded stems, that from my heap of sticks the"
"x35","blaze had spread to some bushes adjacent, and a curved line of fire was"
"x35","creeping up the grass of the hill. I laughed at that, and turned again"
"x35","to the dark trees before me. It was very black, and Weena clung to me"
"x35","convulsively, but there was still, as my eyes grew accustomed to the"
"x35","darkness, sufficient light for me to avoid the stems. Overhead it was"
"x35","simply black, except where a gap of remote blue sky shone down upon us"
"x35","here and there. I lit none of my matches because I had no hand free."
"x35","Upon my left arm I carried my little one, in my right hand I had my"
"x35","iron bar."
"x35",""
"x35","“For some way I heard nothing but the crackling twigs under my feet,"
"x35","the faint rustle of the breeze above, and my own breathing and the"
"x35","throb of the blood-vessels in my ears. Then I seemed to know of a"
"x35","pattering behind me. I pushed on grimly. The pattering grew more"
"x35","distinct, and then I caught the same queer sound and voices I had heard"
"x35","in the Underworld. There were evidently several of the Morlocks, and"
"x35","they were closing in upon me. Indeed, in another minute I felt a tug at"
"x35","my coat, then something at my arm. And Weena shivered violently, and"
"x35","became quite still."
"x35",""
"x35","“It was time for a match. But to get one I must put her down. I did so,"
"x35","and, as I fumbled with my pocket, a struggle began in the darkness"
"x35","about my knees, perfectly silent on her part and with the same peculiar"
"x35","cooing sounds from the Morlocks. Soft little hands, too, were creeping"
"x35","over my coat and back, touching even my neck. Then the match scratched"
"x35","and fizzed. I held it flaring, and saw the white backs of the Morlocks"
"x35","in flight amid the trees. I hastily took a lump of camphor from my"
"x35","pocket, and prepared to light it as soon as the match should wane. Then"
"x35","I looked at Weena. She was lying clutching my feet and quite"
"x35","motionless, with her face to the ground. With a sudden fright I stooped"
"x35","to her. She seemed scarcely to breathe. I lit the block of camphor and"
"x35","flung it to the ground, and as it split and flared up and drove back"
"x35","the Morlocks and the shadows, I knelt down and lifted her. The wood"
"x35","behind seemed full of the stir and murmur of a great company!"
"x35",""
"x35","“She seemed to have fainted. I put her carefully upon my shoulder and"
"x35","rose to push on, and then there came a horrible realisation. In"
"x35","manœuvring with my matches and Weena, I had turned myself about several"
"x35","times, and now I had not the faintest idea in what direction lay my"
"x35","path. For all I knew, I might be facing back towards the Palace of"
"x35","Green Porcelain. I found myself in a cold sweat. I had to think rapidly"
"x35","what to do. I determined to build a fire and encamp where we were. I"
"x35","put Weena, still motionless, down upon a turfy bole, and very hastily,"
"x35","as my first lump of camphor waned, I began collecting sticks and"
"x35","leaves. Here and there out of the darkness round me the Morlocks’ eyes"
"x35","shone like carbuncles."
"x35",""
"x35","“The camphor flickered and went out. I lit a match, and as I did so,"
"x35","two white forms that had been approaching Weena dashed hastily away."
"x35","One was so blinded by the light that he came straight for me, and I"
"x35","felt his bones grind under the blow of my fist. He gave a whoop of"
"x35","dismay, staggered a little way, and fell down. I lit another piece of"
"x35","camphor, and went on gathering my bonfire. Presently I noticed how dry"
"x35","was some of the foliage above me, for since my arrival on the Time"
"x35","Machine, a matter of a week, no rain had fallen. So, instead of casting"
"x35","about among the trees for fallen twigs, I began leaping up and dragging"
"x35","down branches. Very soon I had a choking smoky fire of green wood and"
"x35","dry sticks, and could economise my camphor. Then I turned to where"
"x35","Weena lay beside my iron mace. I tried what I could to revive her, but"
"x35","she lay like one dead. I could not even satisfy myself whether or not"
"x35","she breathed."
"x35",""
"x35","“Now, the smoke of the fire beat over towards me, and it must have made"
"x35","me heavy of a sudden. Moreover, the vapour of camphor was in the air."
"x35","My fire would not need replenishing for an hour or so. I felt very"
"x35","weary after my exertion, and sat down. The wood, too, was full of a"
"x35","slumbrous murmur that I did not understand. I seemed just to nod and"
"x35","open my eyes. But all was dark, and the Morlocks had their hands upon"
"x35","me. Flinging off their clinging fingers I hastily felt in my pocket for"
"x35","the match-box, and—it had gone! Then they gripped and closed with me"
"x35","again. In a moment I knew what had happened. I had slept, and my fire"
"x35","had gone out, and the bitterness of death came over my soul. The forest"
"x35","seemed full of the smell of burning wood. I was caught by the neck, by"
"x35","the hair, by the arms, and pulled down. It was indescribably horrible"
"x35","in the darkness to feel all these soft creatures heaped upon me. I felt"
"x35","as if I was in a monstrous spider’s web. I was overpowered, and went"
"x35","down. I felt little teeth nipping at my neck. I rolled over, and as I"
"x35","did so my hand came against my iron lever. It gave me strength. I"
"x35","struggled up, shaking the human rats from me, and, holding the bar"
"x35","short, I thrust where I judged their faces might be. I could feel the"
"x35","succulent giving of flesh and bone under my blows, and for a moment I"
"x35","was free."
"x35",""
"x35","“The strange exultation that so often seems to accompany hard fighting"
"x35","came upon me. I knew that both I and Weena were lost, but I determined"
"x35","to make the Morlocks pay for their meat. I stood with my back to a"
"x35","tree, swinging the iron bar before me. The whole wood was full of the"
"x35","stir and cries of them. A minute passed. Their voices seemed to rise to"
"x35","a higher pitch of excitement, and their movements grew faster. Yet none"
"x35","came within reach. I stood glaring at the blackness. Then suddenly came"
"x35","hope. What if the Morlocks were afraid? And close on the heels of that"
"x35","came a strange thing. The darkness seemed to grow luminous. Very dimly"
"x35","I began to see the Morlocks about me—three battered at my feet—and then"
"x35","I recognised, with incredulous surprise, that the others were running,"
"x35","in an incessant stream, as it seemed, from behind me, and away through"
"x35","the wood in front. And their backs seemed no longer white, but reddish."
"x35","As I stood agape, I saw a little red spark go drifting across a gap of"
"x35","starlight between the branches, and vanish. And at that I understood"
"x35","the smell of burning wood, the slumbrous murmur that was growing now"
"x35","into a gusty roar, the red glow, and the Morlocks’ flight."
"x35",""
"x35","“Stepping out from behind my tree and looking back, I saw, through the"
"x35","black pillars of the nearer trees, the flames of the burning forest. It"
"x35","was my first fire coming after me. With that I looked for Weena, but"
"x35","she was gone. The hissing and crackling behind me, the explosive thud"
"x35","as each fresh tree burst into flame, left little time for reflection."
"x35","My iron bar still gripped, I followed in the Morlocks’ path. It was a"
"x35","close race. Once the flames crept forward so swiftly on my right as I"
"x35","ran that I was outflanked and had to strike off to the left. But at"
"x35","last I emerged upon a small open space, and as I did so, a Morlock came"
"x35","blundering towards me, and past me, and went on straight into the fire!"
"x35",""
"x35","“And now I was to see the most weird and horrible thing, I think, of"
"x35","all that I beheld in that future age. This whole space was as bright as"
"x35","day with the reflection of the fire. In the centre was a hillock or"
"x35","tumulus, surmounted by a scorched hawthorn. Beyond this was another arm"
"x35","of the burning forest, with yellow tongues already writhing from it,"
"x35","completely encircling the space with a fence of fire. Upon the hillside"
"x35","were some thirty or forty Morlocks, dazzled by the light and heat, and"
"x35","blundering hither and thither against each other in their bewilderment."
"x35","At first I did not realise their blindness, and struck furiously at"
"x35","them with my bar, in a frenzy of fear, as they approached me, killing"
"x35","one and crippling several more. But when I had watched the gestures of"
"x35","one of them groping under the hawthorn against the red sky, and heard"
"x35","their moans, I was assured of their absolute helplessness and misery in"
"x35","the glare, and I struck no more of them."
"x35",""
"x35","“Yet every now and then one would come straight towards me, setting"
"x35","loose a quivering horror that made me quick to elude him. At one time"
"x35","the flames died down somewhat, and I feared the foul creatures would"
"x35","presently be able to see me. I was thinking of beginning the fight by"
"x35","killing some of them before this should happen; but the fire burst out"
"x35","again brightly, and I stayed my hand. I walked about the hill among"
"x35","them and avoided them, looking for some trace of Weena. But Weena was"
"x35","gone."
"x35",""
"x35","“At last I sat down on the summit of the hillock, and watched this"
"x35","strange incredible company of blind things groping to and fro, and"
"x35","making uncanny noises to each other, as the glare of the fire beat on"
"x35","them. The coiling uprush of smoke streamed across the sky, and through"
"x35","the rare tatters of that red canopy, remote as though they belonged to"
"x35","another universe, shone the little stars. Two or three Morlocks came"
"x35","blundering into me, and I drove them off with blows of my fists,"
"x35","trembling as I did so."
"x35",""
"x35","“For the most part of that night I was persuaded it was a nightmare. I"
"x35","bit myself and screamed in a passionate desire to awake. I beat the"
"x35","ground with my hands, and got up and sat down again, and wandered here"
"x35","and there, and again sat down. Then I would fall to rubbing my eyes and"
"x35","calling upon God to let me awake. Thrice I saw Morlocks put their heads"
"x35","down in a kind of agony and rush into the flames. But, at last, above"
"x35","the subsiding red of the fire, above the streaming masses of black"
"x35","smoke and the whitening and blackening tree stumps, and the diminishing"
"x35","numbers of these dim creatures, came the white light of the day."
"x35",""
"x35","“I searched again for traces of Weena, but there were none. It was"
"x35","plain that they had left her poor little body in the forest. I cannot"
"x35","describe how it relieved me to think that it had escaped the awful fate"
"x35","to which it seemed destined. As I thought of that, I was almost moved"
"x35","to begin a massacre of the helpless abominations about me, but I"
"x35","contained myself. The hillock, as I have said, was a kind of island in"
"x35","the forest. From its summit I could now make out through a haze of"
"x35","smoke the Palace of Green Porcelain, and from that I could get my"
"x35","bearings for the White Sphinx. And so, leaving the remnant of these"
"x35","damned souls still going hither and thither and moaning, as the day"
"x35","grew clearer, I tied some grass about my feet and limped on across"
"x35","smoking ashes and among black stems that still pulsated internally with"
"x35","fire, towards the hiding-place of the Time Machine. I walked slowly,"
"x35","for I was almost exhausted, as well as lame, and I felt the intensest"
"x35","wretchedness for the horrible death of little Weena. It seemed an"
"x35","overwhelming calamity. Now, in this old familiar room, it is more like"
"x35","the sorrow of a dream than an actual loss. But that morning it left me"
"x35","absolutely lonely again—terribly alone. I began to think of this house"
"x35","of mine, of this fireside, of some of you, and with such thoughts came"
"x35","a longing that was pain."
"x35",""
"x35","“But, as I walked over the smoking ashes under the bright morning sky,"

"x35","like blots upon the landscape rose the cupolas above the ways to the"
"x35","Underworld. I understood now what all the beauty of the Overworld"
"x35","people covered. Very pleasant was their day, as pleasant as the day of"

"x35","its watchword, it had attained its hopes—to come to this at last. Once,"
"x35","life and property must have reached almost absolute safety. The rich"
"x35","had been assured of his wealth and comfort, the toiler assured of his"

"x35","perfect state had lacked one thing even for mechanical"
"x35","perfection—absolute permanency. Apparently as time went on, the feeding"
"x35","of an Underworld, however it was effected, had become disjointed."
"x35","Mother Necessity, who had been staved off for a few thousand years,"
"x35","came back again, and she began below. The Underworld being in contact"

"x35","sees on forest moss or on the lichen in caves: plants which like these"
"x35","grow in a perpetual twilight."
"x35",""
"x35","“The machine was standing on a sloping beach. The sea stretched away to"
"x35","the south-west, to rise into a sharp bright horizon against the wan"
"x35","sky. There were no breakers and no waves, for not a breath of wind was"
"x35","stirring. Only a slight oily swell rose and fell like a gentle"
"x35","breathing, and showed that the eternal sea was still moving and living."
"x35","And along the margin where the water sometimes broke was a thick"
"x35","incrustation of salt—pink under the lurid sky. There was a sense of"
"x35","oppression in my head, and I noticed that I was breathing very fast."
"x35","The sensation reminded me of my only experience of mountaineering, and"
"x35","from that I judged the air to be more rarefied than it is now."
"x35",""
"x35","“Far away up the desolate slope I heard a harsh scream, and saw a thing"
"x35","like a huge white butterfly go slanting and fluttering up into the sky"
"x35","and, circling, disappear over some low hillocks beyond. The sound of"
"x35","its voice was so dismal that I shivered and seated myself more firmly"
"x35","upon the machine. Looking round me again, I saw that, quite near, what"
"x35","I had taken to be a reddish mass of rock was moving slowly towards me."
"x35","Then I saw the thing was really a monstrous crab-like creature. Can you"
"x35","imagine a crab as large as yonder table, with its many legs moving"
"x35","slowly and uncertainly, its big claws swaying, its long antennæ, like"
"x35","carters’ whips, waving and feeling, and its stalked eyes gleaming at"
"x35","you on either side of its metallic front? Its back was corrugated and"
"x35","ornamented with ungainly bosses, and a greenish incrustation blotched"
"x35","it here and there. I could see the many palps of its complicated mouth"
"x35","flickering and feeling as it moved."
"x35",""
"x35","“As I stared at this sinister apparition crawling towards me, I felt a"
"x35","tickling on my cheek as though a fly had lighted there. I tried to"
"x35","brush it away with my hand, but in a moment it returned, and almost"
"x35","immediately came another by my ear. I struck at this, and caught"
"x35","something threadlike. It was drawn swiftly out of my hand. With a"
"x35","frightful qualm, I turned, and I saw that I had grasped the antenna of"
"x35","another monster crab that stood just behind me. Its evil eyes were"
"x35","wriggling on their stalks, its mouth was all alive with appetite, and"
"x35","its vast ungainly claws, smeared with an algal slime, were descending"
"x35","upon me. In a moment my hand was on the lever, and I had placed a month"
"x35","between myself and these monsters. But I was still on the same beach,"
"x35","and I saw them distinctly now as soon as I stopped. Dozens of them"
"x35","seemed to be crawling here and there, in the sombre light, among the"
"x35","foliated sheets of intense green."
"x35",""
"x35","“I cannot convey the sense of abominable desolation that hung over the"
"x35","world. The red eastern sky, the northward blackness, the salt Dead Sea,"
"x35","the stony beach crawling with these foul, slow-stirring monsters, the"
"x35","uniform poisonous-looking green of the lichenous plants, the thin air"
"x35","that hurts one’s lungs: all contributed to an appalling effect. I moved"
"x35","on a hundred years, and there was the same red sun—a little larger, a"
"x35","little duller—the same dying sea, the same chill air, and the same"
"x35","crowd of earthy crustacea creeping in and out among the green weed and"
"x35","the red rocks. And in the westward sky, I saw a curved pale line like a"
"x35","vast new moon."
"x35",""
"x35","“So I travelled, stopping ever and again, in great strides of a"
"x35","thousand years or more, drawn on by the mystery of the earth’s fate,"
"x35","watching with a strange fascination the sun grow larger and duller in"
"x35","the westward sky, and the life of the old earth ebb away. At last, more"
"x35","than thirty million years hence, the huge red-hot dome of the sun had"
"x35","come to obscure nearly a tenth part of the darkling heavens. Then I"
"x35","stopped once more, for the crawling multitude of crabs had disappeared,"
"x35","and the red beach, save for its livid green liverworts and lichens,"
"x35","seemed lifeless. And now it was flecked with white. A bitter cold"
"x35","assailed me. Rare white flakes ever and again came eddying down. To the"
"x35","north-eastward, the glare of snow lay under the starlight of the sable"
"x35","sky, and I could see an undulating crest of hillocks pinkish white."
"x35","There were fringes of ice along the sea margin, with drifting masses"
"x35","farther out; but the main expanse of that salt ocean, all bloody under"
"x35","the eternal sunset, was still unfrozen."
"x35",""
"x35","“I looked about me to see if any traces of animal life remained. A"
"x35","certain indefinable apprehension still kept me in the saddle of the"
"x35","machine. But I saw nothing moving, in earth or sky or sea. The green"
"x35","slime on the rocks alone testified that life was not extinct. A shallow"
"x35","sandbank had appeared in the sea and the water had receded from the"
"x35","beach. I fancied I saw some black object flopping about upon this bank,"
"x35","but it became motionless as I looked at it, and I judged that my eye"
"x35","had been deceived, and that the black object was merely a rock. The"
"x35","stars in the sky were intensely bright and seemed to me to twinkle very"
"x35","little."
"x35",""
"x35","“Suddenly I noticed that the circular westward outline of the sun had"
"x35","changed; that a concavity, a bay, had appeared in the curve. I saw this"
"x35","grow larger. For a minute perhaps I stared aghast at this blackness"
"x35","that was creeping over the day, and then I realised that an eclipse was"
"x35","beginning. Either the moon or the planet Mercury was passing across the"
"x35","sun’s disk. Naturally, at first I took it to be the moon, but there is"
"x35","much to incline me to believe that what I really saw was the transit of"
"x35","an inner planet passing very near to the earth."
"x35",""
"x35","“The darkness grew apace; a cold wind began to blow in freshening gusts"
"x35","from the east, and the showering white flakes in the air increased in"
"x35","number. From the edge of the sea came a ripple and whisper. Beyond"
"x35","these lifeless sounds the world was silent. Silent? It would be hard to"
"x35","convey the stillness of it. All the sounds of man, the bleating of"
"x35","sheep, the cries of birds, the hum of insects, the stir that makes the"
"x35","background of our lives—all that was over. As the darkness thickened,"
"x35","the eddying flakes grew more abundant, dancing before my eyes; and the"
"x35","cold of the air more intense. At last, one by one, swiftly, one after"
"x35","the other, the white peaks of the distant hills vanished into"
"x35","blackness. The breeze rose to a moaning wind. I saw the black central"
"x35","shadow of the eclipse sweeping towards me. In another moment the pale"
"x35","stars alone were visible. All else was rayless obscurity. The sky was"
"x35","absolutely black."
"x35",""
"x35","“A horror of this great darkness came on me. The cold, that smote to my"
"x35","marrow, and the pain I felt in breathing, overcame me. I shivered, and"
"x35","a deadly nausea seized me. Then like a red-hot bow in the sky appeared"
"x35","the edge of the sun. I got off the machine to recover myself. I felt"
"x35","giddy and incapable of facing the return journey. As I stood sick and"
"x35","confused I saw again the moving thing upon the shoal—there was no"
"x35","mistake now that it was a moving thing—against the red water of the"
"x35","sea. It was a round thing, the size of a football perhaps, or, it may"
"x35","be, bigger, and tentacles trailed down from it; it seemed black against"
"x35","the weltering blood-red water, and it was hopping fitfully about. Then"
"x35","I felt I was fainting. But a terrible dread of lying helpless in that"
"x35","remote and awful twilight sustained me while I clambered upon the"
"x35","saddle."

"x35",""
"x35","“So I came back. For a long time I must have been insensible upon the"
"x35","machine. The blinking succession of the days and nights was resumed,"
"x35","the sun got golden again, the sky blue. I breathed with greater"
"x35","freedom. The fluctuating contours of the land ebbed and flowed. The"
"x35","hands spun backward upon the dials. At last I saw again the dim shadows"
"x35","of houses, the evidences of decadent humanity. These, too, changed and"
"x35","passed, and others came. Presently, when the million dial was at zero,"
"x35","I slackened speed. I began to recognise our own pretty and familiar"
"x35","architecture, the thousands hand ran back to the starting-point, the"
"x35","night and day flapped slower and slower. Then the old walls of the"
"x35","laboratory came round me. Very gently, now, I slowed the mechanism"
"x35","down."
"x35",""
"x35","“I saw one little thing that seemed odd to me. I think I have told you"
"x35","that when I set out, before my velocity became very high, Mrs. Watchett"
"x35","had walked across the room, travelling, as it seemed to me, like a"
"x35","rocket. As I returned, I passed again across that minute when she"
"x35","traversed the laboratory. But now her every motion appeared to be the"
"x35","exact inversion of her previous ones. The door at the lower end opened,"
"x35","and she glided quietly up the laboratory, back foremost, and"
"x35","disappeared behind the door by which she had previously entered. Just"
"x35","before that I seemed to see Hillyer for a moment; but he passed like a"
"x35","flash."
"x35",""
"x35","“Then I stopped the machine, and saw about me again the old familiar"
"x35","laboratory, my tools, my appliances just as I had left them. I got off"
"x35","the thing very shakily, and sat down upon my bench. For several minutes"
"x35","I trembled violently. Then I became calmer. Around me was my old"
"x35","workshop again, exactly as it had been. I might have slept there, and"
"x35","the whole thing have been a dream."
"x35",""
"x35","“And yet, not exactly! The thing had started from the south-east corner"
"x35","of the laboratory. It had come to rest again in the north-west, against"
"x35","the wall where you saw it. That gives you the exact distance from my"
"x35","little lawn to the pedestal of the White Sphinx, into which the"
"x35","Morlocks had carried my machine."
"x35",""
"x35","“For a time my brain went stagnant. Presently I got up and came through"
"x35","the passage here, limping, because my heel was still painful, and"
"x35","feeling sorely begrimed. I saw the _Pall Mall Gazette_ on the table by"
"x35","the door. I found the date was indeed today, and looking at the"
"x35","timepiece, saw the hour was almost eight o’clock. I heard your voices"
"x35","and the clatter of plates. I hesitated—I felt so sick and weak. Then I"
"x35","sniffed good wholesome meat, and opened the door on you. You know the"

"x35","“I know,” he said, after a pause, “that all this will be absolutely"
"x35","incredible to you, but to me the one incredible thing is that I am here"
"x35","tonight in this old familiar room looking into your friendly faces and"
"x35","telling you these strange adventures.” He looked at the Medical Man."
"x35","“No. I cannot expect you to believe it. Take it as a lie—or a prophecy."
"x35","Say I dreamed it in the workshop. Consider I have been speculating upon"
"x35","the destinies of our race, until I have hatched this fiction. Treat my"
"x35","assertion of its truth as a mere stroke of art to enhance its interest."
"x35","And taking it as a story, what do you think of it?”"
"x35",""
"x35","He took up his pipe, and began, in his old accustomed manner, to tap"
"x35","with it nervously upon the bars of the grate. There was a momentary"
"x35","stillness. Then chairs began to creak and shoes to scrape upon the"
"x35","carpet. I took my eyes off the Time Traveller’s face, and looked round"
"x35","at his audience. They were in the dark, and little spots of colour swam"
"x35","before them. The Medical Man seemed absorbed in the contemplation of"
"x35","our host. The Editor was looking hard at the end of his cigar—the"
"x35","sixth. The Journalist fumbled for his watch. The others, as far as I"
"x35","remember, were motionless."
"x35",""
"x35","The Editor stood up with a sigh. “What a pity it is you’re not a writer"

"x35","“You don’t believe it?”"

"x35","“Well——”"

"x35","The Time Traveller turned to us. “Where are the matches?” he said. He"

"x35","His eye fell with a mute inquiry upon the withered white flowers upon"
"x35","the little table. Then he turned over the hand holding his pipe, and I"
"x35","saw he was looking at some half-healed scars on his knuckles."
"x35",""
"x35","The Medical Man rose, came to the lamp, and examined the flowers. “The"
"x35","gynæceum’s odd,” he said. The Psychologist leant forward to see,"
"x35","holding out his hand for a specimen."
"x35",""
"x35","“I’m hanged if it isn’t a quarter to one,” said the Journalist. “How"
"x35","shall we get home?”"

"x35","“Plenty of cabs at the station,” said the Psychologist."

"x35","The Time Traveller hesitated. Then suddenly: “Certainly not.”"
"x35",""
"x35","“Where did you really get them?” said the Medical Man."
"x35",""
"x35","The Time Traveller put his hand to his head. He spoke like one who was"
"x35","trying to keep hold of an idea that eluded him. “They were put into my"
"x35","pocket by Weena, when I travelled into Time.” He stared round the room."
"x35","“I’m damned if it isn’t all going. This room and you and the atmosphere"
"x35","of every day is too much for my memory. Did I ever make a Time Machine,"
"x35","or a model of a Time Machine? Or is it all only a dream? They say life"
"x35","is a dream, a precious poor dream at times—but I can’t stand another"
"x35","that won’t fit. It’s madness. And where did the dream come from? … I"
"x35","must look at that machine. If there is one!”"
"x35",""
"x35","He caught up the lamp swiftly, and carried it, flaring red, through the"
"x35","door into the corridor. We followed him. There in the flickering light"
"x35","of the lamp was the machine sure enough, squat, ugly, and askew, a"
"x35","thing of brass, ebony, ivory, and translucent glimmering quartz. Solid"
"x35","to the touch—for I put out my hand and felt the rail of it—and with"
"x35","brown spots and smears upon the ivory, and bits of grass and moss upon"
"x35","the lower parts, and one rail bent awry."
"x35",""
"x35","The Time Traveller put the lamp down on the bench, and ran his hand"
"x35","along the damaged rail. “It’s all right now,” he said. “The story I"
"x35","told you was true. I’m sorry to have brought you out here in the cold.”"
"x35","He took up the lamp, and, in an absolute silence, we returned to the"
"x35","smoking-room."
"x35",""
"x35","He came into the hall with us and helped the Editor on with his coat."
"x35","The Medical Man looked into his face and, with a certain hesitation,"
"x35","told him he was suffering from overwork, at which he laughed hugely. I"
"x35","remember him standing in the open doorway, bawling good-night."
"x35",""
"x35","I shared a cab with the Editor. He thought the tale a “gaudy lie.” For"
"x35","my own part I was unable to come to a conclusion. The story was so"
"x35","fantastic and incredible, the telling so credible and sober. I lay"
"x35","awake most of the night thinking about it. I determined to go next day"
"x35","and see the Time Traveller again. I was told he was in the laboratory,"
"x35","and being on easy terms in the house, I went up to him. The laboratory,"
"x35","however, was empty. I stared for a minute at the Time Machine and put"
"x35","out my hand and touched the lever. At that the squat"
"x35","substantial-looking mass swayed like a bough shaken by the wind. Its"
"x35","instability startled me extremely, and I had a queer reminiscence of"
"x35","the childish days when I used to be forbidden to meddle. I came back"
"x35","through the corridor. The Time Traveller met me in the smoking-room. He"
"x35","was coming from the house. He had a small camera under one arm and a"
"x35","knapsack under the other. He laughed when he saw me, and gave me an"
"x35","elbow to shake. “I’m frightfully busy,” said he, “with that thing in"
"x35","there.”"
"x35",""
"x35","“But is it not some hoax?” I said. “Do you really travel through time?”"
"x35",""
"x35","“Really and truly I do.” And he looked frankly into my eyes. He"
"x35","hesitated. His eye wandered about the room. “I only want half an hour,”"
"x35","he said. “I know why you came, and it’s awfully good of you. There’s"
"x35","some magazines here. If you’ll stop to lunch I’ll prove you this time"
"x35","travelling up to the hilt, specimens and all. If you’ll forgive my"
"x35","leaving you now?”"
"x35",""
"x35","I consented, hardly comprehending then the full import of his words,"
"x35","and he nodded and went on down the corridor. I heard the door of the"
"x35","laboratory slam, seated myself in a chair, and took up a daily paper."
"x35","What was he going to do before lunch-time? Then suddenly I was reminded"
"x35","by an advertisement that I had promised to meet Richardson, the"
"x35","publisher, at two. I looked at my watch, and saw that I could barely"
"x35","save that engagement. I got up and went down the passage to tell the"
"x35","Time Traveller."
"x35",""
"x35","As I took hold of the handle of the door I heard an exclamation, oddly"
"x35","truncated at the end, and a click and a thud. A gust of air whirled"
"x35","round me as I opened the door, and from within came the sound of broken"
"x35","glass falling on the floor. The Time Traveller was not there. I seemed"
"x35","to see a ghostly, indistinct figure sitting in a whirling mass of black"
"x35","and brass for a moment—a figure so transparent that the bench behind"
"x35","with its sheets of drawings was absolutely distinct; but this phantasm"
"x35","vanished as I rubbed my eyes. The Time Machine had gone. Save for a"
"x35","subsiding stir of dust, the further end of the laboratory was empty. A"
"x35","pane of the skylight had, apparently, just been blown in."
"x35",""
"x35","I felt an unreasonable amazement. I knew that something strange had"
"x35","happened, and for the moment could not distinguish what the strange"
"x35","thing might be. As I stood staring, the door into the garden opened,"
"x35","and the man-servant appeared."
"x35",""
"x35","We looked at each other. Then ideas began to come. “Has Mr. —— gone out"
"x35","that way?” said I."
"x35",""
"x35","“No, sir. No one has come out this way. I was expecting to find him"
"x35","here.”"
"x35",""
"x35","At that I understood. At the risk of disappointing Richardson I stayed"
"x35","on, waiting for the Time Traveller; waiting for the second, perhaps"
"x35","still stranger story, and the specimens and photographs he would bring"
"x35","with him. But I am beginning now to fear that I must wait a lifetime."

"x35","One cannot choose but wonder. Will he ever return? It may be that he"

"x35","savages of the Age of Unpolished Stone; into the abysses of the"
"x35","Cretaceous Sea; or among the grotesque saurians, the huge reptilian"

"x35","phrase—be wandering on some plesiosaurus-haunted Oolitic coral reef, or"
"x35","beside the lonely saline seas of the Triassic Age. Or did he go"
"x35","forward, into one of the nearer ages, in which men are still men, but"
"x35","with the riddles of our own time answered and its wearisome problems"
"x35","solved? Into the manhood of the race: for I, for my own part, cannot"
"x35","think that these latter days of weak experiment, fragmentary theory,"
"x35","and mutual discord are indeed man’s culminating time! I say, for my own"
"x35","part. He, I know—for the question had been discussed among us long"
"x35","before the Time Machine was made—thought but cheerlessly of the"
"x35","Advancement of Mankind, and saw in the growing pile of civilisation"
"x35","only a foolish heaping that must inevitably fall back upon and destroy"
"x35","its makers in the end. If that is so, it remains for us to live as"
"x35","though it were not so. But to me the future is still black and blank—is"
"x35","a vast ignorance, lit at a few casual places by the memory of his"
"x35","story. And I have by me, for my comfort, two strange white"
"x35","flowers—shrivelled now, and brown and flat and brittle—to witness that"
"x35","even when mind and strength had gone, gratitude and a mutual tenderness"
"x35","still lived on in the heart of man."

"x36","THE EVE OF THE WAR"
"x36",""
"x36",""
"x36","No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth"
"x36","century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by"
"x36","intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own; that as"
"x36","men busied themselves about their various concerns they were"
"x36","scrutinised and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a"
"x36","microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and"
"x36","multiply in a drop of water.  With infinite complacency men went to"
"x36","and fro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in their"
"x36","assurance of their empire over matter.  It is possible that the"
"x36","infusoria under the microscope do the same.  No one gave a thought to"
"x36","the older worlds of space as sources of human danger, or thought of"
"x36","them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or"
"x36","improbable.  It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of"
"x36","those departed days.  At most terrestrial men fancied there might be"
"x36","other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to"
"x36","welcome a missionary enterprise.  Yet across the gulf of space, minds"
"x36","that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish,"
"x36","intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with"
"x36","envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us.  And"
"x36","early in the twentieth century came the great disillusionment."
"x36",""
"x36","The planet Mars, I scarcely need remind the reader, revolves about the"
"x36","sun at a mean distance of 140,000,000 miles, and the light and heat it"
"x36","receives from the sun is barely half of that received by this world."
"x36","It must be, if the nebular hypothesis has any truth, older than our"
"x36","world; and long before this earth ceased to be molten, life upon its"
"x36","surface must have begun its course.  The fact that it is scarcely one"
"x36","seventh of the volume of the earth must have accelerated its cooling"
"x36","to the temperature at which life could begin.  It has air and water"
"x36","and all that is necessary for the support of animated existence."
"x36",""
"x36","Yet so vain is man, and so blinded by his vanity, that no writer,"
"x36","up to the very end of the nineteenth century, expressed any idea that"
"x36","intelligent life might have developed there far, or indeed at all,"
"x36","beyond its earthly level.  Nor was it generally understood that since"
"x36","Mars is older than our earth, with scarcely a quarter of the"
"x36","superficial area and remoter from the sun, it necessarily follows that"
"x36","it is not only more distant from time's beginning but nearer its end."

"x36","The secular cooling that must someday overtake our planet has"
"x36","already gone far indeed with our neighbour.  Its physical condition is"
"x36","still largely a mystery, but we know now that even in its equatorial"
"x36","region the midday temperature barely approaches that of our coldest"
"x36","winter.  Its air is much more attenuated than ours, its oceans have"
"x36","shrunk until they cover but a third of its surface, and as its slow"
"x36","seasons change huge snowcaps gather and melt about either pole and"
"x36","periodically inundate its temperate zones.  That last stage of"
"x36","exhaustion, which to us is still incredibly remote, has become a"
"x36","present-day problem for the inhabitants of Mars.  The immediate"
"x36","pressure of necessity has brightened their intellects, enlarged their"
"x36","powers, and hardened their hearts.  And looking across space with"
"x36","instruments, and intelligences such as we have scarcely dreamed of,"
"x36","they see, at its nearest distance only 35,000,000 of miles sunward of"
"x36","them, a morning star of hope, our own warmer planet, green with"
"x36","vegetation and grey with water, with a cloudy atmosphere eloquent of"
"x36","fertility, with glimpses through its drifting cloud wisps of broad"
"x36","stretches of populous country and narrow, navy-crowded seas."
"x36",""
"x36","And we men, the creatures who inhabit this earth, must be to them"
"x36","at least as alien and lowly as are the monkeys and lemurs to us.  The"
"x36","intellectual side of man already admits that life is an incessant"
"x36","struggle for existence, and it would seem that this too is the belief"
"x36","of the minds upon Mars.  Their world is far gone in its cooling and"
"x36","this world is still crowded with life, but crowded only with what they"
"x36","regard as inferior animals.  To carry warfare sunward is, indeed,"
"x36","their only escape from the destruction that, generation after"
"x36","generation, creeps upon them."
"x36",""
"x36","And before we judge of them too harshly we must remember what"
"x36","ruthless and utter destruction our own species has wrought, not only"
"x36","upon animals, such as the vanished bison and the dodo, but upon its"
"x36","inferior races.  The Tasmanians, in spite of their human likeness,"
"x36","were entirely swept out of existence in a war of extermination waged"
"x36","by European immigrants, in the space of fifty years.  Are we such"
"x36","apostles of mercy as to complain if the Martians warred in the same"
"x36","spirit?"
"x36",""
"x36","The Martians seem to have calculated their descent with amazing"
"x36","subtlety--their mathematical learning is evidently far in excess of"
"x36","ours--and to have carried out their preparations with a well-nigh"
"x36","perfect unanimity.  Had our instruments permitted it, we might have"
"x36","seen the gathering trouble far back in the nineteenth century.  Men"
"x36","like Schiaparelli watched the red planet--it is odd, by-the-bye, that"
"x36","for countless centuries Mars has been the star of war--but failed to"
"x36","interpret the fluctuating appearances of the markings they mapped so"
"x36","well.  All that time the Martians must have been getting ready."
"x36",""
"x36","During the opposition of 1894 a great light was seen on the"
"x36","illuminated part of the disk, first at the Lick Observatory, then by"
"x36","Perrotin of Nice, and then by other observers.  English readers heard"
"x36","of it first in the issue of _Nature_ dated August 2.  I am inclined to"
"x36","think that this blaze may have been the casting of the huge gun, in"
"x36","the vast pit sunk into their planet, from which their shots were fired"
"x36","at us.  Peculiar markings, as yet unexplained, were seen near the site"
"x36","of that outbreak during the next two oppositions."
"x36",""
"x36","The storm burst upon us six years ago now.  As Mars approached"
"x36","opposition, Lavelle of Java set the wires of the astronomical exchange"
"x36","palpitating with the amazing intelligence of a huge outbreak of"
"x36","incandescent gas upon the planet.  It had occurred towards midnight of"
"x36","the twelfth; and the spectroscope, to which he had at once resorted,"
"x36","indicated a mass of flaming gas, chiefly hydrogen, moving with an"
"x36","enormous velocity towards this earth.  This jet of fire had become"
"x36","invisible about a quarter past twelve.  He compared it to a colossal"
"x36","puff of flame suddenly and violently squirted out of the planet, ""as"
"x36","flaming gases rushed out of a gun."""
"x36",""
"x36","A singularly appropriate phrase it proved.  Yet the next day there"
"x36","was nothing of this in the papers except a little note in the _Daily"
"x36","Telegraph_, and the world went in ignorance of one of the gravest"
"x36","dangers that ever threatened the human race. I might not have heard of"
"x36","the eruption at all had I not met Ogilvy, the well-known astronomer,"
"x36","at Ottershaw.  He was immensely excited at the news, and in the excess"
"x36","of his feelings invited me up to take a turn with him that night in a"
"x36","scrutiny of the red planet."
"x36",""
"x36","In spite of all that has happened since, I still remember that"
"x36","vigil very distinctly: the black and silent observatory, the shadowed"
"x36","lantern throwing a feeble glow upon the floor in the corner, the"
"x36","steady ticking of the clockwork of the telescope, the little slit in"
"x36","the roof--an oblong profundity with the stardust streaked across it."
"x36","Ogilvy moved about, invisible but audible.  Looking through the"
"x36","telescope, one saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet"
"x36","swimming in the field.  It seemed such a little thing, so bright and"
"x36","small and still, faintly marked with transverse stripes, and slightly"
"x36","flattened from the perfect round.  But so little it was, so silvery"
"x36","warm--a pin's-head of light! It was as if it quivered, but really this"
"x36","was the telescope vibrating with the activity of the clockwork that"
"x36","kept the planet in view."
"x36",""
"x36","As I watched, the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller and to"
"x36","advance and recede, but that was simply that my eye was tired.  Forty"
"x36","millions of miles it was from us--more than forty millions of miles of"
"x36","void.  Few people realise the immensity of vacancy in which the dust"
"x36","of the material universe swims."
"x36",""
"x36","Near it in the field, I remember, were three faint points of light,"
"x36","three telescopic stars infinitely remote, and all around it was the"
"x36","unfathomable darkness of empty space.  You know how that blackness"
"x36","looks on a frosty starlight night.  In a telescope it seems far"
"x36","profounder.  And invisible to me because it was so remote and small,"
"x36","flying swiftly and steadily towards me across that incredible"
"x36","distance, drawing nearer every minute by so many thousands of miles,"
"x36","came the Thing they were sending us, the Thing that was to bring so"
"x36","much struggle and calamity and death to the earth.  I never dreamed of"
"x36","it then as I watched; no one on earth dreamed of that unerring"
"x36","missile."
"x36",""
"x36","That night, too, there was another jetting out of gas from the"
"x36","distant planet.  I saw it.  A reddish flash at the edge, the slightest"
"x36","projection of the outline just as the chronometer struck midnight; and"
"x36","at that I told Ogilvy and he took my place.  The night was warm and I"
"x36","was thirsty, and I went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way"
"x36","in the darkness, to the little table where the siphon stood, while"
"x36","Ogilvy exclaimed at the streamer of gas that came out towards us."
"x36",""
"x36","That night another invisible missile started on its way to the"
"x36","earth from Mars, just a second or so under twenty-four hours after the"
"x36","first one.  I remember how I sat on the table there in the blackness,"
"x36","with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes.  I wished I"
"x36","had a light to smoke by, little suspecting the meaning of the minute"
"x36","gleam I had seen and all that it would presently bring me.  Ogilvy"
"x36","watched till one, and then gave it up; and we lit the lantern and"
"x36","walked over to his house.  Down below in the darkness were Ottershaw"
"x36","and Chertsey and all their hundreds of people, sleeping in peace."
"x36",""
"x36","He was full of speculation that night about the condition of Mars,"
"x36","and scoffed at the vulgar idea of its having inhabitants who were"
"x36","signalling us.  His idea was that meteorites might be falling in a"
"x36","heavy shower upon the planet, or that a huge volcanic explosion was in"
"x36","progress.  He pointed out to me how unlikely it was that organic"
"x36","evolution had taken the same direction in the two adjacent planets."
"x36",""
"x36","""The chances against anything manlike on Mars are a million to"
"x36","one,"" he said."
"x36",""
"x36","Hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after"
"x36","about midnight, and again the night after; and so for ten nights, a"
"x36","flame each night.  Why the shots ceased after the tenth no one on"
"x36","earth has attempted to explain.  It may be the gases of the firing"
"x36","caused the Martians inconvenience.  Dense clouds of smoke or dust,"
"x36","visible through a powerful telescope on earth as little grey,"
"x36","fluctuating patches, spread through the clearness of the planet's"
"x36","atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features."
"x36",""
"x36","Even the daily papers woke up to the disturbances at last, and"
"x36","popular notes appeared here, there, and everywhere concerning the"
"x36","volcanoes upon Mars.  The seriocomic periodical _Punch_, I remember,"
"x36","made a happy use of it in the political cartoon.  And, all"
"x36","unsuspected, those missiles the Martians had fired at us drew"
"x36","earthward, rushing now at a pace of many miles a second through the"
"x36","empty gulf of space, hour by hour and day by day, nearer and nearer."
"x36","It seems to me now almost incredibly wonderful that, with that swift"
"x36","fate hanging over us, men could go about their petty concerns as they"
"x36","did.  I remember how jubilant Markham was at securing a new photograph"
"x36","of the planet for the illustrated paper he edited in those days."
"x36","People in these latter times scarcely realise the abundance and"
"x36","enterprise of our nineteenth-century papers.  For my own part, I was"
"x36","much occupied in learning to ride the bicycle, and busy upon a series"
"x36","of papers discussing the probable developments of moral ideas as"
"x36","civilisation progressed."
"x36",""
"x36","One night (the first missile then could scarcely have been"
"x36","10,000,000 miles away) I went for a walk with my wife.  It was"
"x36","starlight and I explained the Signs of the Zodiac to her, and pointed"
"x36","out Mars, a bright dot of light creeping zenithward, towards which so"
"x36","many telescopes were pointed.  It was a warm night.  Coming home, a"
"x36","party of excursionists from Chertsey or Isleworth passed us singing"
"x36","and playing music.  There were lights in the upper windows of the"
"x36","houses as the people went to bed.  From the railway station in the"
"x36","distance came the sound of shunting trains, ringing and rumbling,"
"x36","softened almost into melody by the distance.  My wife pointed out to"
"x36","me the brightness of the red, green, and yellow signal lights hanging"
"x36","in a framework against the sky.  It seemed so safe and tranquil."

"x36","CHAPTER TWO"
"x36",""
"x36","THE FALLING STAR"
"x36",""
"x36",""
"x36","Then came the night of the first falling star.  It was seen early"
"x36","in the morning, rushing over Winchester eastward, a line of flame high"
"x36","in the atmosphere.  Hundreds must have seen it, and taken it for an"
"x36","ordinary falling star.  Albin described it as leaving a greenish"
"x36","streak behind it that glowed for some seconds.  Denning, our greatest"
"x36","authority on meteorites, stated that the height of its first"
"x36","appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles.  It seemed to him"
"x36","that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of him."
"x36",""
"x36","I was at home at that hour and writing in my study; and although my"
"x36","French windows face towards Ottershaw and the blind was up (for I"
"x36","loved in those days to look up at the night sky), I saw nothing of it."
"x36","Yet this strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer"
"x36","space must have fallen while I was sitting there, visible to me had I"
"x36","only looked up as it passed.  Some of those who saw its flight say it"
"x36","travelled with a hissing sound.  I myself heard nothing of that.  Many"
"x36","people in Berkshire, Surrey, and Middlesex must have seen the fall of"
"x36","it, and, at most, have thought that another meteorite had descended."
"x36","No one seems to have troubled to look for the fallen mass that night."
"x36",""
"x36","But very early in the morning poor Ogilvy, who had seen the"
"x36","shooting star and who was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere on"
"x36","the common between Horsell, Ottershaw, and Woking, rose early with the"
"x36","idea of finding it.  Find it he did, soon after dawn, and not far from"
"x36","the sand pits.  An enormous hole had been made by the impact of the"
"x36","projectile, and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every"
"x36","direction over the heath, forming heaps visible a mile and a half"
"x36","away.  The heather was on fire eastward, and a thin blue smoke rose"
"x36","against the dawn."
"x36",""
"x36","The Thing itself lay almost entirely buried in sand, amidst the"
"x36","scattered splinters of a fir tree it had shivered to fragments in its"
"x36","descent.  The uncovered part had the appearance of a huge cylinder,"
"x36","caked over and its outline softened by a thick scaly dun-coloured"
"x36","incrustation.  It had a diameter of about thirty yards.  He approached"
"x36","the mass, surprised at the size and more so at the shape, since most"
"x36","meteorites are rounded more or less completely.  It was, however,"
"x36","still so hot from its flight through the air as to forbid his near"
"x36","approach.  A stirring noise within its cylinder he ascribed to the"
"x36","unequal cooling of its surface; for at that time it had not occurred"
"x36","to him that it might be hollow."
"x36",""
"x36","He remained standing at the edge of the pit that the Thing had made"
"x36","for itself, staring at its strange appearance, astonished chiefly at"
"x36","its unusual shape and colour, and dimly perceiving even then some"
"x36","evidence of design in its arrival.  The early morning was wonderfully"
"x36","still, and the sun, just clearing the pine trees towards Weybridge,"
"x36","was already warm.  He did not remember hearing any birds that morning,"
"x36","there was certainly no breeze stirring, and the only sounds were the"
"x36","faint movements from within the cindery cylinder.  He was all alone on"
"x36","the common."
"x36",""
"x36","Then suddenly he noticed with a start that some of the grey"
"x36","clinker, the ashy incrustation that covered the meteorite, was falling"
"x36","off the circular edge of the end.  It was dropping off in flakes and"
"x36","raining down upon the sand.  A large piece suddenly came off and fell"
"x36","with a sharp noise that brought his heart into his mouth."
"x36",""
"x36","For a minute he scarcely realised what this meant, and, although"
"x36","the heat was excessive, he clambered down into the pit close to the"
"x36","bulk to see the Thing more clearly.  He fancied even then that the"
"x36","cooling of the body might account for this, but what disturbed that"
"x36","idea was the fact that the ash was falling only from the end of the"
"x36","cylinder."
"x36",""
"x36","And then he perceived that, very slowly, the circular top of the"
"x36","cylinder was rotating on its body.  It was such a gradual movement"
"x36","that he discovered it only through noticing that a black mark that had"
"x36","been near him five minutes ago was now at the other side of the"
"x36","circumference.  Even then he scarcely understood what this indicated,"
"x36","until he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk"
"x36","forward an inch or so.  Then the thing came upon him in a flash.  The"
"x36","cylinder was artificial--hollow--with an end that screwed out!"
"x36","Something within the cylinder was unscrewing the top!"
"x36",""
"x36","""Good heavens!"" said Ogilvy.  ""There's a man in it--men in it! Half"
"x36","roasted to death!  Trying to escape!"""
"x36",""
"x36","At once, with a quick mental leap, he linked the Thing with the"
"x36","flash upon Mars."
"x36",""
"x36","The thought of the confined creature was so dreadful to him that he"
"x36","forgot the heat and went forward to the cylinder to help turn.  But"
"x36","luckily the dull radiation arrested him before he could burn his hands"
"x36","on the still-glowing metal.  At that he stood irresolute for a moment,"
"x36","then turned, scrambled out of the pit, and set off running wildly into"
"x36","Woking.  The time then must have been somewhere about six o'clock."
"x36","He met a waggoner and tried to make him understand, but the tale he"
"x36","told and his appearance were so wild--his hat had fallen off in the"
"x36","pit--that the man simply drove on.  He was equally unsuccessful with the"
"x36","potman who was just unlocking the doors of the public-house by Horsell"
"x36","Bridge.  The fellow thought he was a lunatic at large and made an"
"x36","unsuccessful attempt to shut him into the taproom.  That sobered him a"
"x36","little; and when he saw Henderson, the London journalist, in his"
"x36","garden, he called over the palings and made himself understood."
"x36",""
"x36","""Henderson,"" he called, ""you saw that shooting star last night?"""
"x36",""
"x36","""Well?"" said Henderson."
"x36",""
"x36","""It's out on Horsell Common now."""
"x36",""
"x36","""Good Lord!"" said Henderson.  ""Fallen meteorite!  That's good."""
"x36",""
"x36","""But it's something more than a meteorite.  It's a cylinder--an"
"x36","artificial cylinder, man!  And there's something inside."""
"x36",""
"x36","Henderson stood up with his spade in his hand."
"x36",""
"x36","""What's that?"" he said.  He was deaf in one ear."
"x36",""
"x36","Ogilvy told him all that he had seen.  Henderson was a minute or so"
"x36","taking it in.  Then he dropped his spade, snatched up his jacket, and"
"x36","came out into the road.  The two men hurried back at once to the"
"x36","common, and found the cylinder still lying in the same position.  But"
"x36","now the sounds inside had ceased, and a thin circle of bright metal"
"x36","showed between the top and the body of the cylinder.  Air was either"
"x36","entering or escaping at the rim with a thin, sizzling sound."
"x36",""
"x36","They listened, rapped on the scaly burnt metal with a stick, and,"
"x36","meeting with no response, they both concluded the man or men inside"
"x36","must be insensible or dead."
"x36",""
"x36","Of course the two were quite unable to do anything.  They shouted"
"x36","consolation and promises, and went off back to the town again to get"
"x36","help.  One can imagine them, covered with sand, excited and"
"x36","disordered, running up the little street in the bright sunlight just"
"x36","as the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were"
"x36","opening their bedroom windows.  Henderson went into the railway"
"x36","station at once, in order to telegraph the news to London.  The"
"x36","newspaper articles had prepared men's minds for the reception of the"
"x36","idea."
"x36",""
"x36","By eight o'clock a number of boys and unemployed men had already"
"x36","started for the common to see the ""dead men from Mars.""  That was the"
"x36","form the story took.  I heard of it first from my newspaper boy about"
"x36","a quarter to nine when I went out to get my _Daily Chronicle_.  I was"

"x36","CHAPTER THREE"
"x36",""
"x36","ON HORSELL COMMON"
"x36",""
"x36",""
"x36","I found a little crowd of perhaps twenty people surrounding the"
"x36","huge hole in which the cylinder lay.  I have already described the"
"x36","appearance of that colossal bulk, embedded in the ground.  The turf"
"x36","and gravel about it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion.  No"
"x36","doubt its impact had caused a flash of fire.  Henderson and Ogilvy"
"x36","were not there.  I think they perceived that nothing was to be done"
"x36","for the present, and had gone away to breakfast at Henderson's house."
"x36",""
"x36","There were four or five boys sitting on the edge of the Pit, with"
"x36","their feet dangling, and amusing themselves--until I stopped them--by"
"x36","throwing stones at the giant mass.  After I had spoken to them about"
"x36","it, they began playing at ""touch"" in and out of the group of"
"x36","bystanders."
"x36",""
"x36","Among these were a couple of cyclists, a jobbing gardener I"
"x36","employed sometimes, a girl carrying a baby, Gregg the butcher and his"
"x36","little boy, and two or three loafers and golf caddies who were"
"x36","accustomed to hang about the railway station.  There was very little"
"x36","talking.  Few of the common people in England had anything but the"
"x36","vaguest astronomical ideas in those days.  Most of them were staring"
"x36","quietly at the big table like end of the cylinder, which was still as"
"x36","Ogilvy and Henderson had left it.  I fancy the popular expectation of"
"x36","a heap of charred corpses was disappointed at this inanimate bulk."
"x36","Some went away while I was there, and other people came.  I clambered"
"x36","into the pit and fancied I heard a faint movement under my feet.  The"
"x36","top had certainly ceased to rotate."
"x36",""
"x36","It was only when I got thus close to it that the strangeness of"
"x36","this object was at all evident to me.  At the first glance it was"
"x36","really no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown"
"x36","across the road.  Not so much so, indeed.  It looked like a rusty gas"
"x36","float.  It required a certain amount of scientific education to"
"x36","perceive that the grey scale of the Thing was no common oxide, that"
"x36","the yellowish-white metal that gleamed in the crack between the lid"
"x36","and the cylinder had an unfamiliar hue.  ""Extra-terrestrial"" had no"
"x36","meaning for most of the onlookers."
"x36",""
"x36","At that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the Thing had"
"x36","come from the planet Mars, but I judged it improbable that it"
"x36","contained any living creature.  I thought the unscrewing might be"
"x36","automatic.  In spite of Ogilvy, I still believed that there were men"
"x36","in Mars.  My mind ran fancifully on the possibilities of its"
"x36","containing manuscript, on the difficulties in translation that might"
"x36","arise, whether we should find coins and models in it, and so forth."
"x36","Yet it was a little too large for assurance on this idea.  I felt an"
"x36","impatience to see it opened.  About eleven, as nothing seemed"
"x36","happening, I walked back, full of such thought, to my home in Maybury."
"x36","But I found it difficult to get to work upon my abstract"
"x36","investigations."
"x36",""
"x36","In the afternoon the appearance of the common had altered very"
"x36","much.  The early editions of the evening papers had startled London"
"x36","with enormous headlines:"
"x36",""
"x36","  ""A MESSAGE RECEIVED FROM MARS."""

"x36","  ""REMARKABLE STORY FROM WOKING,"""

"x36","and so forth.  In addition, Ogilvy's wire to the Astronomical Exchange"
"x36","had roused every observatory in the three kingdoms."
"x36",""
"x36","There were half a dozen flies or more from the Woking station"
"x36","standing in the road by the sand pits, a basket-chaise from Chobham,"
"x36","and a rather lordly carriage.  Besides that, there was quite a heap of"
"x36","bicycles.  In addition, a large number of people must have walked, in"
"x36","spite of the heat of the day, from Woking and Chertsey, so that there"
"x36","was altogether quite a considerable crowd--one or two gaily dressed"
"x36","ladies among the others."
"x36",""
"x36","It was glaringly hot, not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind,"
"x36","and the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees.  The"
"x36","burning heather had been extinguished, but the level ground towards"
"x36","Ottershaw was blackened as far as one could see, and still giving off"
"x36","vertical streamers of smoke.  An enterprising sweet-stuff dealer in"
"x36","the Chobham Road had sent up his son with a barrow-load of green"
"x36","apples and ginger beer."
"x36",""
"x36","Going to the edge of the pit, I found it occupied by a group of"
"x36","about half a dozen men--Henderson, Ogilvy, and a tall, fair-haired man"
"x36","that I afterwards learned was Stent, the Astronomer Royal, with"
"x36","several workmen wielding spades and pickaxes.  Stent was giving"
"x36","directions in a clear, high-pitched voice.  He was standing on the"

"x36","A large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered, though its"

"x36","The growing crowd, he said, was becoming a serious impediment to"
"x36","their excavations, especially the boys.  They wanted a light railing"
"x36","put up, and help to keep the people back.  He told me that a faint"
"x36","stirring was occasionally still audible within the case, but that the"
"x36","workmen had failed to unscrew the top, as it afforded no grip to them."
"x36","The case appeared to be enormously thick, and it was possible that the"
"x36","faint sounds we heard represented a noisy tumult in the interior."
"x36",""
"x36","I was very glad to do as he asked, and so become one of the"
"x36","privileged spectators within the contemplated enclosure.  I failed to"
"x36","find Lord Hilton at his house, but I was told he was expected from"
"x36","London by the six o'clock train from Waterloo; and as it was then"
"x36","about a quarter past five, I went home, had some tea, and walked up to"
"x36","the station to waylay him."

"x36","THE CYLINDER OPENS"
"x36",""
"x36",""
"x36","When I returned to the common the sun was setting.  Scattered groups"
"x36","were hurrying from the direction of Woking, and one or two persons"
"x36","were returning.  The crowd about the pit had increased, and stood out"
"x36","black against the lemon yellow of the sky--a couple of hundred people,"
"x36","perhaps.  There were raised voices, and some sort of struggle appeared"
"x36","to be going on about the pit.  Strange imaginings passed through my"
"x36","mind.  As I drew nearer I heard Stent's voice:"
"x36",""
"x36","""Keep back!  Keep back!"""
"x36",""
"x36","A boy came running towards me."
"x36",""
"x36","""It's a-movin',"" he said to me as he passed; ""a-screwin' and"
"x36","a-screwin' out.  I don't like it.  I'm a-goin' 'ome, I am."""
"x36",""
"x36","I went on to the crowd.  There were really, I should think, two or"
"x36","three hundred people elbowing and jostling one another, the one or two"
"x36","ladies there being by no means the least active."
"x36",""
"x36","""He's fallen in the pit!"" cried some one."
"x36",""
"x36","""Keep back!"" said several."
"x36",""
"x36","The crowd swayed a little, and I elbowed my way through.  Every one"
"x36","seemed greatly excited.  I heard a peculiar humming sound from the"
"x36","pit."
"x36",""
"x36","""I say!"" said Ogilvy; ""help keep these idiots back.  We don't know"
"x36","what's in the confounded thing, you know!"""
"x36",""
"x36","I saw a young man, a shop assistant in Woking I believe he was,"
"x36","standing on the cylinder and trying to scramble out of the hole again."
"x36","The crowd had pushed him in."
"x36",""
"x36","The end of the cylinder was being screwed out from within.  Nearly"
"x36","two feet of shining screw projected.  Somebody blundered against me,"
"x36","and I narrowly missed being pitched onto the top of the screw.  I"
"x36","turned, and as I did so the screw must have come out, for the lid of"
"x36","the cylinder fell upon the gravel with a ringing concussion.  I stuck"
"x36","my elbow into the person behind me, and turned my head towards the"
"x36","Thing again.  For a moment that circular cavity seemed perfectly black."
"x36","I had the sunset in my eyes."
"x36",""
"x36","I think everyone expected to see a man emerge--possibly something a"
"x36","little unlike us terrestrial men, but in all essentials a man.  I know"
"x36","I did.  But, looking, I presently saw something stirring within the"
"x36","shadow: greyish billowy movements, one above another, and then two"
"x36","luminous disks--like eyes.  Then something resembling a little grey"
"x36","snake, about the thickness of a walking stick, coiled up out of the"
"x36","writhing middle, and wriggled in the air towards me--and then another."
"x36",""
"x36","A sudden chill came over me.  There was a loud shriek from a woman"
"x36","behind.  I half turned, keeping my eyes fixed upon the cylinder still,"
"x36","from which other tentacles were now projecting, and began pushing my"
"x36","way back from the edge of the pit.  I saw astonishment giving place to"
"x36","horror on the faces of the people about me.  I heard inarticulate"
"x36","exclamations on all sides.  There was a general movement backwards."
"x36","I saw the shopman struggling still on the edge of the pit.  I found"
"x36","myself alone, and saw the people on the other side of the pit running"
"x36","off, Stent among them.  I looked again at the cylinder, and"
"x36","ungovernable terror gripped me.  I stood petrified and staring."
"x36",""
"x36","A big greyish rounded bulk, the size, perhaps, of a bear, was"
"x36","rising slowly and painfully out of the cylinder.  As it bulged up and"
"x36","caught the light, it glistened like wet leather."
"x36",""
"x36","Two large dark-coloured eyes were regarding me steadfastly.  The"
"x36","mass that framed them, the head of the thing, was rounded, and had,"
"x36","one might say, a face.  There was a mouth under the eyes, the lipless"
"x36","brim of which quivered and panted, and dropped saliva.  The whole"
"x36","creature heaved and pulsated convulsively.  A lank tentacular"
"x36","appendage gripped the edge of the cylinder, another swayed in the air."
"x36",""
"x36","Those who have never seen a living Martian can scarcely imagine the"
"x36","strange horror of its appearance.  The peculiar V-shaped mouth with"
"x36","its pointed upper lip, the absence of brow ridges, the absence of a"
"x36","chin beneath the wedgelike lower lip, the incessant quivering of this"
"x36","mouth, the Gorgon groups of tentacles, the tumultuous breathing of the"
"x36","lungs in a strange atmosphere, the evident heaviness and painfulness"
"x36","of movement due to the greater gravitational energy of the earth--above"
"x36","all, the extraordinary intensity of the immense eyes--were at"
"x36","once vital, intense, inhuman, crippled and monstrous.  There was"
"x36","something fungoid in the oily brown skin, something in the clumsy"
"x36","deliberation of the tedious movements unspeakably nasty.  Even at this"
"x36","first encounter, this first glimpse, I was overcome with disgust and"
"x36","dread."
"x36",""
"x36","Suddenly the monster vanished.  It had toppled over the brim of the"
"x36","cylinder and fallen into the pit, with a thud like the fall of a great"
"x36","mass of leather.  I heard it give a peculiar thick cry, and forthwith"
"x36","another of these creatures appeared darkly in the deep shadow of the"
"x36","aperture."
"x36",""
"x36","I turned and, running madly, made for the first group of trees,"
"x36","perhaps a hundred yards away; but I ran slantingly and stumbling, for"
"x36","I could not avert my face from these things."
"x36",""
"x36","There, among some young pine trees and furze bushes, I stopped,"
"x36","panting, and waited further developments.  The common round the sand"
"x36","pits was dotted with people, standing like myself in a half-fascinated"
"x36","terror, staring at these creatures, or rather at the heaped gravel at"
"x36","the edge of the pit in which they lay.  And then, with a renewed"
"x36","horror, I saw a round, black object bobbing up and down on the edge of"
"x36","the pit.  It was the head of the shopman who had fallen in, but"
"x36","showing as a little black object against the hot western sun.  Now he"
"x36","got his shoulder and knee up, and again he seemed to slip back until"
"x36","only his head was visible.  Suddenly he vanished, and I could have"
"x36","fancied a faint shriek had reached me.  I had a momentary impulse to"
"x36","go back and help him that my fears overruled."
"x36",""
"x36","Everything was then quite invisible, hidden by the deep pit and the"
"x36","heap of sand that the fall of the cylinder had made.  Anyone coming"
"x36","along the road from Chobham or Woking would have been amazed at the"
"x36","sight--a dwindling multitude of perhaps a hundred people or more"
"x36","standing in a great irregular circle, in ditches, behind bushes,"
"x36","behind gates and hedges, saying little to one another and that in"
"x36","short, excited shouts, and staring, staring hard at a few heaps of"
"x36","sand.  The barrow of ginger beer stood, a queer derelict, black"
"x36","against the burning sky, and in the sand pits was a row of deserted"
"x36","vehicles with their horses feeding out of nosebags or pawing the"
"x36","ground."

"x36","CHAPTER FIVE"
"x36",""
"x36","THE HEAT-RAY"
"x36",""
"x36",""
"x36","After the glimpse I had had of the Martians emerging from the"
"x36","cylinder in which they had come to the earth from their planet, a kind"
"x36","of fascination paralysed my actions.  I remained standing knee-deep in"
"x36","the heather, staring at the mound that hid them.  I was a battleground"
"x36","of fear and curiosity."
"x36",""
"x36","I did not dare to go back towards the pit, but I felt a passionate"
"x36","longing to peer into it.  I began walking, therefore, in a big curve,"
"x36","seeking some point of vantage and continually looking at the sand"
"x36","heaps that hid these new-comers to our earth.  Once a leash of thin"
"x36","black whips, like the arms of an octopus, flashed across the sunset"
"x36","and was immediately withdrawn, and afterwards a thin rod rose up,"
"x36","joint by joint, bearing at its apex a circular disk that spun with a"
"x36","wobbling motion.  What could be going on there?"
"x36",""
"x36","Most of the spectators had gathered in one or two groups--one a"
"x36","little crowd towards Woking, the other a knot of people in the"
"x36","direction of Chobham.  Evidently they shared my mental conflict."
"x36","There were few near me.  One man I approached--he was, I perceived,"
"x36","a neighbour of mine, though I did not know his name--and accosted."
"x36","But it was scarcely a time for articulate conversation."
"x36",""
"x36","""What ugly _brutes_!"" he said.  ""Good God!  What ugly brutes!""  He"
"x36","repeated this over and over again."
"x36",""
"x36","""Did you see a man in the pit?"" I said; but he made no answer to"
"x36","that.  We became silent, and stood watching for a time side by side,"
"x36","deriving, I fancy, a certain comfort in one another's company.  Then I"
"x36","shifted my position to a little knoll that gave me the advantage of a"
"x36","yard or more of elevation and when I looked for him presently he was"
"x36","walking towards Woking."
"x36",""
"x36","The sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened.  The"
"x36","crowd far away on the left, towards Woking, seemed to grow, and I"
"x36","heard now a faint murmur from it.  The little knot of people towards"
"x36","Chobham dispersed.  There was scarcely an intimation of movement from"
"x36","the pit."
"x36",""
"x36","It was this, as much as anything, that gave people courage, and I"
"x36","suppose the new arrivals from Woking also helped to restore"
"x36","confidence.  At any rate, as the dusk came on a slow, intermittent"
"x36","movement upon the sand pits began, a movement that seemed to gather"
"x36","force as the stillness of the evening about the cylinder remained"
"x36","unbroken.  Vertical black figures in twos and threes would advance,"
"x36","stop, watch, and advance again, spreading out as they did so in a thin"
"x36","irregular crescent that promised to enclose the pit in its attenuated"
"x36","horns.  I, too, on my side began to move towards the pit."
"x36",""
"x36","Then I saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sand"
"x36","pits, and heard the clatter of hoofs and the gride of wheels.  I saw a"
"x36","lad trundling off the barrow of apples.  And then, within thirty yards"
"x36","of the pit, advancing from the direction of Horsell, I noted a little"
"x36","black knot of men, the foremost of whom was waving a white flag."
"x36",""
"x36","This was the Deputation.  There had been a hasty consultation, and"
"x36","since the Martians were evidently, in spite of their repulsive forms,"
"x36","intelligent creatures, it had been resolved to show them, by"
"x36","approaching them with signals, that we too were intelligent."
"x36",""
"x36","Flutter, flutter, went the flag, first to the right, then to the"
"x36","left.  It was too far for me to recognise anyone there, but afterwards"
"x36","I learned that Ogilvy, Stent, and Henderson were with others in this"
"x36","attempt at communication.  This little group had in its advance"
"x36","dragged inward, so to speak, the circumference of the now almost"
"x36","complete circle of people, and a number of dim black figures followed"
"x36","it at discreet distances."
"x36",""
"x36","Suddenly there was a flash of light, and a quantity of luminous"
"x36","greenish smoke came out of the pit in three distinct puffs, which"
"x36","drove up, one after the other, straight into the still air."
"x36",""
"x36","This smoke (or flame, perhaps, would be the better word for it) was"
"x36","so bright that the deep blue sky overhead and the hazy stretches of"
"x36","brown common towards Chertsey, set with black pine trees, seemed to"
"x36","darken abruptly as these puffs arose, and to remain the darker after"
"x36","their dispersal.  At the same time a faint hissing sound became"
"x36","audible."
"x36",""
"x36","Beyond the pit stood the little wedge of people with the white flag"
"x36","at its apex, arrested by these phenomena, a little knot of small"
"x36","vertical black shapes upon the black ground.  As the green smoke arose,"
"x36","their faces flashed out pallid green, and faded again as it vanished."
"x36","Then slowly the hissing passed into a humming, into a long, loud,"
"x36","droning noise.  Slowly a humped shape rose out of the pit, and the"
"x36","ghost of a beam of light seemed to flicker out from it."
"x36",""
"x36","Forthwith flashes of actual flame, a bright glare leaping from one"
"x36","to another, sprang from the scattered group of men.  It was as if some"
"x36","invisible jet impinged upon them and flashed into white flame.  It was"
"x36","as if each man were suddenly and momentarily turned to fire."
"x36",""
"x36","Then, by the light of their own destruction, I saw them staggering"
"x36","and falling, and their supporters turning to run."
"x36",""
"x36","I stood staring, not as yet realising that this was death leaping"
"x36","from man to man in that little distant crowd.  All I felt was that it"
"x36","was something very strange.  An almost noiseless and blinding flash of"
"x36","light, and a man fell headlong and lay still; and as the unseen shaft"
"x36","of heat passed over them, pine trees burst into fire, and every dry"
"x36","furze bush became with one dull thud a mass of flames.  And far away"
"x36","towards Knaphill I saw the flashes of trees and hedges and wooden"
"x36","buildings suddenly set alight."
"x36",""
"x36","It was sweeping round swiftly and steadily, this flaming death,"
"x36","this invisible, inevitable sword of heat.  I perceived it coming"
"x36","towards me by the flashing bushes it touched, and was too astounded"
"x36","and stupefied to stir.  I heard the crackle of fire in the sand pits"
"x36","and the sudden squeal of a horse that was as suddenly stilled.  Then"
"x36","it was as if an invisible yet intensely heated finger were drawn"
"x36","through the heather between me and the Martians, and all along a"
"x36","curving line beyond the sand pits the dark ground smoked and crackled."
"x36","Something fell with a crash far away to the left where the road from"
"x36","Woking station opens out on the common.  Forth-with the hissing and"
"x36","humming ceased, and the black, dome-like object sank slowly out of"
"x36","sight into the pit."
"x36",""
"x36","All this had happened with such swiftness that I had stood"
"x36","motionless, dumbfounded and dazzled by the flashes of light.  Had that"
"x36","death swept through a full circle, it must inevitably have slain me in"
"x36","my surprise.  But it passed and spared me, and left the night about me"
"x36","suddenly dark and unfamiliar."
"x36",""
"x36","The undulating common seemed now dark almost to blackness, except"
"x36","where its roadways lay grey and pale under the deep blue sky of the"
"x36","early night.  It was dark, and suddenly void of men.  Overhead the"
"x36","stars were mustering, and in the west the sky was still a pale,"
"x36","bright, almost greenish blue.  The tops of the pine trees and the"
"x36","roofs of Horsell came out sharp and black against the western"
"x36","afterglow.  The Martians and their appliances were altogether"
"x36","invisible, save for that thin mast upon which their restless mirror"
"x36","wobbled.  Patches of bush and isolated trees here and there smoked and"
"x36","glowed still, and the houses towards Woking station were sending up"
"x36","spires of flame into the stillness of the evening air."
"x36",""
"x36","Nothing was changed save for that and a terrible astonishment.  The"
"x36","little group of black specks with the flag of white had been swept out"
"x36","of existence, and the stillness of the evening, so it seemed to me,"
"x36","had scarcely been broken."
"x36",""
"x36","It came to me that I was upon this dark common, helpless,"
"x36","unprotected, and alone.  Suddenly, like a thing falling upon me from"
"x36","without, came--fear."
"x36",""
"x36","With an effort I turned and began a stumbling run through the"
"x36","heather."
"x36",""
"x36","The fear I felt was no rational fear, but a panic terror not only"
"x36","of the Martians, but of the dusk and stillness all about me.  Such an"
"x36","extraordinary effect in unmanning me it had that I ran weeping"
"x36","silently as a child might do.  Once I had turned, I did not dare to"
"x36","look back."
"x36",""
"x36","I remember I felt an extraordinary persuasion that I was being"
"x36","played with, that presently, when I was upon the very verge of safety,"
"x36","this mysterious death--as swift as the passage of light--would leap"
"x36","after me from the pit about the cylinder and strike me down."

"x36","THE HEAT-RAY IN THE CHOBHAM ROAD"
"x36",""
"x36",""
"x36","It is still a matter of wonder how the Martians are able to slay"
"x36","men so swiftly and so silently.  Many think that in some way they are"
"x36","able to generate an intense heat in a chamber of practically absolute"
"x36","non-conductivity.  This intense heat they project in a parallel beam"
"x36","against any object they choose, by means of a polished parabolic"
"x36","mirror of unknown composition, much as the parabolic mirror of a"
"x36","lighthouse projects a beam of light.  But no one has absolutely proved"
"x36","these details.  However it is done, it is certain that a beam of heat"
"x36","is the essence of the matter.  Heat, and invisible, instead of"
"x36","visible, light.  Whatever is combustible flashes into flame at its"
"x36","touch, lead runs like water, it softens iron, cracks and melts glass,"
"x36","and when it falls upon water, incontinently that explodes into steam."
"x36",""
"x36","That night nearly forty people lay under the starlight about the"
"x36","pit, charred and distorted beyond recognition, and all night long the"
"x36","common from Horsell to Maybury was deserted and brightly ablaze."
"x36",""
"x36","The news of the massacre probably reached Chobham, Woking, and"
"x36","Ottershaw about the same time.  In Woking the shops had closed when"
"x36","the tragedy happened, and a number of people, shop people and so"
"x36","forth, attracted by the stories they had heard, were walking over the"
"x36","Horsell Bridge and along the road between the hedges that runs out at"
"x36","last upon the common.  You may imagine the young people brushed up"
"x36","after the labours of the day, and making this novelty, as they would"
"x36","make any novelty, the excuse for walking together and enjoying a"
"x36","trivial flirtation.  You may figure to yourself the hum of voices"
"x36","along the road in the gloaming. . . ."
"x36",""
"x36","As yet, of course, few people in Woking even knew that the cylinder"
"x36","had opened, though poor Henderson had sent a messenger on a bicycle to"
"x36","the post office with a special wire to an evening paper."
"x36",""
"x36","As these folks came out by twos and threes upon the open, they"
"x36","found little knots of people talking excitedly and peering at the"
"x36","spinning mirror over the sand pits, and the newcomers were, no doubt,"
"x36","soon infected by the excitement of the occasion."
"x36",""
"x36","By half past eight, when the Deputation was destroyed, there may"
"x36","have been a crowd of three hundred people or more at this place,"
"x36","besides those who had left the road to approach the Martians nearer."
"x36","There were three policemen too, one of whom was mounted, doing their"
"x36","best, under instructions from Stent, to keep the people back and deter"
"x36","them from approaching the cylinder.  There was some booing from those"
"x36","more thoughtless and excitable souls to whom a crowd is always an"
"x36","occasion for noise and horse-play."
"x36",""
"x36","Stent and Ogilvy, anticipating some possibilities of a collision,"
"x36","had telegraphed from Horsell to the barracks as soon as the Martians"
"x36","emerged, for the help of a company of soldiers to protect these"
"x36","strange creatures from violence.  After that they returned to lead that"
"x36","ill-fated advance.  The description of their death, as it was seen by"
"x36","the crowd, tallies very closely with my own impressions: the three"
"x36","puffs of green smoke, the deep humming note, and the flashes of flame."
"x36",""
"x36","But that crowd of people had a far narrower escape than mine.  Only"
"x36","the fact that a hummock of heathery sand intercepted the lower part of"
"x36","the Heat-Ray saved them.  Had the elevation of the parabolic mirror"
"x36","been a few yards higher, none could have lived to tell the tale.  They"
"x36","saw the flashes and the men falling and an invisible hand, as it were,"
"x36","lit the bushes as it hurried towards them through the twilight.  Then,"
"x36","with a whistling note that rose above the droning of the pit, the beam"
"x36","swung close over their heads, lighting the tops of the beech trees"
"x36","that line the road, and splitting the bricks, smashing the windows,"
"x36","firing the window frames, and bringing down in crumbling ruin a"
"x36","portion of the gable of the house nearest the corner."
"x36",""
"x36","In the sudden thud, hiss, and glare of the igniting trees, the"
"x36","panic-stricken crowd seems to have swayed hesitatingly for some"
"x36","moments.  Sparks and burning twigs began to fall into the road, and"
"x36","single leaves like puffs of flame.  Hats and dresses caught fire.  Then"
"x36","came a crying from the common.  There were shrieks and shouts, and"
"x36","suddenly a mounted policeman came galloping through the confusion with"
"x36","his hands clasped over his head, screaming."
"x36",""
"x36","""They're coming!"" a woman shrieked, and incontinently everyone was"
"x36","turning and pushing at those behind, in order to clear their way to"
"x36","Woking again.  They must have bolted as blindly as a flock of sheep."
"x36","Where the road grows narrow and black between the high banks the crowd"
"x36","jammed, and a desperate struggle occurred.  All that crowd did not"
"x36","escape; three persons at least, two women and a little boy, were"

"x36","HOW I REACHED HOME"

"x36",""
"x36","For my own part, I remember nothing of my flight except the stress"
"x36","of blundering against trees and stumbling through the heather.  All"
"x36","about me gathered the invisible terrors of the Martians; that pitiless"
"x36","sword of heat seemed whirling to and fro, flourishing overhead before"
"x36","it descended and smote me out of life.  I came into the road between"
"x36","the crossroads and Horsell, and ran along this to the crossroads."
"x36",""
"x36","At last I could go no further; I was exhausted with the violence of"
"x36","my emotion and of my flight, and I staggered and fell by the wayside."
"x36","That was near the bridge that crosses the canal by the gasworks.  I"
"x36","fell and lay still."
"x36",""
"x36","I must have remained there some time."
"x36",""
"x36","I sat up, strangely perplexed.  For a moment, perhaps, I could not"
"x36","clearly understand how I came there.  My terror had fallen from me"
"x36","like a garment.  My hat had gone, and my collar had burst away from"
"x36","its fastener.  A few minutes before, there had only been three real"
"x36","things before me--the immensity of the night and space and nature, my"
"x36","own feebleness and anguish, and the near approach of death.  Now it"
"x36","was as if something turned over, and the point of view altered"
"x36","abruptly.  There was no sensible transition from one state of mind to"
"x36","the other.  I was immediately the self of every day again--a decent,"
"x36","ordinary citizen.  The silent common, the impulse of my flight, the"
"x36","starting flames, were as if they had been in a dream.  I asked myself"
"x36","had these latter things indeed happened?  I could not credit it."
"x36",""
"x36","I rose and walked unsteadily up the steep incline of the bridge.  My"
"x36","mind was blank wonder.  My muscles and nerves seemed drained of their"
"x36","strength.  I dare say I staggered drunkenly.  A head rose over the"
"x36","arch, and the figure of a workman carrying a basket appeared.  Beside"
"x36","him ran a little boy.  He passed me, wishing me good night.  I was"
"x36","minded to speak to him, but did not.  I answered his greeting with a"
"x36","meaningless mumble and went on over the bridge."
"x36",""
"x36","Over the Maybury arch a train, a billowing tumult of white, firelit"
"x36","smoke, and a long caterpillar of lighted windows, went flying"
"x36","south--clatter, clatter, clap, rap, and it had gone.  A dim group of"
"x36","people talked in the gate of one of the houses in the pretty little"
"x36","row of gables that was called Oriental Terrace.  It was all so real"
"x36","and so familiar.  And that behind me!  It was frantic, fantastic!"
"x36","Such things, I told myself, could not be."
"x36",""
"x36","Perhaps I am a man of exceptional moods.  I do not know how far my"
"x36","experience is common.  At times I suffer from the strangest sense of"
"x36","detachment from myself and the world about me; I seem to watch it all"
"x36","from the outside, from somewhere inconceivably remote, out of time,"
"x36","out of space, out of the stress and tragedy of it all.  This feeling"
"x36","was very strong upon me that night.  Here was another side to my"
"x36","dream."
"x36",""
"x36","But the trouble was the blank incongruity of this serenity and the"
"x36","swift death flying yonder, not two miles away.  There was a noise of"
"x36","business from the gasworks, and the electric lamps were all alight.  I"
"x36","stopped at the group of people."
"x36",""
"x36","""What news from the common?"" said I."
"x36",""
"x36","There were two men and a woman at the gate."
"x36",""
"x36","""Eh?"" said one of the men, turning."
"x36",""
"x36","""What news from the common?"" I said."
"x36",""
"x36","""'Ain't yer just _been_ there?"" asked the men."
"x36",""
"x36","""People seem fair silly about the common,"" said the woman over the"
"x36","gate.  ""What's it all abart?"""
"x36",""
"x36","""Haven't you heard of the men from Mars?"" said I; ""the creatures"
"x36","from Mars?"""
"x36",""
"x36","""Quite enough,"" said the woman over the gate.  ""Thenks""; and all"
"x36","three of them laughed."
"x36",""
"x36","I felt foolish and angry.  I tried and found I could not tell them"
"x36","what I had seen.  They laughed again at my broken sentences."
"x36",""
"x36","""You'll hear more yet,"" I said, and went on to my home."
"x36",""
"x36","I startled my wife at the doorway, so haggard was I.  I went into"
"x36","the dining room, sat down, drank some wine, and so soon as I could"
"x36","collect myself sufficiently I told her the things I had seen.  The"
"x36","dinner, which was a cold one, had already been served, and remained"
"x36","neglected on the table while I told my story."
"x36",""
"x36","""There is one thing,"" I said, to allay the fears I had aroused;"
"x36","""they are the most sluggish things I ever saw crawl.  They may keep"
"x36","the pit and kill people who come near them, but they cannot get out"
"x36","of it. . . .  But the horror of them!"""
"x36",""
"x36","""Don't, dear!"" said my wife, knitting her brows and putting her"
"x36","hand on mine."
"x36",""
"x36","""Poor Ogilvy!"" I said.  ""To think he may be lying dead there!"""
"x36",""
"x36","My wife at least did not find my experience incredible.  When I saw"
"x36","how deadly white her face was, I ceased abruptly."
"x36",""
"x36","""They may come here,"" she said again and again."
"x36",""
"x36","I pressed her to take wine, and tried to reassure her."
"x36",""
"x36","""They can scarcely move,"" I said."
"x36",""
"x36","I began to comfort her and myself by repeating all that Ogilvy had"
"x36","told me of the impossibility of the Martians establishing themselves"
"x36","on the earth.  In particular I laid stress on the gravitational"
"x36","difficulty.  On the surface of the earth the force of gravity is three"
"x36","times what it is on the surface of Mars.  A Martian, therefore, would"
"x36","weigh three times more than on Mars, albeit his muscular strength"
"x36","would be the same.  His own body would be a cope of lead to him.  That,"
"x36","indeed, was the general opinion.  Both _The Times_ and the _Daily"
"x36","Telegraph_, for instance, insisted on it the next morning, and both"
"x36","overlooked, just as I did, two obvious modifying influences."
"x36",""
"x36","The atmosphere of the earth, we now know, contains far more oxygen"
"x36","or far less argon (whichever way one likes to put it) than does Mars."
"x36","The invigorating influences of this excess of oxygen upon the Martians"
"x36","indisputably did much to counterbalance the increased weight of their"
"x36","bodies.  And, in the second place, we all overlooked the fact that"
"x36","such mechanical intelligence as the Martian possessed was quite able"
"x36","to dispense with muscular exertion at a pinch."
"x36",""
"x36","But I did not consider these points at the time, and so my"
"x36","reasoning was dead against the chances of the invaders.  With wine and"
"x36","food, the confidence of my own table, and the necessity of reassuring"
"x36","my wife, I grew by insensible degrees courageous and secure."
"x36",""
"x36","""They have done a foolish thing,"" said I, fingering my wineglass."
"x36","""They are dangerous because, no doubt, they are mad with terror."
"x36","Perhaps they expected to find no living things--certainly no"
"x36","intelligent living things."""
"x36",""
"x36","""A shell in the pit"" said I, ""if the worst comes to the worst will"
"x36","kill them all."""
"x36",""
"x36","The intense excitement of the events had no doubt left my"
"x36","perceptive powers in a state of erethism.  I remember that dinner"
"x36","table with extraordinary vividness even now.  My dear wife's sweet"
"x36","anxious face peering at me from under the pink lamp shade, the white"
"x36","cloth with its silver and glass table furniture--for in those days"
"x36","even philosophical writers had many little luxuries--the crimson-purple"
"x36","wine in my glass, are photographically distinct.  At the end of"
"x36","it I sat, tempering nuts with a cigarette, regretting Ogilvy's"
"x36","rashness, and denouncing the shortsighted timidity of the Martians."
"x36",""
"x36","So some respectable dodo in the Mauritius might have lorded it in"
"x36","his nest, and discussed the arrival of that shipful of pitiless"
"x36","sailors in want of animal food.  ""We will peck them to death tomorrow,"
"x36","my dear."""

"x36","CHAPTER EIGHT"
"x36",""
"x36","FRIDAY NIGHT"
"x36",""
"x36",""
"x36","The most extraordinary thing to my mind, of all the strange and"
"x36","wonderful things that happened upon that Friday, was the dovetailing"
"x36","of the commonplace habits of our social order with the first"
"x36","beginnings of the series of events that was to topple that social"
"x36","order headlong.  If on Friday night you had taken a pair of compasses"
"x36","and drawn a circle with a radius of five miles round the Woking sand"
"x36","pits, I doubt if you would have had one human being outside it, unless"
"x36","it were some relation of Stent or of the three or four cyclists or"
"x36","London people lying dead on the common, whose emotions or habits were"
"x36","at all affected by the new-comers.  Many people had heard of the"
"x36","cylinder, of course, and talked about it in their leisure, but it"
"x36","certainly did not make the sensation that an ultimatum to Germany"
"x36","would have done."
"x36",""
"x36","In London that night poor Henderson's telegram describing the"
"x36","gradual unscrewing of the shot was judged to be a canard, and his"
"x36","evening paper, after wiring for authentication from him and receiving"
"x36","no reply--the man was killed--decided not to print a special edition."
"x36",""
"x36","Even within the five-mile circle the great majority of people were"
"x36","inert.  I have already described the behaviour of the men and women to"
"x36","whom I spoke.  All over the district people were dining and supping;"
"x36","working men were gardening after the labours of the day, children"
"x36","were being put to bed, young people were wandering through the lanes"
"x36","love-making, students sat over their books."
"x36",""
"x36","Maybe there was a murmur in the village streets, a novel and"
"x36","dominant topic in the public-houses, and here and there a messenger,"
"x36","or even an eye-witness of the later occurrences, caused a whirl of"
"x36","excitement, a shouting, and a running to and fro; but for the most"
"x36","part the daily routine of working, eating, drinking, sleeping, went on"
"x36","as it had done for countless years--as though no planet Mars existed"
"x36","in the sky.  Even at Woking station and Horsell and Chobham that was"
"x36","the case."
"x36",""
"x36","In Woking junction, until a late hour, trains were stopping and"
"x36","going on, others were shunting on the sidings, passengers were"
"x36","alighting and waiting, and everything was proceeding in the most"
"x36","ordinary way.  A boy from the town, trenching on Smith's monopoly, was"
"x36","selling papers with the afternoon's news.  The ringing impact of"
"x36","trucks, the sharp whistle of the engines from the junction, mingled"
"x36","with their shouts of ""Men from Mars!""  Excited men came into the"
"x36","station about nine o'clock with incredible tidings, and caused no more"
"x36","disturbance than drunkards might have done.  People rattling"
"x36","Londonwards peered into the darkness outside the carriage windows, and"
"x36","saw only a rare, flickering, vanishing spark dance up from the"
"x36","direction of Horsell, a red glow and a thin veil of smoke driving"
"x36","across the stars, and thought that nothing more serious than a heath"
"x36","fire was happening.  It was only round the edge of the common that any"
"x36","disturbance was perceptible.  There were half a dozen villas burning"
"x36","on the Woking border.  There were lights in all the houses on the"
"x36","common side of the three villages, and the people there kept awake"
"x36","till dawn."
"x36",""
"x36","A curious crowd lingered restlessly, people coming and going but"
"x36","the crowd remaining, both on the Chobham and Horsell bridges.  One or"
"x36","two adventurous souls, it was afterwards found, went into the darkness"
"x36","and crawled quite near the Martians; but they never returned, for now"
"x36","and again a light-ray, like the beam of a warship's searchlight swept"
"x36","the common, and the Heat-Ray was ready to follow.  Save for such, that"
"x36","big area of common was silent and desolate, and the charred bodies lay"
"x36","about on it all night under the stars, and all the next day.  A noise"
"x36","of hammering from the pit was heard by many people."
"x36",""
"x36","So you have the state of things on Friday night.  In the centre,"
"x36","sticking into the skin of our old planet Earth like a poisoned dart,"
"x36","was this cylinder.  But the poison was scarcely working yet.  Around"
"x36","it was a patch of silent common, smouldering in places, and with a few"
"x36","dark, dimly seen objects lying in contorted attitudes here and there."
"x36","Here and there was a burning bush or tree.  Beyond was a fringe of"
"x36","excitement, and farther than that fringe the inflammation had not"
"x36","crept as yet.  In the rest of the world the stream of life still"
"x36","flowed as it had flowed for immemorial years.  The fever of war that"
"x36","would presently clog vein and artery, deaden nerve and destroy brain,"
"x36","had still to develop."
"x36",""
"x36","All night long the Martians were hammering and stirring, sleepless,"
"x36","indefatigable, at work upon the machines they were making ready, and"
"x36","ever and again a puff of greenish-white smoke whirled up to the"
"x36","starlit sky."
"x36",""
"x36","About eleven a company of soldiers came through Horsell, and"
"x36","deployed along the edge of the common to form a cordon.  Later a"
"x36","second company marched through Chobham to deploy on the north side of"
"x36","the common.  Several officers from the Inkerman barracks had been on"
"x36","the common earlier in the day, and one, Major Eden, was reported to be"
"x36","missing.  The colonel of the regiment came to the Chobham bridge and"
"x36","was busy questioning the crowd at midnight.  The military authorities"
"x36","were certainly alive to the seriousness of the business.  About"
"x36","eleven, the next morning's papers were able to say, a squadron of"
"x36","hussars, two Maxims, and about four hundred men of the Cardigan"
"x36","regiment started from Aldershot."
"x36",""
"x36","A few seconds after midnight the crowd in the Chertsey road,"
"x36","Woking, saw a star fall from heaven into the pine woods to the"
"x36","northwest.  It had a greenish colour, and caused a silent brightness"
"x36","like summer lightning.  This was the second cylinder."

"x36","CHAPTER NINE"
"x36",""
"x36","THE FIGHTING BEGINS"
"x36",""
"x36",""
"x36","Saturday lives in my memory as a day of suspense.  It was a day of"
"x36","lassitude too, hot and close, with, I am told, a rapidly fluctuating"
"x36","barometer.  I had slept but little, though my wife had succeeded in"
"x36","sleeping, and I rose early.  I went into my garden before breakfast"
"x36","and stood listening, but towards the common there was nothing stirring"
"x36","but a lark."
"x36",""
"x36","The milkman came as usual.  I heard the rattle of his chariot and I"
"x36","went round to the side gate to ask the latest news.  He told me that"
"x36","during the night the Martians had been surrounded by troops, and that"
"x36","guns were expected.  Then--a familiar, reassuring note--I heard a train"
"x36","running towards Woking."
"x36",""
"x36","""They aren't to be killed,"" said the milkman, ""if that can possibly"
"x36","be avoided."""
"x36",""
"x36","I saw my neighbour gardening, chatted with him for a time, and then"
"x36","strolled in to breakfast.  It was a most unexceptional morning.  My"
"x36","neighbour was of opinion that the troops would be able to capture or"
"x36","to destroy the Martians during the day."
"x36",""
"x36","""It's a pity they make themselves so unapproachable,"" he said.  ""It"
"x36","would be curious to know how they live on another planet; we might"
"x36","learn a thing or two."""
"x36",""
"x36","He came up to the fence and extended a handful of strawberries, for"
"x36","his gardening was as generous as it was enthusiastic.  At the same"
"x36","time he told me of the burning of the pine woods about the Byfleet"
"x36","Golf Links."
"x36",""
"x36","""They say,"" said he, ""that there's another of those blessed things"
"x36","fallen there--number two.  But one's enough, surely.  This lot'll cost"
"x36","the insurance people a pretty penny before everything's settled.""  He"
"x36","laughed with an air of the greatest good humour as he said this.  The"
"x36","woods, he said, were still burning, and pointed out a haze of smoke to"
"x36","me.  ""They will be hot under foot for days, on account of the thick"
"x36","soil of pine needles and turf,"" he said, and then grew serious over"
"x36","""poor Ogilvy."""
"x36",""
"x36","After breakfast, instead of working, I decided to walk down"
"x36","towards the common.  Under the railway bridge I found a group of"
"x36","soldiers--sappers, I think, men in small round caps, dirty red jackets"
"x36","unbuttoned, and showing their blue shirts, dark trousers, and boots"
"x36","coming to the calf.  They told me no one was allowed over the canal,"
"x36","and, looking along the road towards the bridge, I saw one of the"
"x36","Cardigan men standing sentinel there.  I talked with these soldiers"
"x36","for a time; I told them of my sight of the Martians on the previous"
"x36","evening.  None of them had seen the Martians, and they had but the"
"x36","vaguest ideas of them, so that they plied me with questions.  They"
"x36","said that they did not know who had authorised the movements of the"
"x36","troops; their idea was that a dispute had arisen at the Horse Guards."
"x36","The ordinary sapper is a great deal better educated than the common"
"x36","soldier, and they discussed the peculiar conditions of the possible"
"x36","fight with some acuteness.  I described the Heat-Ray to them, and they"
"x36","began to argue among themselves."
"x36",""
"x36","""Crawl up under cover and rush 'em, say I,"" said one."
"x36",""
"x36","""Get aht!"" said another.  ""What's cover against this 'ere 'eat?"
"x36","Sticks to cook yer!  What we got to do is to go as near as the"
"x36","ground'll let us, and then drive a trench."""
"x36",""
"x36","""Blow yer trenches!  You always want trenches; you ought to ha'"
"x36","been born a rabbit Snippy."""
"x36",""
"x36","""Ain't they got any necks, then?"" said a third, abruptly--a little,"
"x36","contemplative, dark man, smoking a pipe."
"x36",""
"x36","I repeated my description."
"x36",""
"x36","""Octopuses,"" said he, ""that's what I calls 'em.  Talk about fishers"
"x36","of men--fighters of fish it is this time!"""
"x36",""
"x36","""It ain't no murder killing beasts like that,"" said the first"
"x36","speaker."
"x36",""
"x36","""Why not shell the darned things strite off and finish 'em?"" said"
"x36","the little dark man.  ""You carn tell what they might do."""
"x36",""
"x36","""Where's your shells?"" said the first speaker.  ""There ain't no"
"x36","time.  Do it in a rush, that's my tip, and do it at once."""
"x36",""
"x36","So they discussed it.  After a while I left them, and went on to"
"x36","the railway station to get as many morning papers as I could."
"x36",""
"x36","But I will not weary the reader with a description of that long"
"x36","morning and of the longer afternoon.  I did not succeed in getting a"
"x36","glimpse of the common, for even Horsell and Chobham church towers were"
"x36","in the hands of the military authorities.  The soldiers I addressed"
"x36","didn't know anything; the officers were mysterious as well as busy.  I"
"x36","found people in the town quite secure again in the presence of the"
"x36","military, and I heard for the first time from Marshall, the"
"x36","tobacconist, that his son was among the dead on the common.  The"
"x36","soldiers had made the people on the outskirts of Horsell lock up and"
"x36","leave their houses."
"x36",""
"x36","I got back to lunch about two, very tired for, as I have said, the"
"x36","day was extremely hot and dull; and in order to refresh myself I took"
"x36","a cold bath in the afternoon.  About half past four I went up to the"
"x36","railway station to get an evening paper, for the morning papers had"
"x36","contained only a very inaccurate description of the killing of Stent,"
"x36","Henderson, Ogilvy, and the others.  But there was little I didn't"
"x36","know.  The Martians did not show an inch of themselves.  They seemed"
"x36","busy in their pit, and there was a sound of hammering and an almost"
"x36","continuous streamer of smoke.  Apparently they were busy getting ready"
"x36","for a struggle.  ""Fresh attempts have been made to signal, but without"
"x36","success,"" was the stereotyped formula of the papers.  A sapper told me"
"x36","it was done by a man in a ditch with a flag on a long pole.  The"
"x36","Martians took as much notice of such advances as we should of the"
"x36","lowing of a cow."
"x36",""
"x36","I must confess the sight of all this armament, all this"
"x36","preparation, greatly excited me.  My imagination became belligerent,"
"x36","and defeated the invaders in a dozen striking ways; something of my"
"x36","schoolboy dreams of battle and heroism came back.  It hardly seemed a"
"x36","fair fight to me at that time.  They seemed very helpless in that pit"
"x36","of theirs."
"x36",""
"x36","About three o'clock there began the thud of a gun at measured"
"x36","intervals from Chertsey or Addlestone.  I learned that the smouldering"
"x36","pine wood into which the second cylinder had fallen was being shelled,"
"x36","in the hope of destroying that object before it opened.  It was only"
"x36","about five, however, that a field gun reached Chobham for use against"
"x36","the first body of Martians."
"x36",""
"x36","About six in the evening, as I sat at tea with my wife in the"
"x36","summerhouse talking vigorously about the battle that was lowering upon"
"x36","us, I heard a muffled detonation from the common, and immediately"
"x36","after a gust of firing.  Close on the heels of that came a violent"
"x36","rattling crash, quite close to us, that shook the ground; and,"
"x36","starting out upon the lawn, I saw the tops of the trees about the"
"x36","Oriental College burst into smoky red flame, and the tower of the"
"x36","little church beside it slide down into ruin.  The pinnacle of the"
"x36","mosque had vanished, and the roof line of the college itself looked as"
"x36","if a hundred-ton gun had been at work upon it.  One of our chimneys"
"x36","cracked as if a shot had hit it, flew, and a piece of it came"
"x36","clattering down the tiles and made a heap of broken red fragments upon"
"x36","the flower bed by my study window."
"x36",""
"x36","I and my wife stood amazed.  Then I realised that the crest of"
"x36","Maybury Hill must be within range of the Martians' Heat-Ray now that"
"x36","the college was cleared out of the way."
"x36",""
"x36","At that I gripped my wife's arm, and without ceremony ran her out"
"x36","into the road.  Then I fetched out the servant, telling her I would go"
"x36","upstairs myself for the box she was clamouring for."
"x36",""
"x36","""We can't possibly stay here,"" I said; and as I spoke the firing"
"x36","reopened for a moment upon the common."
"x36",""
"x36","""But where are we to go?"" said my wife in terror."
"x36",""
"x36","I thought perplexed.  Then I remembered her cousins at Leatherhead."
"x36",""
"x36","""Leatherhead!"" I shouted above the sudden noise."
"x36",""
"x36","She looked away from me downhill.  The people were coming out of"
"x36","their houses, astonished."
"x36",""
"x36","""How are we to get to Leatherhead?"" she said."
"x36",""
"x36","Down the hill I saw a bevy of hussars ride under the railway"
"x36","bridge; three galloped through the open gates of the Oriental College;"
"x36","two others dismounted, and began running from house to house.  The"
"x36","sun, shining through the smoke that drove up from the tops of the"
"x36","trees, seemed blood red, and threw an unfamiliar lurid light upon"
"x36","everything."
"x36",""
"x36","""Stop here,"" said I; ""you are safe here""; and I started off at once"
"x36","for the Spotted Dog, for I knew the landlord had a horse and dog cart."
"x36","I ran, for I perceived that in a moment everyone upon this side of the"
"x36","hill would be moving.  I found him in his bar, quite unaware of what"
"x36","was going on behind his house.  A man stood with his back to me,"
"x36","talking to him."
"x36",""
"x36","""I must have a pound,"" said the landlord, ""and I've no one to drive"
"x36","it."""
"x36",""
"x36","""I'll give you two,"" said I, over the stranger's shoulder."
"x36",""
"x36","""What for?"""
"x36",""
"x36","""And I'll bring it back by midnight,"" I said."
"x36",""
"x36","""Lord!"" said the landlord; ""what's the hurry?  I'm selling my bit"
"x36","of a pig.  Two pounds, and you bring it back?  What's going on now?"""
"x36",""
"x36","I explained hastily that I had to leave my home, and so secured the"
"x36","dog cart.  At the time it did not seem to me nearly so urgent that the"
"x36","landlord should leave his.  I took care to have the cart there and"
"x36","then, drove it off down the road, and, leaving it in charge of my wife"
"x36","and servant, rushed into my house and packed a few valuables, such"
"x36","plate as we had, and so forth.  The beech trees below the house were"
"x36","burning while I did this, and the palings up the road glowed red."
"x36","While I was occupied in this way, one of the dismounted hussars came"
"x36","running up.  He was going from house to house, warning people to"
"x36","leave.  He was going on as I came out of my front door, lugging my"
"x36","treasures, done up in a tablecloth.  I shouted after him:"
"x36",""
"x36","""What news?"""
"x36",""
"x36","He turned, stared, bawled something about ""crawling out in a thing"
"x36","like a dish cover,"" and ran on to the gate of the house at the crest."
"x36","A sudden whirl of black smoke driving across the road hid him for a"
"x36","moment.  I ran to my neighbour's door and rapped to satisfy myself of"
"x36","what I already knew, that his wife had gone to London with him and had"
"x36","locked up their house.  I went in again, according to my promise, to"
"x36","get my servant's box, lugged it out, clapped it beside her on the tail"
"x36","of the dog cart, and then caught the reins and jumped up into the"
"x36","driver's seat beside my wife.  In another moment we were clear of the"
"x36","smoke and noise, and spanking down the opposite slope of Maybury Hill"
"x36","towards Old Woking."
"x36",""
"x36","In front was a quiet sunny landscape, a wheat field ahead on either"
"x36","side of the road, and the Maybury Inn with its swinging sign.  I saw"
"x36","the doctor's cart ahead of me.  At the bottom of the hill I turned my"
"x36","head to look at the hillside I was leaving.  Thick streamers of black"
"x36","smoke shot with threads of red fire were driving up into the still"
"x36","air, and throwing dark shadows upon the green treetops eastward.  The"
"x36","smoke already extended far away to the east and west--to the Byfleet"
"x36","pine woods eastward, and to Woking on the west.  The road was dotted"
"x36","with people running towards us.  And very faint now, but very distinct"
"x36","through the hot, quiet air, one heard the whirr of a machine-gun that"
"x36","was presently stilled, and an intermittent cracking of rifles."
"x36","Apparently the Martians were setting fire to everything within range"
"x36","of their Heat-Ray."
"x36",""
"x36","I am not an expert driver, and I had immediately to turn my"
"x36","attention to the horse.  When I looked back again the second hill had"
"x36","hidden the black smoke.  I slashed the horse with the whip, and gave"
"x36","him a loose rein until Woking and Send lay between us and that"
"x36","quivering tumult.  I overtook and passed the doctor between Woking and"
"x36","Send."

"x36","CHAPTER TEN"
"x36",""
"x36","IN THE STORM"
"x36",""
"x36",""
"x36","Leatherhead is about twelve miles from Maybury Hill.  The scent of"
"x36","hay was in the air through the lush meadows beyond Pyrford, and the"
"x36","hedges on either side were sweet and gay with multitudes of dog-roses."
"x36","The heavy firing that had broken out while we were driving down"
"x36","Maybury Hill ceased as abruptly as it began, leaving the evening very"
"x36","peaceful and still.  We got to Leatherhead without misadventure about"
"x36","nine o'clock, and the horse had an hour's rest while I took supper"
"x36","with my cousins and commended my wife to their care."
"x36",""
"x36","My wife was curiously silent throughout the drive, and seemed"
"x36","oppressed with forebodings of evil.  I talked to her reassuringly,"
"x36","pointing out that the Martians were tied to the Pit by sheer"
"x36","heaviness, and at the utmost could but crawl a little out of it; but"
"x36","she answered only in monosyllables.  Had it not been for my promise to"
"x36","the innkeeper, she would, I think, have urged me to stay in"
"x36","Leatherhead that night.  Would that I had!  Her face, I remember, was"
"x36","very white as we parted."
"x36",""
"x36","For my own part, I had been feverishly excited all day.  Something"
"x36","very like the war fever that occasionally runs through a civilised"
"x36","community had got into my blood, and in my heart I was not so very"
"x36","sorry that I had to return to Maybury that night.  I was even afraid"
"x36","that that last fusillade I had heard might mean the extermination of"
"x36","our invaders from Mars.  I can best express my state of mind by saying"
"x36","that I wanted to be in at the death."
"x36",""
"x36","It was nearly eleven when I started to return.  The night was"
"x36","unexpectedly dark; to me, walking out of the lighted passage of my"
"x36","cousins' house, it seemed indeed black, and it was as hot and close as"
"x36","the day.  Overhead the clouds were driving fast, albeit not a breath"
"x36","stirred the shrubs about us.  My cousins' man lit both lamps.  Happily,"
"x36","I knew the road intimately.  My wife stood in the light of the"
"x36","doorway, and watched me until I jumped up into the dog cart.  Then"
"x36","abruptly she turned and went in, leaving my cousins side by side"
"x36","wishing me good hap."
"x36",""
"x36","I was a little depressed at first with the contagion of my wife's"
"x36","fears, but very soon my thoughts reverted to the Martians.  At that"
"x36","time I was absolutely in the dark as to the course of the evening's"
"x36","fighting.  I did not know even the circumstances that had precipitated"
"x36","the conflict.  As I came through Ockham (for that was the way I"
"x36","returned, and not through Send and Old Woking) I saw along the western"
"x36","horizon a blood-red glow, which as I drew nearer, crept slowly up the"
"x36","sky.  The driving clouds of the gathering thunderstorm mingled there"
"x36","with masses of black and red smoke."
"x36",""
"x36","Ripley Street was deserted, and except for a lighted window or so"
"x36","the village showed not a sign of life; but I narrowly escaped an"
"x36","accident at the corner of the road to Pyrford, where a knot of people"
"x36","stood with their backs to me.  They said nothing to me as I passed.  I"
"x36","do not know what they knew of the things happening beyond the hill,"
"x36","nor do I know if the silent houses I passed on my way were sleeping"
"x36","securely, or deserted and empty, or harassed and watching against the"
"x36","terror of the night."
"x36",""
"x36","From Ripley until I came through Pyrford I was in the valley of the"
"x36","Wey, and the red glare was hidden from me.  As I ascended the little"
"x36","hill beyond Pyrford Church the glare came into view again, and the"
"x36","trees about me shivered with the first intimation of the storm that"
"x36","was upon me.  Then I heard midnight pealing out from Pyrford Church"
"x36","behind me, and then came the silhouette of Maybury Hill, with its"
"x36","tree-tops and roofs black and sharp against the red."
"x36",""
"x36","Even as I beheld this a lurid green glare lit the road about me and"
"x36","showed the distant woods towards Addlestone.  I felt a tug at the"
"x36","reins.  I saw that the driving clouds had been pierced as it were by a"
"x36","thread of green fire, suddenly lighting their confusion and falling"
"x36","into the field to my left.  It was the third falling star!"
"x36",""
"x36","Close on its apparition, and blindingly violet by contrast, danced"
"x36","out the first lightning of the gathering storm, and the thunder burst"
"x36","like a rocket overhead.  The horse took the bit between his teeth and"
"x36","bolted."
"x36",""
"x36","A moderate incline runs towards the foot of Maybury Hill, and down"
"x36","this we clattered.  Once the lightning had begun, it went on in as"
"x36","rapid a succession of flashes as I have ever seen.  The thunderclaps,"
"x36","treading one on the heels of another and with a strange crackling"
"x36","accompaniment, sounded more like the working of a gigantic electric"
"x36","machine than the usual detonating reverberations.  The flickering"
"x36","light was blinding and confusing, and a thin hail smote gustily at my"
"x36","face as I drove down the slope."
"x36",""
"x36","At first I regarded little but the road before me, and then"
"x36","abruptly my attention was arrested by something that was moving"
"x36","rapidly down the opposite slope of Maybury Hill.  At first I took it"
"x36","for the wet roof of a house, but one flash following another showed it"
"x36","to be in swift rolling movement.  It was an elusive vision--a moment"
"x36","of bewildering darkness, and then, in a flash like daylight, the red"
"x36","masses of the Orphanage near the crest of the hill, the green tops of"
"x36","the pine trees, and this problematical object came out clear and sharp"
"x36","and bright."
"x36",""
"x36","And this Thing I saw!  How can I describe it?  A monstrous tripod,"
"x36","higher than many houses, striding over the young pine trees, and"
"x36","smashing them aside in its career; a walking engine of glittering"
"x36","metal, striding now across the heather; articulate ropes of steel"
"x36","dangling from it, and the clattering tumult of its passage mingling"
"x36","with the riot of the thunder.  A flash, and it came out vividly,"
"x36","heeling over one way with two feet in the air, to vanish and reappear"
"x36","almost instantly as it seemed, with the next flash, a hundred yards"
"x36","nearer.  Can you imagine a milking stool tilted and bowled violently"
"x36","along the ground?  That was the impression those instant flashes gave."
"x36","But instead of a milking stool imagine it a great body of machinery on"
"x36","a tripod stand."
"x36",""
"x36","Then suddenly the trees in the pine wood ahead of me were parted,"
"x36","as brittle reeds are parted by a man thrusting through them; they were"
"x36","snapped off and driven headlong, and a second huge tripod appeared,"
"x36","rushing, as it seemed, headlong towards me.  And I was galloping hard"
"x36","to meet it! At the sight of the second monster my nerve went"
"x36","altogether.  Not stopping to look again, I wrenched the horse's head"
"x36","hard round to the right and in another moment the dog cart had heeled"
"x36","over upon the horse; the shafts smashed noisily, and I was flung"
"x36","sideways and fell heavily into a shallow pool of water."
"x36",""
"x36","I crawled out almost immediately, and crouched, my feet still in"
"x36","the water, under a clump of furze.  The horse lay motionless (his neck"
"x36","was broken, poor brute!) and by the lightning flashes I saw the black"
"x36","bulk of the overturned dog cart and the silhouette of the wheel still"
"x36","spinning slowly.  In another moment the colossal mechanism went"
"x36","striding by me, and passed uphill towards Pyrford."
"x36",""
"x36","Seen nearer, the Thing was incredibly strange, for it was no mere"
"x36","insensate machine driving on its way.  Machine it was, with a ringing"
"x36","metallic pace, and long, flexible, glittering tentacles (one of which"
"x36","gripped a young pine tree) swinging and rattling about its strange"
"x36","body.  It picked its road as it went striding along, and the brazen"
"x36","hood that surmounted it moved to and fro with the inevitable"
"x36","suggestion of a head looking about.  Behind the main body was a huge"
"x36","mass of white metal like a gigantic fisherman's basket, and puffs of"
"x36","green smoke squirted out from the joints of the limbs as the monster"
"x36","swept by me.  And in an instant it was gone."
"x36",""
"x36","So much I saw then, all vaguely for the flickering of the"
"x36","lightning, in blinding highlights and dense black shadows."
"x36",""
"x36","As it passed it set up an exultant deafening howl that drowned the"
"x36","thunder--""Aloo!  Aloo!""--and in another minute it was with its"
"x36","companion, half a mile away, stooping over something in the field.  I"
"x36","have no doubt this Thing in the field was the third of the ten"
"x36","cylinders they had fired at us from Mars."
"x36",""
"x36","For some minutes I lay there in the rain and darkness watching, by"
"x36","the intermittent light, these monstrous beings of metal moving about"
"x36","in the distance over the hedge tops.  A thin hail was now beginning,"
"x36","and as it came and went their figures grew misty and then flashed into"
"x36","clearness again.  Now and then came a gap in the lightning, and the"
"x36","night swallowed them up."
"x36",""
"x36","I was soaked with hail above and puddle water below.  It was some"
"x36","time before my blank astonishment would let me struggle up the bank to"
"x36","a drier position, or think at all of my imminent peril."
"x36",""
"x36","Not far from me was a little one-roomed squatter's hut of wood,"
"x36","surrounded by a patch of potato garden.  I struggled to my feet at"
"x36","last, and, crouching and making use of every chance of cover, I made a"
"x36","run for this.  I hammered at the door, but I could not make the people"
"x36","hear (if there were any people inside), and after a time I desisted,"
"x36","and, availing myself of a ditch for the greater part of the way,"
"x36","succeeded in crawling, unobserved by these monstrous machines, into"
"x36","the pine woods towards Maybury."
"x36",""
"x36","Under cover of this I pushed on, wet and shivering now, towards my"
"x36","own house.  I walked among the trees trying to find the footpath.  It"
"x36","was very dark indeed in the wood, for the lightning was now becoming"
"x36","infrequent, and the hail, which was pouring down in a torrent, fell in"
"x36","columns through the gaps in the heavy foliage."
"x36",""
"x36","If I had fully realised the meaning of all the things I had seen I"
"x36","should have immediately worked my way round through Byfleet to Street"
"x36","Cobham, and so gone back to rejoin my wife at Leatherhead.  But that"
"x36","night the strangeness of things about me, and my physical"
"x36","wretchedness, prevented me, for I was bruised, weary, wet to the skin,"
"x36","deafened and blinded by the storm."
"x36",""
"x36","I had a vague idea of going on to my own house, and that was as"
"x36","much motive as I had.  I staggered through the trees, fell into a"
"x36","ditch and bruised my knees against a plank, and finally splashed out"
"x36","into the lane that ran down from the College Arms.  I say splashed,"
"x36","for the storm water was sweeping the sand down the hill in a muddy"
"x36","torrent.  There in the darkness a man blundered into me and sent me"
"x36","reeling back."
"x36",""
"x36","He gave a cry of terror, sprang sideways, and rushed on before I"
"x36","could gather my wits sufficiently to speak to him.  So heavy was the"
"x36","stress of the storm just at this place that I had the hardest task to"
"x36","win my way up the hill.  I went close up to the fence on the left and"
"x36","worked my way along its palings."
"x36",""
"x36","Near the top I stumbled upon something soft, and, by a flash of"
"x36","lightning, saw between my feet a heap of black broadcloth and a pair"
"x36","of boots.  Before I could distinguish clearly how the man lay, the"
"x36","flicker of light had passed.  I stood over him waiting for the next"
"x36","flash.  When it came, I saw that he was a sturdy man, cheaply but not"
"x36","shabbily dressed; his head was bent under his body, and he lay"
"x36","crumpled up close to the fence, as though he had been flung violently"
"x36","against it."
"x36",""
"x36","Overcoming the repugnance natural to one who had never before"
"x36","touched a dead body, I stooped and turned him over to feel for his"
"x36","heart.  He was quite dead.  Apparently his neck had been broken.  The"
"x36","lightning flashed for a third time, and his face leaped upon me.  I"
"x36","sprang to my feet.  It was the landlord of the Spotted Dog, whose"
"x36","conveyance I had taken."
"x36",""
"x36","I stepped over him gingerly and pushed on up the hill.  I made my"
"x36","way by the police station and the College Arms towards my own house."
"x36","Nothing was burning on the hillside, though from the common there"
"x36","still came a red glare and a rolling tumult of ruddy smoke beating up"
"x36","against the drenching hail.  So far as I could see by the flashes, the"
"x36","houses about me were mostly uninjured.  By the College Arms a dark"
"x36","heap lay in the road."
"x36",""
"x36","Down the road towards Maybury Bridge there were voices and the"
"x36","sound of feet, but I had not the courage to shout or to go to them.  I"
"x36","let myself in with my latchkey, closed, locked and bolted the door,"
"x36","staggered to the foot of the staircase, and sat down.  My imagination"
"x36","was full of those striding metallic monsters, and of the dead body"
"x36","smashed against the fence."
"x36",""
"x36","I crouched at the foot of the staircase with my back to the wall,"
"x36","shivering violently."

"x36","CHAPTER ELEVEN"
"x36",""
"x36","AT THE WINDOW"
"x36",""
"x36",""
"x36","I have already said that my storms of emotion have a trick of"
"x36","exhausting themselves.  After a time I discovered that I was cold and"
"x36","wet, and with little pools of water about me on the stair carpet.  I"
"x36","got up almost mechanically, went into the dining room and drank some"
"x36","whiskey, and then I was moved to change my clothes."
"x36",""
"x36","After I had done that I went upstairs to my study, but why I did so"
"x36","I do not know.  The window of my study looks over the trees and the"
"x36","railway towards Horsell Common.  In the hurry of our departure this"
"x36","window had been left open.  The passage was dark, and, by contrast with"
"x36","the picture the window frame enclosed, the side of the room seemed"
"x36","impenetrably dark.  I stopped short in the doorway."
"x36",""
"x36","The thunderstorm had passed.  The towers of the Oriental College"
"x36","and the pine trees about it had gone, and very far away, lit by a"
"x36","vivid red glare, the common about the sand pits was visible.  Across"
"x36","the light huge black shapes, grotesque and strange, moved busily to"
"x36","and fro."
"x36",""
"x36","It seemed indeed as if the whole country in that direction was on"
"x36","fire--a broad hillside set with minute tongues of flame, swaying and"
"x36","writhing with the gusts of the dying storm, and throwing a red"
"x36","reflection upon the cloud-scud above.  Every now and then a haze of"
"x36","smoke from some nearer conflagration drove across the window and hid"
"x36","the Martian shapes.  I could not see what they were doing, nor the"
"x36","clear form of them, nor recognise the black objects they were busied"
"x36","upon.  Neither could I see the nearer fire, though the reflections of"
"x36","it danced on the wall and ceiling of the study.  A sharp, resinous"
"x36","tang of burning was in the air."
"x36",""
"x36","I closed the door noiselessly and crept towards the window.  As I"
"x36","did so, the view opened out until, on the one hand, it reached to the"
"x36","houses about Woking station, and on the other to the charred and"
"x36","blackened pine woods of Byfleet.  There was a light down below the"
"x36","hill, on the railway, near the arch, and several of the houses along"
"x36","the Maybury road and the streets near the station were glowing ruins."
"x36","The light upon the railway puzzled me at first; there were a black"
"x36","heap and a vivid glare, and to the right of that a row of yellow"
"x36","oblongs.  Then I perceived this was a wrecked train, the fore part"
"x36","smashed and on fire, the hinder carriages still upon the rails."
"x36",""
"x36","Between these three main centres of light--the houses, the train,"
"x36","and the burning county towards Chobham--stretched irregular patches of"
"x36","dark country, broken here and there by intervals of dimly glowing and"
"x36","smoking ground.  It was the strangest spectacle, that black expanse set"
"x36","with fire.  It reminded me, more than anything else, of the Potteries"
"x36","at night.  At first I could distinguish no people at all, though I"
"x36","peered intently for them.  Later I saw against the light of Woking"
"x36","station a number of black figures hurrying one after the other across"
"x36","the line."
"x36",""
"x36","And this was the little world in which I had been living securely"
"x36","for years, this fiery chaos!  What had happened in the last seven"
"x36","hours I still did not know; nor did I know, though I was beginning to"
"x36","guess, the relation between these mechanical colossi and the sluggish"
"x36","lumps I had seen disgorged from the cylinder.  With a queer feeling of"
"x36","impersonal interest I turned my desk chair to the window, sat down,"
"x36","and stared at the blackened country, and particularly at the three"
"x36","gigantic black things that were going to and fro in the glare about"
"x36","the sand pits."
"x36",""
"x36","They seemed amazingly busy.  I began to ask myself what they could"
"x36","be.  Were they intelligent mechanisms?  Such a thing I felt was"
"x36","impossible.  Or did a Martian sit within each, ruling, directing,"
"x36","using, much as a man's brain sits and rules in his body?  I began to"
"x36","compare the things to human machines, to ask myself for the first time"
"x36","in my life how an ironclad or a steam engine would seem to an"
"x36","intelligent lower animal."
"x36",""
"x36","The storm had left the sky clear, and over the smoke of the burning"
"x36","land the little fading pinpoint of Mars was dropping into the west,"
"x36","when a soldier came into my garden.  I heard a slight scraping at the"
"x36","fence, and rousing myself from the lethargy that had fallen upon me, I"
"x36","looked down and saw him dimly, clambering over the palings.  At the"
"x36","sight of another human being my torpor passed, and I leaned out of the"
"x36","window eagerly."
"x36",""
"x36","""Hist!"" said I, in a whisper."
"x36",""
"x36","He stopped astride of the fence in doubt.  Then he came over and"
"x36","across the lawn to the corner of the house.  He bent down and stepped"
"x36","softly."
"x36",""
"x36","""Who's there?"" he said, also whispering, standing under the window"

"x36","""That's it."""

"x36",""
"x36","I went down, unfastened the door, and let him in, and locked the"
"x36","door again.  I could not see his face.  He was hatless, and his coat"
"x36","was unbuttoned."
"x36",""
"x36","""My God!"" he said, as I drew him in."
"x36",""
"x36","""What has happened?"" I asked."
"x36",""
"x36","""What hasn't?""  In the obscurity I could see he made a gesture of"
"x36","despair.  ""They wiped us out--simply wiped us out,"" he repeated again"
"x36","and again."
"x36",""
"x36","He followed me, almost mechanically, into the dining room."
"x36",""
"x36","""Take some whiskey,"" I said, pouring out a stiff dose."
"x36",""
"x36","He drank it.  Then abruptly he sat down before the table, put his"
"x36","head on his arms, and began to sob and weep like a little boy, in a"
"x36","perfect passion of emotion, while I, with a curious forgetfulness of"
"x36","my own recent despair, stood beside him, wondering."
"x36",""
"x36","It was a long time before he could steady his nerves to answer my"
"x36","questions, and then he answered perplexingly and brokenly.  He was a"
"x36","driver in the artillery, and had only come into action about seven.  At"
"x36","that time firing was going on across the common, and it was said the"
"x36","first party of Martians were crawling slowly towards their second"
"x36","cylinder under cover of a metal shield."
"x36",""
"x36","Later this shield staggered up on tripod legs and became the first"
"x36","of the fighting-machines I had seen.  The gun he drove had been"
"x36","unlimbered near Horsell, in order to command the sand pits, and its"
"x36","arrival it was that had precipitated the action.  As the limber"
"x36","gunners went to the rear, his horse trod in a rabbit hole and came"
"x36","down, throwing him into a depression of the ground.  At the same"
"x36","moment the gun exploded behind him, the ammunition blew up, there was"
"x36","fire all about him, and he found himself lying under a heap of charred"
"x36","dead men and dead horses."
"x36",""
"x36","""I lay still,"" he said, ""scared out of my wits, with the fore quarter"
"x36","of a horse atop of me.  We'd been wiped out.  And the smell--good"
"x36","God!  Like burnt meat!  I was hurt across the back by the fall of"
"x36","the horse, and there I had to lie until I felt better.  Just like"
"x36","parade it had been a minute before--then stumble, bang, swish!"""
"x36",""
"x36","""Wiped out!"" he said."
"x36",""
"x36","He had hid under the dead horse for a long time, peeping out"
"x36","furtively across the common.  The Cardigan men had tried a rush, in"
"x36","skirmishing order, at the pit, simply to be swept out of existence."
"x36","Then the monster had risen to its feet and had begun to walk leisurely"
"x36","to and fro across the common among the few fugitives, with its"
"x36","headlike hood turning about exactly like the head of a cowled human"
"x36","being.  A kind of arm carried a complicated metallic case, about which"
"x36","green flashes scintillated, and out of the funnel of this there smoked"
"x36","the Heat-Ray."

"x36","In a few minutes there was, so far as the soldier could see, not a"
"x36","living thing left upon the common, and every bush and tree upon it"
"x36","that was not already a blackened skeleton was burning.  The hussars"
"x36","had been on the road beyond the curvature of the ground, and he saw"
"x36","nothing of them.  He heard the Maxims rattle for a time and then"
"x36","become still.  The giant saved Woking station and its cluster of houses"
"x36","until the last; then in a moment the Heat-Ray was brought to bear, and"
"x36","the town became a heap of fiery ruins.  Then the Thing shut off the"
"x36","Heat-Ray, and turning its back upon the artilleryman, began to waddle"
"x36","away towards the smouldering pine woods that sheltered the second"
"x36","cylinder.  As it did so a second glittering Titan built itself up out"
"x36","of the pit."
"x36",""
"x36","The second monster followed the first, and at that the artilleryman"
"x36","began to crawl very cautiously across the hot heather ash towards"
"x36","Horsell.  He managed to get alive into the ditch by the side of the"
"x36","road, and so escaped to Woking.  There his story became ejaculatory."
"x36","The place was impassable.  It seems there were a few people alive"
"x36","there, frantic for the most part and many burned and scalded.  He was"
"x36","turned aside by the fire, and hid among some almost scorching heaps of"
"x36","broken wall as one of the Martian giants returned.  He saw this one"
"x36","pursue a man, catch him up in one of its steely tentacles, and knock"
"x36","his head against the trunk of a pine tree.  At last, after nightfall,"
"x36","the artilleryman made a rush for it and got over the railway"
"x36","embankment."
"x36",""
"x36","Since then he had been skulking along towards Maybury, in the hope"
"x36","of getting out of danger Londonward.  People were hiding in trenches"
"x36","and cellars, and many of the survivors had made off towards Woking"
"x36","village and Send.  He had been consumed with thirst until he found one"
"x36","of the water mains near the railway arch smashed, and the water"
"x36","bubbling out like a spring upon the road."
"x36",""
"x36","That was the story I got from him, bit by bit.  He grew calmer"
"x36","telling me and trying to make me see the things he had seen.  He had"
"x36","eaten no food since midday, he told me early in his narrative, and I"
"x36","found some mutton and bread in the pantry and brought it into the"
"x36","room.  We lit no lamp for fear of attracting the Martians, and ever"
"x36","and again our hands would touch upon bread or meat.  As he talked,"
"x36","things about us came darkly out of the darkness, and the trampled"
"x36","bushes and broken rose trees outside the window grew distinct.  It"
"x36","would seem that a number of men or animals had rushed across the lawn."
"x36","I began to see his face, blackened and haggard, as no doubt mine was"
"x36","also."
"x36",""
"x36","When we had finished eating we went softly upstairs to my study,"
"x36","and I looked again out of the open window.  In one night the valley"
"x36","had become a valley of ashes.  The fires had dwindled now.  Where"
"x36","flames had been there were now streamers of smoke; but the countless"
"x36","ruins of shattered and gutted houses and blasted and blackened trees"
"x36","that the night had hidden stood out now gaunt and terrible in the"
"x36","pitiless light of dawn.  Yet here and there some object had had the"
"x36","luck to escape--a white railway signal here, the end of a greenhouse"
"x36","there, white and fresh amid the wreckage.  Never before in the history"
"x36","of warfare had destruction been so indiscriminate and so universal."
"x36","And shining with the growing light of the east, three of the metallic"
"x36","giants stood about the pit, their cowls rotating as though they were"
"x36","surveying the desolation they had made."
"x36",""
"x36","It seemed to me that the pit had been enlarged, and ever and again"
"x36","puffs of vivid green vapour streamed up and out of it towards the"
"x36","brightening dawn--streamed up, whirled, broke, and vanished."
"x36",""
"x36","Beyond were the pillars of fire about Chobham.  They became pillars"
"x36","of bloodshot smoke at the first touch of day."

"x36","CHAPTER TWELVE"
"x36",""
"x36","WHAT I SAW OF THE DESTRUCTION OF WEYBRIDGE AND SHEPPERTON"
"x36",""
"x36",""
"x36","As the dawn grew brighter we withdrew from the window from which we"
"x36","had watched the Martians, and went very quietly downstairs."
"x36",""
"x36","The artilleryman agreed with me that the house was no place to stay"
"x36","in.  He proposed, he said, to make his way Londonward, and thence"
"x36","rejoin his battery--No. 12, of the Horse Artillery.  My plan was to"
"x36","return at once to Leatherhead; and so greatly had the strength of the"
"x36","Martians impressed me that I had determined to take my wife to"
"x36","Newhaven, and go with her out of the country forthwith.  For I already"
"x36","perceived clearly that the country about London must inevitably be the"
"x36","scene of a disastrous struggle before such creatures as these could be"
"x36","destroyed."
"x36",""
"x36","Between us and Leatherhead, however, lay the third cylinder, with"
"x36","its guarding giants.  Had I been alone, I think I should have taken my"
"x36","chance and struck across country.  But the artilleryman dissuaded me:"
"x36","""It's no kindness to the right sort of wife,"" he said, ""to make her a"
"x36","widow""; and in the end I agreed to go with him, under cover of the"
"x36","woods, northward as far as Street Cobham before I parted with him."
"x36","Thence I would make a big detour by Epsom to reach Leatherhead."
"x36",""
"x36","I should have started at once, but my companion had been in active"
"x36","service and he knew better than that.  He made me ransack the house"
"x36","for a flask, which he filled with whiskey; and we lined every"
"x36","available pocket with packets of biscuits and slices of meat.  Then"
"x36","we crept out of the house, and ran as quickly as we could down the"
"x36","ill-made road by which I had come overnight.  The houses seemed"
"x36","deserted. In the road lay a group of three charred bodies close"
"x36","together, struck dead by the Heat-Ray; and here and there were things"
"x36","that people had dropped--a clock, a slipper, a silver spoon, and the"
"x36","like poor valuables.  At the corner turning up towards the post"
"x36","office a little cart, filled with boxes and furniture, and horseless,"
"x36","heeled over on a broken wheel.  A cash box had been hastily smashed"
"x36","open and thrown under the debris."
"x36",""
"x36","Except the lodge at the Orphanage, which was still on fire, none of"
"x36","the houses had suffered very greatly here.  The Heat-Ray had shaved"
"x36","the chimney tops and passed.  Yet, save ourselves, there did not seem"
"x36","to be a living soul on Maybury Hill.  The majority of the inhabitants"
"x36","had escaped, I suppose, by way of the Old Woking road--the road I had"
"x36","taken when I drove to Leatherhead--or they had hidden."
"x36",""
"x36","We went down the lane, by the body of the man in black, sodden now"
"x36","from the overnight hail, and broke into the woods at the foot of the"
"x36","hill.  We pushed through these towards the railway without meeting a"
"x36","soul.  The woods across the line were but the scarred and blackened"
"x36","ruins of woods; for the most part the trees had fallen, but a certain"
"x36","proportion still stood, dismal grey stems, with dark brown foliage"
"x36","instead of green."
"x36",""
"x36","On our side the fire had done no more than scorch the nearer trees;"
"x36","it had failed to secure its footing.  In one place the woodmen had"
"x36","been at work on Saturday; trees, felled and freshly trimmed, lay in a"
"x36","clearing, with heaps of sawdust by the sawing-machine and its engine."
"x36","Hard by was a temporary hut, deserted.  There was not a breath of wind"
"x36","this morning, and everything was strangely still.  Even the birds were"
"x36","hushed, and as we hurried along I and the artilleryman talked in"
"x36","whispers and looked now and again over our shoulders.  Once or twice"
"x36","we stopped to listen."
"x36",""
"x36","After a time we drew near the road, and as we did so we heard the"
"x36","clatter of hoofs and saw through the tree stems three cavalry soldiers"
"x36","riding slowly towards Woking.  We hailed them, and they halted while"
"x36","we hurried towards them.  It was a lieutenant and a couple of privates"
"x36","of the 8th Hussars, with a stand like a theodolite, which the"
"x36","artilleryman told me was a heliograph."
"x36",""
"x36","""You are the first men I've seen coming this way this morning,"""
"x36","said the lieutenant.  ""What's brewing?"""
"x36",""
"x36","His voice and face were eager.  The men behind him stared"
"x36","curiously.  The artilleryman jumped down the bank into the road and"
"x36","saluted."
"x36",""
"x36","""Gun destroyed last night, sir.  Have been hiding.  Trying to"
"x36","rejoin battery, sir.  You'll come in sight of the Martians, I expect,"
"x36","about half a mile along this road."""
"x36",""
"x36","""What the dickens are they like?"" asked the lieutenant."
"x36",""
"x36","""Giants in armour, sir.  Hundred feet high.  Three legs and a body"
"x36","like 'luminium, with a mighty great head in a hood, sir."""
"x36",""
"x36","""Get out!"" said the lieutenant.  ""What confounded nonsense!"""
"x36",""
"x36","""You'll see, sir.  They carry a kind of box, sir, that shoots fire"
"x36","and strikes you dead."""
"x36",""
"x36","""What d'ye mean--a gun?"""
"x36",""
"x36","""No, sir,"" and the artilleryman began a vivid account of the Heat-Ray."
"x36","Halfway through, the lieutenant interrupted him and looked up at"
"x36","me.  I was still standing on the bank by the side of the road."
"x36",""
"x36","""It's perfectly true,"" I said."
"x36",""
"x36","""Well,"" said the lieutenant, ""I suppose it's my business to see it"
"x36","too.  Look here""--to the artilleryman--""we're detailed here clearing"
"x36","people out of their houses.  You'd better go along and report yourself"
"x36","to Brigadier-General Marvin, and tell him all you know.  He's at"
"x36","Weybridge.  Know the way?"""
"x36",""
"x36","""I do,"" I said; and he turned his horse southward again."
"x36",""
"x36","""Half a mile, you say?"" said he."
"x36",""
"x36","""At most,"" I answered, and pointed over the treetops southward.  He"
"x36","thanked me and rode on, and we saw them no more."
"x36",""
"x36","Farther along we came upon a group of three women and two children"
"x36","in the road, busy clearing out a labourer's cottage.  They had"
"x36","got hold of a little hand truck, and were piling it up with"
"x36","unclean-looking bundles and shabby furniture.  They were all too"
"x36","assiduously engaged to talk to us as we passed."
"x36",""
"x36","By Byfleet station we emerged from the pine trees, and found the"
"x36","country calm and peaceful under the morning sunlight.  We were far"
"x36","beyond the range of the Heat-Ray there, and had it not been for the"
"x36","silent desertion of some of the houses, the stirring movement of"
"x36","packing in others, and the knot of soldiers standing on the bridge"
"x36","over the railway and staring down the line towards Woking, the day"
"x36","would have seemed very like any other Sunday."
"x36",""
"x36","Several farm waggons and carts were moving creakily along the road"
"x36","to Addlestone, and suddenly through the gate of a field we saw, across"
"x36","a stretch of flat meadow, six twelve-pounders standing neatly at equal"
"x36","distances pointing towards Woking.  The gunners stood by the guns"
"x36","waiting, and the ammunition waggons were at a business-like distance."
"x36","The men stood almost as if under inspection."
"x36",""
"x36","""That's good!"" said I.  ""They will get one fair shot, at any rate."""
"x36",""
"x36","The artilleryman hesitated at the gate."
"x36",""
"x36","""I shall go on,"" he said."
"x36",""
"x36","Farther on towards Weybridge, just over the bridge, there were a"
"x36","number of men in white fatigue jackets throwing up a long rampart, and"
"x36","more guns behind."
"x36",""
"x36","""It's bows and arrows against the lightning, anyhow,"" said the"
"x36","artilleryman.  ""They 'aven't seen that fire-beam yet."""
"x36",""
"x36","The officers who were not actively engaged stood and stared over"
"x36","the treetops southwestward, and the men digging would stop every now"
"x36","and again to stare in the same direction."
"x36",""
"x36","Byfleet was in a tumult; people packing, and a score of hussars,"
"x36","some of them dismounted, some on horseback, were hunting them about."
"x36","Three or four black government waggons, with crosses in white circles,"
"x36","and an old omnibus, among other vehicles, were being loaded in the"
"x36","village street.  There were scores of people, most of them"
"x36","sufficiently sabbatical to have assumed their best clothes.  The"
"x36","soldiers were having the greatest difficulty in making them realise"
"x36","the gravity of their position.  We saw one shrivelled old fellow with"
"x36","a huge box and a score or more of flower pots containing orchids,"
"x36","angrily expostulating with the corporal who would leave them behind."
"x36","I stopped and gripped his arm."
"x36",""
"x36","""Do you know what's over there?"" I said, pointing at the pine tops"
"x36","that hid the Martians."
"x36",""
"x36","""Eh?"" said he, turning.  ""I was explainin' these is vallyble."""
"x36",""
"x36","""Death!"" I shouted.  ""Death is coming!  Death!"" and leaving him to"
"x36","digest that if he could, I hurried on after the artillery-man.  At the"
"x36","corner I looked back.  The soldier had left him, and he was still"
"x36","standing by his box, with the pots of orchids on the lid of it, and"
"x36","staring vaguely over the trees."
"x36",""
"x36","No one in Weybridge could tell us where the headquarters were"
"x36","established; the whole place was in such confusion as I had never seen"
"x36","in any town before.  Carts, carriages everywhere, the most astonishing"
"x36","miscellany of conveyances and horseflesh.  The respectable inhabitants"
"x36","of the place, men in golf and boating costumes, wives prettily"
"x36","dressed, were packing, river-side loafers energetically helping,"
"x36","children excited, and, for the most part, highly delighted at this"
"x36","astonishing variation of their Sunday experiences.  In the midst of it"
"x36","all the worthy vicar was very pluckily holding an early celebration,"
"x36","and his bell was jangling out above the excitement."
"x36",""
"x36","I and the artilleryman, seated on the step of the drinking"
"x36","fountain, made a very passable meal upon what we had brought with"
"x36","us. Patrols of soldiers--here no longer hussars, but grenadiers in"
"x36","white--were warning people to move now or to take refuge in their"
"x36","cellars as soon as the firing began.  We saw as we crossed the"
"x36","railway bridge that a growing crowd of people had assembled in and"
"x36","about the railway station, and the swarming platform was piled with"
"x36","boxes and packages. The ordinary traffic had been stopped, I believe,"
"x36","in order to allow of the passage of troops and guns to Chertsey, and"
"x36","I have heard since that a savage struggle occurred for places in the"
"x36","special trains that were put on at a later hour."
"x36",""
"x36","We remained at Weybridge until midday, and at that hour we found"
"x36","ourselves at the place near Shepperton Lock where the Wey and Thames"
"x36","join.  Part of the time we spent helping two old women to pack a"
"x36","little cart.  The Wey has a treble mouth, and at this point boats are"
"x36","to be hired, and there was a ferry across the river.  On the"
"x36","Shepperton side was an inn with a lawn, and beyond that the tower of"
"x36","Shepperton Church--it has been replaced by a spire--rose above the"
"x36","trees."
"x36",""
"x36","Here we found an excited and noisy crowd of fugitives.  As yet the"
"x36","flight had not grown to a panic, but there were already far more"
"x36","people than all the boats going to and fro could enable to cross."
"x36","People came panting along under heavy burdens; one husband and wife"
"x36","were even carrying a small outhouse door between them, with some of"
"x36","their household goods piled thereon.  One man told us he meant to try"
"x36","to get away from Shepperton station."
"x36",""
"x36","There was a lot of shouting, and one man was even jesting.  The idea"
"x36","people seemed to have here was that the Martians were simply"
"x36","formidable human beings, who might attack and sack the town, to be"
"x36","certainly destroyed in the end.  Every now and then people would"
"x36","glance nervously across the Wey, at the meadows towards Chertsey, but"
"x36","everything over there was still."
"x36",""
"x36","Across the Thames, except just where the boats landed, everything"
"x36","was quiet, in vivid contrast with the Surrey side.  The people who"
"x36","landed there from the boats went tramping off down the lane.  The big"
"x36","ferryboat had just made a journey.  Three or four soldiers stood on"
"x36","the lawn of the inn, staring and jesting at the fugitives, without"
"x36","offering to help.  The inn was closed, as it was now within prohibited"
"x36","hours."
"x36",""
"x36","""What's that?"" cried a boatman, and ""Shut up, you fool!"" said a man"
"x36","near me to a yelping dog.  Then the sound came again, this time from"
"x36","the direction of Chertsey, a muffled thud--the sound of a gun."
"x36",""
"x36","The fighting was beginning.  Almost immediately unseen batteries"
"x36","across the river to our right, unseen because of the trees, took up"
"x36","the chorus, firing heavily one after the other.  A woman screamed."
"x36","Everyone stood arrested by the sudden stir of battle, near us and yet"
"x36","invisible to us.  Nothing was to be seen save flat meadows, cows"
"x36","feeding unconcernedly for the most part, and silvery pollard willows"
"x36","motionless in the warm sunlight."
"x36",""
"x36","""The sojers'll stop 'em,"" said a woman beside me, doubtfully.  A"
"x36","haziness rose over the treetops."
"x36",""
"x36","Then suddenly we saw a rush of smoke far away up the river, a puff"
"x36","of smoke that jerked up into the air and hung; and forthwith the"
"x36","ground heaved under foot and a heavy explosion shook the air, smashing"
"x36","two or three windows in the houses near, and leaving us astonished."
"x36",""
"x36","""Here they are!"" shouted a man in a blue jersey.  ""Yonder! D'yer"
"x36","see them?  Yonder!"""
"x36",""
"x36","Quickly, one after the other, one, two, three, four of the armoured"
"x36","Martians appeared, far away over the little trees, across the flat"
"x36","meadows that stretched towards Chertsey, and striding hurriedly"
"x36","towards the river.  Little cowled figures they seemed at first, going"
"x36","with a rolling motion and as fast as flying birds."
"x36",""
"x36","Then, advancing obliquely towards us, came a fifth.  Their armoured"
"x36","bodies glittered in the sun as they swept swiftly forward upon the"
"x36","guns, growing rapidly larger as they drew nearer.  One on the extreme"
"x36","left, the remotest that is, flourished a huge case high in the air,"
"x36","and the ghostly, terrible Heat-Ray I had already seen on Friday night"
"x36","smote towards Chertsey, and struck the town."
"x36",""
"x36","At sight of these strange, swift, and terrible creatures the crowd"
"x36","near the water's edge seemed to me to be for a moment horror-struck."
"x36","There was no screaming or shouting, but a silence.  Then a hoarse"
"x36","murmur and a movement of feet--a splashing from the water.  A man, too"
"x36","frightened to drop the portmanteau he carried on his shoulder, swung"
"x36","round and sent me staggering with a blow from the corner of his"
"x36","burden.  A woman thrust at me with her hand and rushed past me.  I"
"x36","turned with the rush of the people, but I was not too terrified for"
"x36","thought.  The terrible Heat-Ray was in my mind.  To get under water!"
"x36","That was it!"
"x36",""
"x36","""Get under water!"" I shouted, unheeded."
"x36",""
"x36","I faced about again, and rushed towards the approaching Martian,"
"x36","rushed right down the gravelly beach and headlong into the water."
"x36","Others did the same.  A boatload of people putting back came leaping"
"x36","out as I rushed past.  The stones under my feet were muddy and"
"x36","slippery, and the river was so low that I ran perhaps twenty feet"
"x36","scarcely waist-deep.  Then, as the Martian towered overhead scarcely"
"x36","a couple of hundred yards away, I flung myself forward under the"
"x36","surface.  The splashes of the people in the boats leaping into the"
"x36","river sounded like thunderclaps in my ears.  People were landing"
"x36","hastily on both sides of the river.  But the Martian machine took no"
"x36","more notice for the moment of the people running this way and that"
"x36","than a man would of the confusion of ants in a nest against which his"
"x36","foot has kicked.  When, half suffocated, I raised my head above water,"
"x36","the Martian's hood pointed at the batteries that were still firing"
"x36","across the river, and as it advanced it swung loose what must have"
"x36","been the generator of the Heat-Ray."
"x36",""
"x36","In another moment it was on the bank, and in a stride wading"
"x36","halfway across.  The knees of its foremost legs bent at the farther"
"x36","bank, and in another moment it had raised itself to its full height"
"x36","again, close to the village of Shepperton.  Forthwith the six guns"
"x36","which, unknown to anyone on the right bank, had been hidden behind the"
"x36","outskirts of that village, fired simultaneously.  The sudden near"
"x36","concussion, the last close upon the first, made my heart jump.  The"
"x36","monster was already raising the case generating the Heat-Ray as the"
"x36","first shell burst six yards above the hood."
"x36",""
"x36","I gave a cry of astonishment.  I saw and thought nothing of the"
"x36","other four Martian monsters; my attention was riveted upon the nearer"
"x36","incident.  Simultaneously two other shells burst in the air near the"
"x36","body as the hood twisted round in time to receive, but not in time to"
"x36","dodge, the fourth shell."
"x36",""
"x36","The shell burst clean in the face of the Thing.  The hood bulged,"
"x36","flashed, was whirled off in a dozen tattered fragments of red flesh"
"x36","and glittering metal."
"x36",""
"x36","""Hit!"" shouted I, with something between a scream and a cheer."
"x36",""
"x36","I heard answering shouts from the people in the water about me.  I"
"x36","could have leaped out of the water with that momentary exultation."
"x36",""
"x36","The decapitated colossus reeled like a drunken giant; but it did"
"x36","not fall over.  It recovered its balance by a miracle, and, no longer"
"x36","heeding its steps and with the camera that fired the Heat-Ray now"
"x36","rigidly upheld, it reeled swiftly upon Shepperton.  The living"
"x36","intelligence, the Martian within the hood, was slain and splashed to"
"x36","the four winds of heaven, and the Thing was now but a mere intricate"
"x36","device of metal whirling to destruction.  It drove along in a straight"
"x36","line, incapable of guidance.  It struck the tower of Shepperton"
"x36","Church, smashing it down as the impact of a battering ram might have"
"x36","done, swerved aside, blundered on and collapsed with tremendous force"
"x36","into the river out of my sight."
"x36",""
"x36","A violent explosion shook the air, and a spout of water, steam,"
"x36","mud, and shattered metal shot far up into the sky.  As the camera of"
"x36","the Heat-Ray hit the water, the latter had immediately flashed into"
"x36","steam.  In another moment a huge wave, like a muddy tidal bore but"
"x36","almost scaldingly hot, came sweeping round the bend upstream.  I saw"
"x36","people struggling shorewards, and heard their screaming and shouting"
"x36","faintly above the seething and roar of the Martian's collapse."
"x36",""
"x36","For a moment I heeded nothing of the heat, forgot the patent need"
"x36","of self-preservation.  I splashed through the tumultuous water,"
"x36","pushing aside a man in black to do so, until I could see round the"
"x36","bend.  Half a dozen deserted boats pitched aimlessly upon the"
"x36","confusion of the waves.  The fallen Martian came into sight"
"x36","downstream, lying across the river, and for the most part submerged."
"x36",""
"x36","Thick clouds of steam were pouring off the wreckage, and through"
"x36","the tumultuously whirling wisps I could see, intermittently and"
"x36","vaguely, the gigantic limbs churning the water and flinging a splash"
"x36","and spray of mud and froth into the air.  The tentacles swayed and"
"x36","struck like living arms, and, save for the helpless purposelessness of"
"x36","these movements, it was as if some wounded thing were struggling for"
"x36","its life amid the waves.  Enormous quantities of a ruddy-brown fluid"
"x36","were spurting up in noisy jets out of the machine."
"x36",""
"x36","My attention was diverted from this death flurry by a furious"
"x36","yelling, like that of the thing called a siren in our manufacturing"
"x36","towns.  A man, knee-deep near the towing path, shouted inaudibly to me"
"x36","and pointed.  Looking back, I saw the other Martians advancing with"
"x36","gigantic strides down the riverbank from the direction of Chertsey."
"x36","The Shepperton guns spoke this time unavailingly."
"x36",""
"x36","At that I ducked at once under water, and, holding my breath until"
"x36","movement was an agony, blundered painfully ahead under the surface as"
"x36","long as I could.  The water was in a tumult about me, and rapidly"
"x36","growing hotter."
"x36",""
"x36","When for a moment I raised my head to take breath and throw the"
"x36","hair and water from my eyes, the steam was rising in a whirling white"
"x36","fog that at first hid the Martians altogether.  The noise was"
"x36","deafening.  Then I saw them dimly, colossal figures of grey, magnified"
"x36","by the mist.  They had passed by me, and two were stooping over the"
"x36","frothing, tumultuous ruins of their comrade."
"x36",""
"x36","The third and fourth stood beside him in the water, one perhaps two"
"x36","hundred yards from me, the other towards Laleham.  The generators of"
"x36","the Heat-Rays waved high, and the hissing beams smote down this way"
"x36","and that."
"x36",""
"x36","The air was full of sound, a deafening and confusing conflict of"
"x36","noises--the clangorous din of the Martians, the crash of falling"
"x36","houses, the thud of trees, fences, sheds flashing into flame, and the"
"x36","crackling and roaring of fire.  Dense black smoke was leaping up to"
"x36","mingle with the steam from the river, and as the Heat-Ray went to and"
"x36","fro over Weybridge its impact was marked by flashes of incandescent"
"x36","white, that gave place at once to a smoky dance of lurid flames.  The"
"x36","nearer houses still stood intact, awaiting their fate, shadowy, faint"
"x36","and pallid in the steam, with the fire behind them going to and fro."
"x36",""
"x36","For a moment perhaps I stood there, breast-high in the almost"
"x36","boiling water, dumbfounded at my position, hopeless of escape.  Through"
"x36","the reek I could see the people who had been with me in the river"
"x36","scrambling out of the water through the reeds, like little frogs"
"x36","hurrying through grass from the advance of a man, or running to and"
"x36","fro in utter dismay on the towing path."
"x36",""
"x36","Then suddenly the white flashes of the Heat-Ray came leaping"
"x36","towards me.  The houses caved in as they dissolved at its touch, and"
"x36","darted out flames; the trees changed to fire with a roar.  The Ray"
"x36","flickered up and down the towing path, licking off the people who ran"
"x36","this way and that, and came down to the water's edge not fifty yards"
"x36","from where I stood.  It swept across the river to Shepperton, and the"
"x36","water in its track rose in a boiling weal crested with steam.  I"
"x36","turned shoreward."
"x36",""
"x36","In another moment the huge wave, well-nigh at the boiling-point had"
"x36","rushed upon me.  I screamed aloud, and scalded, half blinded,"
"x36","agonised, I staggered through the leaping, hissing water towards the"
"x36","shore.  Had my foot stumbled, it would have been the end.  I fell"
"x36","helplessly, in full sight of the Martians, upon the broad, bare"
"x36","gravelly spit that runs down to mark the angle of the Wey and Thames."
"x36","I expected nothing but death."
"x36",""
"x36","I have a dim memory of the foot of a Martian coming down within a"
"x36","score of yards of my head, driving straight into the loose gravel,"
"x36","whirling it this way and that and lifting again; of a long suspense,"
"x36","and then of the four carrying the debris of their comrade between"
"x36","them, now clear and then presently faint through a veil of smoke,"
"x36","receding interminably, as it seemed to me, across a vast space of"
"x36","river and meadow.  And then, very slowly, I realised that by a miracle"
"x36","I had escaped."

"x36","CHAPTER THIRTEEN"
"x36",""
"x36","HOW I FELL IN WITH THE CURATE"
"x36",""
"x36",""
"x36","After getting this sudden lesson in the power of terrestrial"
"x36","weapons, the Martians retreated to their original position upon"
"x36","Horsell Common; and in their haste, and encumbered with the debris of"
"x36","their smashed companion, they no doubt overlooked many such a stray"
"x36","and negligible victim as myself.  Had they left their comrade and"
"x36","pushed on forthwith, there was nothing at that time between them and"
"x36","London but batteries of twelve-pounder guns, and they would certainly"
"x36","have reached the capital in advance of the tidings of their approach;"
"x36","as sudden, dreadful, and destructive their advent would have been as"
"x36","the earthquake that destroyed Lisbon a century ago."
"x36",""
"x36","But they were in no hurry.  Cylinder followed cylinder on its"
"x36","interplanetary flight; every twenty-four hours brought them"
"x36","reinforcement.  And meanwhile the military and naval authorities, now"
"x36","fully alive to the tremendous power of their antagonists, worked with"
"x36","furious energy.  Every minute a fresh gun came into position until,"
"x36","before twilight, every copse, every row of suburban villas on the"
"x36","hilly slopes about Kingston and Richmond, masked an expectant black"
"x36","muzzle.  And through the charred and desolated area--perhaps twenty"
"x36","square miles altogether--that encircled the Martian encampment on"
"x36","Horsell Common, through charred and ruined villages among the green"
"x36","trees, through the blackened and smoking arcades that had been but a"
"x36","day ago pine spinneys, crawled the devoted scouts with the heliographs"
"x36","that were presently to warn the gunners of the Martian approach.  But"
"x36","the Martians now understood our command of artillery and the danger of"
"x36","human proximity, and not a man ventured within a mile of either"
"x36","cylinder, save at the price of his life."
"x36",""
"x36","It would seem that these giants spent the earlier part of the"
"x36","afternoon in going to and fro, transferring everything from the second"
"x36","and third cylinders--the second in Addlestone Golf Links and the third"
"x36","at Pyrford--to their original pit on Horsell Common.  Over that, above"
"x36","the blackened heather and ruined buildings that stretched far and"
"x36","wide, stood one as sentinel, while the rest abandoned their vast"
"x36","fighting-machines and descended into the pit.  They were hard at work"
"x36","there far into the night, and the towering pillar of dense green smoke"
"x36","that rose therefrom could be seen from the hills about Merrow, and"
"x36","even, it is said, from Banstead and Epsom Downs."
"x36",""
"x36","And while the Martians behind me were thus preparing for their next"
"x36","sally, and in front of me Humanity gathered for the battle, I made my"
"x36","way with infinite pains and labour from the fire and smoke of burning"
"x36","Weybridge towards London."
"x36",""
"x36","I saw an abandoned boat, very small and remote, drifting down-stream;"
"x36","and throwing off the most of my sodden clothes, I went after it,"
"x36","gained it, and so escaped out of that destruction.  There were no"
"x36","oars in the boat, but I contrived to paddle, as well as my parboiled"
"x36","hands would allow, down the river towards Halliford and Walton, going"
"x36","very tediously and continually looking behind me, as you may well"
"x36","understand.  I followed the river, because I considered that the water"
"x36","gave me my best chance of escape should these giants return."
"x36",""
"x36","The hot water from the Martian's overthrow drifted downstream with"
"x36","me, so that for the best part of a mile I could see little of either"
"x36","bank.  Once, however, I made out a string of black figures hurrying"
"x36","across the meadows from the direction of Weybridge.  Halliford, it"
"x36","seemed, was deserted, and several of the houses facing the river were"
"x36","on fire.  It was strange to see the place quite tranquil, quite"
"x36","desolate under the hot blue sky, with the smoke and little threads of"
"x36","flame going straight up into the heat of the afternoon.  Never before"
"x36","had I seen houses burning without the accompaniment of an obstructive"
"x36","crowd.  A little farther on the dry reeds up the bank were smoking and"
"x36","glowing, and a line of fire inland was marching steadily across a late"
"x36","field of hay."
"x36",""
"x36","For a long time I drifted, so painful and weary was I after the"
"x36","violence I had been through, and so intense the heat upon the water."
"x36","Then my fears got the better of me again, and I resumed my paddling."
"x36","The sun scorched my bare back.  At last, as the bridge at Walton was"
"x36","coming into sight round the bend, my fever and faintness overcame my"
"x36","fears, and I landed on the Middlesex bank and lay down, deadly sick,"
"x36","amid the long grass.  I suppose the time was then about four or five"
"x36","o'clock.  I got up presently, walked perhaps half a mile without"
"x36","meeting a soul, and then lay down again in the shadow of a hedge.  I"
"x36","seem to remember talking, wanderingly, to myself during that last"
"x36","spurt.  I was also very thirsty, and bitterly regretful I had drunk no"
"x36","more water.  It is a curious thing that I felt angry with my wife; I"
"x36","cannot account for it, but my impotent desire to reach Leatherhead"
"x36","worried me excessively."
"x36",""
"x36","I do not clearly remember the arrival of the curate, so that probably"
"x36","I dozed.  I became aware of him as a seated figure in soot-smudged"
"x36","shirt sleeves, and with his upturned, clean-shaven face staring at"
"x36","a faint flickering that danced over the sky.  The sky was what is"
"x36","called a mackerel sky--rows and rows of faint down-plumes of"
"x36","cloud, just tinted with the midsummer sunset."
"x36",""
"x36","I sat up, and at the rustle of my motion he looked at me quickly."
"x36",""
"x36","""Have you any water?"" I asked abruptly."
"x36",""
"x36","He shook his head."
"x36",""
"x36","""You have been asking for water for the last hour,"" he said."
"x36",""
"x36","For a moment we were silent, taking stock of each other.  I"
"x36","dare say he found me a strange enough figure, naked, save for my"
"x36","water-soaked trousers and socks, scalded, and my face and shoulders"
"x36","blackened by the smoke.  His face was a fair weakness, his chin"
"x36","retreated, and his hair lay in crisp, almost flaxen curls on his low"
"x36","forehead; his eyes were rather large, pale blue, and blankly staring."
"x36","He spoke abruptly, looking vacantly away from me."
"x36",""
"x36","""What does it mean?"" he said.  ""What do these things mean?"""
"x36",""
"x36","I stared at him and made no answer."

"x36",""
"x36","""Why are these things permitted?  What sins have we done?  The"
"x36","morning service was over, I was walking through the roads to clear my"

"x36","were Sodom and Gomorrah!  All our work undone, all the work---- What"
"x36","are these Martians?"""
"x36",""
"x36","""What are we?"" I answered, clearing my throat."
"x36",""
"x36","He gripped his knees and turned to look at me again.  For half a"
"x36","minute, perhaps, he stared silently."
"x36",""
"x36","""I was walking through the roads to clear my brain,"" he said.  ""And"
"x36","suddenly--fire, earthquake, death!"""
"x36",""
"x36","He relapsed into silence, with his chin now sunken almost to his"

"x36","Presently he began waving his hand."
"x36",""
"x36","""All the work--all the Sunday schools--What have we done--what has"

"x36","We rebuilt it only three years ago.  Gone!  Swept out of existence!"
"x36","Why?"""
"x36",""
"x36","Another pause, and he broke out again like one demented."
"x36",""
"x36","""The smoke of her burning goeth up for ever and ever!"" he shouted."
"x36",""
"x36","His eyes flamed, and he pointed a lean finger in the direction of"
"x36","Weybridge."
"x36",""
"x36","By this time I was beginning to take his measure.  The tremendous"
"x36","tragedy in which he had been involved--it was evident he was a"
"x36","fugitive from Weybridge--had driven him to the very verge of his"
"x36","reason."
"x36",""
"x36","""Are we far from Sunbury?"" I said, in a matter-of-fact tone."
"x36",""
"x36","""What are we to do?"" he asked.  ""Are these creatures everywhere?"
"x36","Has the earth been given over to them?"""
"x36",""
"x36","""Are we far from Sunbury?"""
"x36",""
"x36","""Only this morning I officiated at early celebration----"""

"x36",""
"x36","""Hope!"""
"x36",""
"x36","""Yes.  Plentiful hope--for all this destruction!"""
"x36",""
"x36","I began to explain my view of our position.  He listened at first,"
"x36","but as I went on the interest dawning in his eyes gave place to their"
"x36","former stare, and his regard wandered from me."
"x36",""
"x36","""This must be the beginning of the end,"" he said, interrupting me."

"x36","them--hide them from the face of Him that sitteth upon the throne!"""
"x36",""
"x36","I began to understand the position.  I ceased my laboured"
"x36","reasoning, struggled to my feet, and, standing over him, laid my hand"
"x36","on his shoulder."
"x36",""
"x36","""Be a man!"" said I.  ""You are scared out of your wits!  What good"
"x36","is religion if it collapses under calamity?  Think of what earthquakes"
"x36","and floods, wars and volcanoes, have done before to men!  Did you"
"x36","think God had exempted Weybridge?  He is not an insurance agent."""
"x36",""
"x36","For a time he sat in blank silence."

"x36","""But how can we escape?"" he asked, suddenly.  ""They are"
"x36","invulnerable, they are pitiless."""
"x36",""
"x36","""Neither the one nor, perhaps, the other,"" I answered. ""And the"

"x36","CHAPTER FOURTEEN"
"x36",""
"x36","IN LONDON"
"x36",""
"x36",""
"x36","My younger brother was in London when the Martians fell at Woking."
"x36","He was a medical student working for an imminent examination, and he"
"x36","heard nothing of the arrival until Saturday morning.  The morning"
"x36","papers on Saturday contained, in addition to lengthy special articles"
"x36","on the planet Mars, on life in the planets, and so forth, a brief and"
"x36","vaguely worded telegram, all the more striking for its brevity."
"x36",""
"x36","The Martians, alarmed by the approach of a crowd, had killed a"
"x36","number of people with a quick-firing gun, so the story ran.  The"
"x36","telegram concluded with the words: ""Formidable as they seem to be, the"
"x36","Martians have not moved from the pit into which they have fallen, and,"
"x36","indeed, seem incapable of doing so.  Probably this is due to the"
"x36","relative strength of the earth's gravitational energy.""  On that last"
"x36","text their leader-writer expanded very comfortingly."
"x36",""
"x36","Of course all the students in the crammer's biology class, to which"
"x36","my brother went that day, were intensely interested, but there were no"
"x36","signs of any unusual excitement in the streets.  The afternoon papers"
"x36","puffed scraps of news under big headlines.  They had nothing to tell"
"x36","beyond the movements of troops about the common, and the burning of"
"x36","the pine woods between Woking and Weybridge, until eight.  Then the"
"x36","_St. James's Gazette_, in an extra-special edition, announced the bare"
"x36","fact of the interruption of telegraphic communication.  This was"
"x36","thought to be due to the falling of burning pine trees across the"
"x36","line.  Nothing more of the fighting was known that night, the night of"
"x36","my drive to Leatherhead and back."
"x36",""
"x36","My brother felt no anxiety about us, as he knew from the"
"x36","description in the papers that the cylinder was a good two miles from"
"x36","my house.  He made up his mind to run down that night to me, in order,"
"x36","as he says, to see the Things before they were killed.  He dispatched"
"x36","a telegram, which never reached me, about four o'clock, and spent the"
"x36","evening at a music hall."
"x36",""
"x36","In London, also, on Saturday night there was a thunderstorm, and my"
"x36","brother reached Waterloo in a cab.  On the platform from which the"
"x36","midnight train usually starts he learned, after some waiting, that an"
"x36","accident prevented trains from reaching Woking that night.  The nature"
"x36","of the accident he could not ascertain; indeed, the railway"
"x36","authorities did not clearly know at that time.  There was very little"
"x36","excitement in the station, as the officials, failing to realise that"
"x36","anything further than a breakdown between Byfleet and Woking junction"
"x36","had occurred, were running the theatre trains which usually passed"
"x36","through Woking round by Virginia Water or Guildford.  They were busy"
"x36","making the necessary arrangements to alter the route of the"
"x36","Southampton and Portsmouth Sunday League excursions.  A nocturnal"
"x36","newspaper reporter, mistaking my brother for the traffic manager, to"
"x36","whom he bears a slight resemblance, waylaid and tried to interview"
"x36","him.  Few people, excepting the railway officials, connected the"
"x36","breakdown with the Martians."
"x36",""
"x36","I have read, in another account of these events, that on Sunday"
"x36","morning ""all London was electrified by the news from Woking.""  As a"
"x36","matter of fact, there was nothing to justify that very extravagant"
"x36","phrase.  Plenty of Londoners did not hear of the Martians until the"
"x36","panic of Monday morning.  Those who did took some time to realise all"
"x36","that the hastily worded telegrams in the Sunday papers conveyed.  The"
"x36","majority of people in London do not read Sunday papers."
"x36",""
"x36","The habit of personal security, moreover, is so deeply fixed in the"
"x36","Londoner's mind, and startling intelligence so much a matter of course"
"x36","in the papers, that they could read without any personal tremors:"
"x36","""About seven o'clock last night the Martians came out of the cylinder,"
"x36","and, moving about under an armour of metallic shields, have completely"
"x36","wrecked Woking station with the adjacent houses, and massacred an"
"x36","entire battalion of the Cardigan Regiment.  No details are known."
"x36","Maxims have been absolutely useless against their armour; the field"
"x36","guns have been disabled by them.  Flying hussars have been galloping"
"x36","into Chertsey.  The Martians appear to be moving slowly towards"
"x36","Chertsey or Windsor.  Great anxiety prevails in West Surrey, and"
"x36","earthworks are being thrown up to check the advance Londonward.""  That"
"x36","was how the Sunday _Sun_ put it, and a clever and remarkably prompt"
"x36","""handbook"" article in the _Referee_ compared the affair to a menagerie"
"x36","suddenly let loose in a village."
"x36",""
"x36","No one in London knew positively of the nature of the armoured"
"x36","Martians, and there was still a fixed idea that these monsters must be"
"x36","sluggish: ""crawling,"" ""creeping painfully""--such expressions occurred"
"x36","in almost all the earlier reports.  None of the telegrams could have"
"x36","been written by an eyewitness of their advance.  The Sunday papers"
"x36","printed separate editions as further news came to hand, some even in"
"x36","default of it.  But there was practically nothing more to tell people"
"x36","until late in the afternoon, when the authorities gave the press"
"x36","agencies the news in their possession.  It was stated that the people"
"x36","of Walton and Weybridge, and all the district were pouring along the"
"x36","roads Londonward, and that was all."
"x36",""
"x36","My brother went to church at the Foundling Hospital in the morning,"
"x36","still in ignorance of what had happened on the previous night.  There"
"x36","he heard allusions made to the invasion, and a special prayer for"
"x36","peace.  Coming out, he bought a _Referee_.  He became alarmed at the"
"x36","news in this, and went again to Waterloo station to find out if"
"x36","communication were restored.  The omnibuses, carriages, cyclists, and"
"x36","innumerable people walking in their best clothes seemed scarcely"
"x36","affected by the strange intelligence that the news venders were"
"x36","disseminating.  People were interested, or, if alarmed, alarmed only"
"x36","on account of the local residents.  At the station he heard for the"
"x36","first time that the Windsor and Chertsey lines were now interrupted."
"x36","The porters told him that several remarkable telegrams had been"
"x36","received in the morning from Byfleet and Chertsey stations, but that"
"x36","these had abruptly ceased.  My brother could get very little precise"
"x36","detail out of them."
"x36",""
"x36","""There's fighting going on about Weybridge"" was the extent of their"
"x36","information."
"x36",""
"x36","The train service was now very much disorganised.  Quite a number"
"x36","of people who had been expecting friends from places on the"
"x36","South-Western network were standing about the station.  One"
"x36","grey-headed old gentleman came and abused the South-Western Company"
"x36","bitterly to my brother.  ""It wants showing up,"" he said."
"x36",""
"x36","One or two trains came in from Richmond, Putney, and Kingston,"
"x36","containing people who had gone out for a day's boating and found the"

"x36","ill-tempered."
"x36",""
"x36","About five o'clock the gathering crowd in the station was immensely"
"x36","excited by the opening of the line of communication, which is almost"
"x36","invariably closed, between the South-Eastern and the South-Western"
"x36","stations, and the passage of carriage trucks bearing huge guns and"
"x36","carriages crammed with soldiers.  These were the guns that were"
"x36","brought up from Woolwich and Chatham to cover Kingston.  There was"
"x36","an exchange of pleasantries: ""You'll get eaten!""  ""We're the"
"x36","beast-tamers!"" and so forth.  A little while after that a squad of"
"x36","police came into the station and began to clear the public off the"
"x36","platforms, and my brother went out into the street again."
"x36",""
"x36","The church bells were ringing for evensong, and a squad of"
"x36","Salvation Army lassies came singing down Waterloo Road.  On the bridge"
"x36","a number of loafers were watching a curious brown scum that came"
"x36","drifting down the stream in patches.  The sun was just setting, and the"
"x36","Clock Tower and the Houses of Parliament rose against one of the most"
"x36","peaceful skies it is possible to imagine, a sky of gold, barred with"
"x36","long transverse stripes of reddish-purple cloud.  There was talk of a"
"x36","floating body.  One of the men there, a reservist he said he was, told"
"x36","my brother he had seen the heliograph flickering in the west."
"x36",""
"x36","In Wellington Street my brother met a couple of sturdy roughs who"
"x36","had just been rushed out of Fleet Street with still-wet newspapers and"
"x36","staring placards.  ""Dreadful catastrophe!"" they bawled one to the"
"x36","other down Wellington Street.  ""Fighting at Weybridge!  Full"
"x36","description!  Repulse of the Martians! London in Danger!""  He had to"
"x36","give threepence for a copy of that paper."
"x36",""
"x36","Then it was, and then only, that he realised something of the full"
"x36","power and terror of these monsters.  He learned that they were not"
"x36","merely a handful of small sluggish creatures, but that they were minds"
"x36","swaying vast mechanical bodies; and that they could move swiftly and"
"x36","smite with such power that even the mightiest guns could not stand"
"x36","against them."
"x36",""
"x36","They were described as ""vast spiderlike machines, nearly a hundred"
"x36","feet high, capable of the speed of an express train, and able to shoot"
"x36","out a beam of intense heat.""  Masked batteries, chiefly of field guns,"
"x36","had been planted in the country about Horsell Common, and especially"
"x36","between the Woking district and London.  Five of the machines had been"
"x36","seen moving towards the Thames, and one, by a happy chance, had been"
"x36","destroyed.  In the other cases the shells had missed, and the"
"x36","batteries had been at once annihilated by the Heat-Rays.  Heavy"
"x36","losses of soldiers were mentioned, but the tone of the dispatch was"
"x36","optimistic."
"x36",""
"x36","The Martians had been repulsed; they were not invulnerable.  They"
"x36","had retreated to their triangle of cylinders again, in the circle"
"x36","about Woking.  Signallers with heliographs were pushing forward upon"
"x36","them from all sides.  Guns were in rapid transit from Windsor,"
"x36","Portsmouth, Aldershot, Woolwich--even from the north; among others,"
"x36","long wire-guns of ninety-five tons from Woolwich.  Altogether one"
"x36","hundred and sixteen were in position or being hastily placed, chiefly"
"x36","covering London.  Never before in England had there been such a vast"
"x36","or rapid concentration of military material."
"x36",""
"x36","Any further cylinders that fell, it was hoped, could be destroyed"
"x36","at once by high explosives, which were being rapidly manufactured and"
"x36","distributed.  No doubt, ran the report, the situation was of the"
"x36","strangest and gravest description, but the public was exhorted to"
"x36","avoid and discourage panic.  No doubt the Martians were strange and"
"x36","terrible in the extreme, but at the outside there could not be more"
"x36","than twenty of them against our millions."
"x36",""
"x36","The authorities had reason to suppose, from the size of the"
"x36","cylinders, that at the outside there could not be more than five in"
"x36","each cylinder--fifteen altogether.  And one at least was disposed"
"x36","of--perhaps more.  The public would be fairly warned of the approach"
"x36","of danger, and elaborate measures were being taken for the protection"
"x36","of the people in the threatened southwestern suburbs.  And so, with"
"x36","reiterated assurances of the safety of London and the ability of the"
"x36","authorities to cope with the difficulty, this quasi-proclamation"
"x36","closed."
"x36",""
"x36","This was printed in enormous type on paper so fresh that it was"
"x36","still wet, and there had been no time to add a word of comment.  It"
"x36","was curious, my brother said, to see how ruthlessly the usual contents"
"x36","of the paper had been hacked and taken out to give this place."
"x36",""
"x36","All down Wellington Street people could be seen fluttering out the"
"x36","pink sheets and reading, and the Strand was suddenly noisy with the"
"x36","voices of an army of hawkers following these pioneers.  Men came"
"x36","scrambling off buses to secure copies.  Certainly this news excited"
"x36","people intensely, whatever their previous apathy.  The shutters of a"
"x36","map shop in the Strand were being taken down, my brother said, and a"
"x36","man in his Sunday raiment, lemon-yellow gloves even, was visible"
"x36","inside the window hastily fastening maps of Surrey to the glass."
"x36",""
"x36","Going on along the Strand to Trafalgar Square, the paper in his"
"x36","hand, my brother saw some of the fugitives from West Surrey.  There"
"x36","was a man with his wife and two boys and some articles of furniture in"
"x36","a cart such as greengrocers use.  He was driving from the direction of"
"x36","Westminster Bridge; and close behind him came a hay waggon with five"
"x36","or six respectable-looking people in it, and some boxes and bundles."
"x36","The faces of these people were haggard, and their entire appearance"
"x36","contrasted conspicuously with the Sabbath-best appearance of the"
"x36","people on the omnibuses.  People in fashionable clothing peeped at"
"x36","them out of cabs.  They stopped at the Square as if undecided which"
"x36","way to take, and finally turned eastward along the Strand.  Some way"
"x36","behind these came a man in workday clothes, riding one of those"
"x36","old-fashioned tricycles with a small front wheel.  He was dirty and"
"x36","white in the face."
"x36",""
"x36","My brother turned down towards Victoria, and met a number of such"
"x36","people.  He had a vague idea that he might see something of me.  He"
"x36","noticed an unusual number of police regulating the traffic.  Some of"
"x36","the refugees were exchanging news with the people on the omnibuses."
"x36","One was professing to have seen the Martians.  ""Boilers on stilts, I"
"x36","tell you, striding along like men.""  Most of them were excited and"
"x36","animated by their strange experience."
"x36",""
"x36","Beyond Victoria the public-houses were doing a lively trade with"
"x36","these arrivals.  At all the street corners groups of people were"
"x36","reading papers, talking excitedly, or staring at these unusual Sunday"
"x36","visitors.  They seemed to increase as night drew on, until at last the"
"x36","roads, my brother said, were like Epsom High Street on a Derby Day.  My"
"x36","brother addressed several of these fugitives and got unsatisfactory"
"x36","answers from most."
"x36",""
"x36","None of them could tell him any news of Woking except one man, who"
"x36","assured him that Woking had been entirely destroyed on the previous"
"x36","night."
"x36",""
"x36","""I come from Byfleet,"" he said; ""man on a bicycle came through the"
"x36","place in the early morning, and ran from door to door warning us to"
"x36","come away.  Then came soldiers.  We went out to look, and there were"
"x36","clouds of smoke to the south--nothing but smoke, and not a soul coming"
"x36","that way.  Then we heard the guns at Chertsey, and folks coming from"
"x36","Weybridge.  So I've locked up my house and come on."""
"x36",""
"x36","At the time there was a strong feeling in the streets that the"
"x36","authorities were to blame for their incapacity to dispose of the"
"x36","invaders without all this inconvenience."
"x36",""
"x36","About eight o'clock a noise of heavy firing was distinctly audible"
"x36","all over the south of London.  My brother could not hear it for the"
"x36","traffic in the main thoroughfares, but by striking through the quiet"
"x36","back streets to the river he was able to distinguish it quite plainly."
"x36",""
"x36","He walked from Westminster to his apartments near Regent's Park,"
"x36","about two.  He was now very anxious on my account, and disturbed at"
"x36","the evident magnitude of the trouble.  His mind was inclined to run,"
"x36","even as mine had run on Saturday, on military details.  He thought of"
"x36","all those silent, expectant guns, of the suddenly nomadic countryside;"
"x36","he tried to imagine ""boilers on stilts"" a hundred feet high."
"x36",""
"x36","There were one or two cartloads of refugees passing along Oxford"
"x36","Street, and several in the Marylebone Road, but so slowly was the news"
"x36","spreading that Regent Street and Portland Place were full of their"
"x36","usual Sunday-night promenaders, albeit they talked in groups, and"
"x36","along the edge of Regent's Park there were as many silent couples"
"x36","""walking out"" together under the scattered gas lamps as ever there had"
"x36","been.  The night was warm and still, and a little oppressive; the"
"x36","sound of guns continued intermittently, and after midnight there"
"x36","seemed to be sheet lightning in the south."
"x36",""
"x36","He read and re-read the paper, fearing the worst had happened to me."
"x36","He was restless, and after supper prowled out again aimlessly.  He"
"x36","returned and tried in vain to divert his attention to his examination"
"x36","notes.  He went to bed a little after midnight, and was awakened from"
"x36","lurid dreams in the small hours of Monday by the sound of door"
"x36","knockers, feet running in the street, distant drumming, and a clamour"
"x36","of bells.  Red reflections danced on the ceiling.  For a moment he lay"
"x36","astonished, wondering whether day had come or the world gone mad."
"x36","Then he jumped out of bed and ran to the window."
"x36",""
"x36","His room was an attic and as he thrust his head out, up and down"
"x36","the street there were a dozen echoes to the noise of his window sash,"
"x36","and heads in every kind of night disarray appeared.  Enquiries were"
"x36","being shouted.  ""They are coming!"" bawled a policeman, hammering at"
"x36","the door; ""the Martians are coming!"" and hurried to the next door."
"x36",""
"x36","The sound of drumming and trumpeting came from the Albany Street"
"x36","Barracks, and every church within earshot was hard at work killing"
"x36","sleep with a vehement disorderly tocsin.  There was a noise of doors"
"x36","opening, and window after window in the houses opposite flashed from"
"x36","darkness into yellow illumination."
"x36",""
"x36","Up the street came galloping a closed carriage, bursting abruptly"
"x36","into noise at the corner, rising to a clattering climax under the"
"x36","window, and dying away slowly in the distance.  Close on the rear of"
"x36","this came a couple of cabs, the forerunners of a long procession of"
"x36","flying vehicles, going for the most part to Chalk Farm station, where"
"x36","the North-Western special trains were loading up, instead of coming"
"x36","down the gradient into Euston."
"x36",""
"x36","For a long time my brother stared out of the window in blank"
"x36","astonishment, watching the policemen hammering at door after door, and"
"x36","delivering their incomprehensible message.  Then the door behind him"
"x36","opened, and the man who lodged across the landing came in, dressed"
"x36","only in shirt, trousers, and slippers, his braces loose about his"
"x36","waist, his hair disordered from his pillow."
"x36",""
"x36","""What the devil is it?"" he asked.  ""A fire?  What a devil of a"
"x36","row!"""
"x36",""
"x36","They both craned their heads out of the window, straining to hear"
"x36","what the policemen were shouting.  People were coming out of the side"
"x36","streets, and standing in groups at the corners talking."
"x36",""
"x36","""What the devil is it all about?"" said my brother's fellow lodger."
"x36",""
"x36","My brother answered him vaguely and began to dress, running with"
"x36","each garment to the window in order to miss nothing of the growing"
"x36","excitement.  And presently men selling unnaturally early newspapers"
"x36","came bawling into the street:"
"x36",""
"x36","""London in danger of suffocation!  The Kingston and Richmond"
"x36","defences forced!  Fearful massacres in the Thames Valley!"""
"x36",""
"x36","And all about him--in the rooms below, in the houses on each side"
"x36","and across the road, and behind in the Park Terraces and in the"
"x36","hundred other streets of that part of Marylebone, and the Westbourne"
"x36","Park district and St. Pancras, and westward and northward in Kilburn"
"x36","and St. John's Wood and Hampstead, and eastward in Shoreditch and"
"x36","Highbury and Haggerston and Hoxton, and, indeed, through all the"
"x36","vastness of London from Ealing to East Ham--people were rubbing their"
"x36","eyes, and opening windows to stare out and ask aimless questions,"
"x36","dressing hastily as the first breath of the coming storm of Fear blew"
"x36","through the streets.  It was the dawn of the great panic.  London,"
"x36","which had gone to bed on Sunday night oblivious and inert, was"
"x36","awakened, in the small hours of Monday morning, to a vivid sense of"
"x36","danger."
"x36",""
"x36","Unable from his window to learn what was happening, my brother went"
"x36","down and out into the street, just as the sky between the parapets of"
"x36","the houses grew pink with the early dawn.  The flying people on foot"
"x36","and in vehicles grew more numerous every moment.  ""Black Smoke!"" he"
"x36","heard people crying, and again ""Black Smoke!""  The contagion of such"
"x36","a unanimous fear was inevitable.  As my brother hesitated on the"
"x36","door-step, he saw another news vender approaching, and got a paper"
"x36","forthwith.  The man was running away with the rest, and selling his"
"x36","papers for a shilling each as he ran--a grotesque mingling of profit"
"x36","and panic."
"x36",""
"x36","And from this paper my brother read that catastrophic dispatch of"
"x36","the Commander-in-Chief:"
"x36",""
"x36","""The Martians are able to discharge enormous clouds of a black and"
"x36","poisonous vapour by means of rockets.  They have smothered our"
"x36","batteries, destroyed Richmond, Kingston, and Wimbledon, and are"
"x36","advancing slowly towards London, destroying everything on the way.  It"
"x36","is impossible to stop them.  There is no safety from the Black Smoke"
"x36","but in instant flight."""
"x36",""
"x36","That was all, but it was enough.  The whole population of the great"
"x36","six-million city was stirring, slipping, running; presently it would"
"x36","be pouring _en masse_ northward."
"x36",""
"x36","""Black Smoke!"" the voices cried.  ""Fire!"""
"x36",""
"x36","The bells of the neighbouring church made a jangling tumult, a cart"
"x36","carelessly driven smashed, amid shrieks and curses, against the water"
"x36","trough up the street.  Sickly yellow lights went to and fro in the"
"x36","houses, and some of the passing cabs flaunted unextinguished lamps."
"x36","And overhead the dawn was growing brighter, clear and steady and calm."
"x36",""
"x36","He heard footsteps running to and fro in the rooms, and up and down"
"x36","stairs behind him.  His landlady came to the door, loosely wrapped in"
"x36","dressing gown and shawl; her husband followed ejaculating."
"x36",""
"x36","As my brother began to realise the import of all these things, he"
"x36","turned hastily to his own room, put all his available money--some ten"
"x36","pounds altogether--into his pockets, and went out again into the"
"x36","streets."

"x36","CHAPTER FIFTEEN"
"x36",""
"x36","WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN SURREY"
"x36",""
"x36",""
"x36","It was while the curate had sat and talked so wildly to me under"
"x36","the hedge in the flat meadows near Halliford, and while my brother was"
"x36","watching the fugitives stream over Westminster Bridge, that the"
"x36","Martians had resumed the offensive.  So far as one can ascertain from"
"x36","the conflicting accounts that have been put forth, the majority of"
"x36","them remained busied with preparations in the Horsell pit until nine"
"x36","that night, hurrying on some operation that disengaged huge volumes of"
"x36","green smoke."
"x36",""
"x36","But three certainly came out about eight o'clock and, advancing"
"x36","slowly and cautiously, made their way through Byfleet and Pyrford"
"x36","towards Ripley and Weybridge, and so came in sight of the expectant"
"x36","batteries against the setting sun.  These Martians did not advance in"
"x36","a body, but in a line, each perhaps a mile and a half from his nearest"
"x36","fellow.  They communicated with one another by means of sirenlike"
"x36","howls, running up and down the scale from one note to another."
"x36",""
"x36","It was this howling and firing of the guns at Ripley and St."
"x36","George's Hill that we had heard at Upper Halliford.  The Ripley"
"x36","gunners, unseasoned artillery volunteers who ought never to have been"
"x36","placed in such a position, fired one wild, premature, ineffectual"
"x36","volley, and bolted on horse and foot through the deserted village,"
"x36","while the Martian, without using his Heat-Ray, walked serenely over"
"x36","their guns, stepped gingerly among them, passed in front of them, and"
"x36","so came unexpectedly upon the guns in Painshill Park, which he"
"x36","destroyed."
"x36",""
"x36","The St. George's Hill men, however, were better led or of a better"
"x36","mettle.  Hidden by a pine wood as they were, they seem to have been"
"x36","quite unsuspected by the Martian nearest to them.  They laid their"
"x36","guns as deliberately as if they had been on parade, and fired at about"
"x36","a thousand yards' range."
"x36",""
"x36","The shells flashed all round him, and he was seen to advance a few"
"x36","paces, stagger, and go down.  Everybody yelled together, and the guns"
"x36","were reloaded in frantic haste.  The overthrown Martian set up a"
"x36","prolonged ululation, and immediately a second glittering giant,"
"x36","answering him, appeared over the trees to the south.  It would seem"
"x36","that a leg of the tripod had been smashed by one of the shells.  The"
"x36","whole of the second volley flew wide of the Martian on the ground,"
"x36","and, simultaneously, both his companions brought their Heat-Rays to"
"x36","bear on the battery.  The ammunition blew up, the pine trees all about"
"x36","the guns flashed into fire, and only one or two of the men who were"
"x36","already running over the crest of the hill escaped."
"x36",""
"x36","After this it would seem that the three took counsel together and"
"x36","halted, and the scouts who were watching them report that they"
"x36","remained absolutely stationary for the next half hour.  The Martian"
"x36","who had been overthrown crawled tediously out of his hood, a small"
"x36","brown figure, oddly suggestive from that distance of a speck of"
"x36","blight, and apparently engaged in the repair of his support.  About"
"x36","nine he had finished, for his cowl was then seen above the trees"
"x36","again."
"x36",""
"x36","It was a few minutes past nine that night when these three"
"x36","sentinels were joined by four other Martians, each carrying a thick"
"x36","black tube.  A similar tube was handed to each of the three, and the"
"x36","seven proceeded to distribute themselves at equal distances along a"
"x36","curved line between St. George's Hill, Weybridge, and the village of"
"x36","Send, southwest of Ripley."
"x36",""
"x36","A dozen rockets sprang out of the hills before them so soon as they"
"x36","began to move, and warned the waiting batteries about Ditton and"
"x36","Esher.  At the same time four of their fighting machines, similarly"
"x36","armed with tubes, crossed the river, and two of them, black against"
"x36","the western sky, came into sight of myself and the curate as we"
"x36","hurried wearily and painfully along the road that runs northward out"
"x36","of Halliford.  They moved, as it seemed to us, upon a cloud, for a"
"x36","milky mist covered the fields and rose to a third of their height."
"x36",""
"x36","At this sight the curate cried faintly in his throat, and began"
"x36","running; but I knew it was no good running from a Martian, and I"
"x36","turned aside and crawled through dewy nettles and brambles into the"
"x36","broad ditch by the side of the road.  He looked back, saw what I was"
"x36","doing, and turned to join me."
"x36",""
"x36","The two halted, the nearer to us standing and facing Sunbury, the"
"x36","remoter being a grey indistinctness towards the evening star, away"
"x36","towards Staines."
"x36",""
"x36","The occasional howling of the Martians had ceased; they took up"
"x36","their positions in the huge crescent about their cylinders in absolute"
"x36","silence.  It was a crescent with twelve miles between its horns.  Never"
"x36","since the devising of gunpowder was the beginning of a battle so"
"x36","still.  To us and to an observer about Ripley it would have had"
"x36","precisely the same effect--the Martians seemed in solitary possession"
"x36","of the darkling night, lit only as it was by the slender moon, the"
"x36","stars, the afterglow of the daylight, and the ruddy glare from St."
"x36","George's Hill and the woods of Painshill."
"x36",""
"x36","But facing that crescent everywhere--at Staines, Hounslow, Ditton,"
"x36","Esher, Ockham, behind hills and woods south of the river, and across"
"x36","the flat grass meadows to the north of it, wherever a cluster of trees"
"x36","or village houses gave sufficient cover--the guns were waiting.  The"
"x36","signal rockets burst and rained their sparks through the night and"
"x36","vanished, and the spirit of all those watching batteries rose to a"
"x36","tense expectation.  The Martians had but to advance into the line of"
"x36","fire, and instantly those motionless black forms of men, those guns"
"x36","glittering so darkly in the early night, would explode into a"
"x36","thunderous fury of battle."
"x36",""
"x36","No doubt the thought that was uppermost in a thousand of those"
"x36","vigilant minds, even as it was uppermost in mine, was the riddle--how"
"x36","much they understood of us.  Did they grasp that we in our millions"
"x36","were organized, disciplined, working together?  Or did they interpret"
"x36","our spurts of fire, the sudden stinging of our shells, our steady"
"x36","investment of their encampment, as we should the furious unanimity of"
"x36","onslaught in a disturbed hive of bees?  Did they dream they might"
"x36","exterminate us?  (At that time no one knew what food they needed.)  A"
"x36","hundred such questions struggled together in my mind as I watched that"
"x36","vast sentinel shape.  And in the back of my mind was the sense of all"
"x36","the huge unknown and hidden forces Londonward.  Had they prepared"
"x36","pitfalls? Were the powder mills at Hounslow ready as a snare?  Would"
"x36","the Londoners have the heart and courage to make a greater Moscow of"
"x36","their mighty province of houses?"
"x36",""
"x36","Then, after an interminable time, as it seemed to us, crouching and"
"x36","peering through the hedge, came a sound like the distant concussion of"
"x36","a gun.  Another nearer, and then another.  And then the Martian beside"
"x36","us raised his tube on high and discharged it, gunwise, with a heavy"
"x36","report that made the ground heave.  The one towards Staines answered"
"x36","him.  There was no flash, no smoke, simply that loaded detonation."
"x36",""
"x36","I was so excited by these heavy minute-guns following one another"
"x36","that I so far forgot my personal safety and my scalded hands as to"
"x36","clamber up into the hedge and stare towards Sunbury.  As I did so a"
"x36","second report followed, and a big projectile hurtled overhead towards"
"x36","Hounslow.  I expected at least to see smoke or fire, or some such"
"x36","evidence of its work.  But all I saw was the deep blue sky above, with"
"x36","one solitary star, and the white mist spreading wide and low beneath."
"x36","And there had been no crash, no answering explosion.  The silence was"
"x36","restored; the minute lengthened to three."
"x36",""
"x36","""What has happened?"" said the curate, standing up beside me."
"x36",""
"x36","""Heaven knows!"" said I."
"x36",""
"x36","A bat flickered by and vanished.  A distant tumult of shouting"
"x36","began and ceased.  I looked again at the Martian, and saw he was now"
"x36","moving eastward along the riverbank, with a swift, rolling motion."
"x36",""
"x36","Every moment I expected the fire of some hidden battery to spring"
"x36","upon him; but the evening calm was unbroken.  The figure of the Martian"
"x36","grew smaller as he receded, and presently the mist and the gathering"
"x36","night had swallowed him up.  By a common impulse we clambered higher."
"x36","Towards Sunbury was a dark appearance, as though a conical hill had"
"x36","suddenly come into being there, hiding our view of the farther"
"x36","country; and then, remoter across the river, over Walton, we saw"
"x36","another such summit.  These hill-like forms grew lower and broader"
"x36","even as we stared."
"x36",""
"x36","Moved by a sudden thought, I looked northward, and there I"
"x36","perceived a third of these cloudy black kopjes had risen."
"x36",""
"x36","Everything had suddenly become very still.  Far away to the"
"x36","southeast, marking the quiet, we heard the Martians hooting to one"
"x36","another, and then the air quivered again with the distant thud of"
"x36","their guns.  But the earthly artillery made no reply."
"x36",""
"x36","Now at the time we could not understand these things, but later I"
"x36","was to learn the meaning of these ominous kopjes that gathered in the"
"x36","twilight.  Each of the Martians, standing in the great crescent I have"
"x36","described, had discharged, by means of the gunlike tube he carried, a"
"x36","huge canister over whatever hill, copse, cluster of houses, or other"
"x36","possible cover for guns, chanced to be in front of him.  Some fired"
"x36","only one of these, some two--as in the case of the one we had seen;"
"x36","the one at Ripley is said to have discharged no fewer than five at"
"x36","that time.  These canisters smashed on striking the ground--they did"
"x36","not explode--and incontinently disengaged an enormous volume of heavy,"
"x36","inky vapour, coiling and pouring upward in a huge and ebony cumulus"
"x36","cloud, a gaseous hill that sank and spread itself slowly over the"
"x36","surrounding country.  And the touch of that vapour, the inhaling of"
"x36","its pungent wisps, was death to all that breathes."
"x36",""
"x36","It was heavy, this vapour, heavier than the densest smoke, so that,"
"x36","after the first tumultuous uprush and outflow of its impact, it sank"
"x36","down through the air and poured over the ground in a manner rather"
"x36","liquid than gaseous, abandoning the hills, and streaming into the"
"x36","valleys and ditches and watercourses even as I have heard the"
"x36","carbonic-acid gas that pours from volcanic clefts is wont to do.  And"
"x36","where it came upon water some chemical action occurred, and the"
"x36","surface would be instantly covered with a powdery scum that sank"
"x36","slowly and made way for more.  The scum was absolutely insoluble, and"
"x36","it is a strange thing, seeing the instant effect of the gas, that one"
"x36","could drink without hurt the water from which it had been strained."
"x36","The vapour did not diffuse as a true gas would do.  It hung together"
"x36","in banks, flowing sluggishly down the slope of the land and driving"
"x36","reluctantly before the wind, and very slowly it combined with the mist"
"x36","and moisture of the air, and sank to the earth in the form of dust."
"x36","Save that an unknown element giving a group of four lines in the blue"
"x36","of the spectrum is concerned, we are still entirely ignorant of the"
"x36","nature of this substance."
"x36",""
"x36","Once the tumultuous upheaval of its dispersion was over, the black"
"x36","smoke clung so closely to the ground, even before its precipitation,"
"x36","that fifty feet up in the air, on the roofs and upper stories of high"
"x36","houses and on great trees, there was a chance of escaping its poison"
"x36","altogether, as was proved even that night at Street Cobham and Ditton."
"x36",""
"x36","The man who escaped at the former place tells a wonderful story of"
"x36","the strangeness of its coiling flow, and how he looked down from the"
"x36","church spire and saw the houses of the village rising like ghosts out"
"x36","of its inky nothingness.  For a day and a half he remained there,"
"x36","weary, starving and sun-scorched, the earth under the blue sky and"
"x36","against the prospect of the distant hills a velvet-black expanse, with"
"x36","red roofs, green trees, and, later, black-veiled shrubs and gates,"
"x36","barns, outhouses, and walls, rising here and there into the sunlight."
"x36",""
"x36","But that was at Street Cobham, where the black vapour was allowed"
"x36","to remain until it sank of its own accord into the ground.  As a rule"
"x36","the Martians, when it had served its purpose, cleared the air of it"
"x36","again by wading into it and directing a jet of steam upon it."
"x36",""
"x36","This they did with the vapour banks near us, as we saw in the"
"x36","starlight from the window of a deserted house at Upper Halliford,"
"x36","whither we had returned.  From there we could see the searchlights on"
"x36","Richmond Hill and Kingston Hill going to and fro, and about eleven the"
"x36","windows rattled, and we heard the sound of the huge siege guns that"
"x36","had been put in position there.  These continued intermittently for"
"x36","the space of a quarter of an hour, sending chance shots at the"
"x36","invisible Martians at Hampton and Ditton, and then the pale beams of"
"x36","the electric light vanished, and were replaced by a bright red glow."
"x36",""
"x36","Then the fourth cylinder fell--a brilliant green meteor--as I"
"x36","learned afterwards, in Bushey Park.  Before the guns on the Richmond"
"x36","and Kingston line of hills began, there was a fitful cannonade far"
"x36","away in the southwest, due, I believe, to guns being fired haphazard"
"x36","before the black vapour could overwhelm the gunners."
"x36",""
"x36","So, setting about it as methodically as men might smoke out a"
"x36","wasps' nest, the Martians spread this strange stifling vapour over the"
"x36","Londonward country.  The horns of the crescent slowly moved apart,"
"x36","until at last they formed a line from Hanwell to Coombe and Malden."
"x36","All night through their destructive tubes advanced.  Never once, after"
"x36","the Martian at St. George's Hill was brought down, did they give the"
"x36","artillery the ghost of a chance against them.  Wherever there was a"
"x36","possibility of guns being laid for them unseen, a fresh canister of"
"x36","the black vapour was discharged, and where the guns were openly"
"x36","displayed the Heat-Ray was brought to bear."
"x36",""
"x36","By midnight the blazing trees along the slopes of Richmond Park and"
"x36","the glare of Kingston Hill threw their light upon a network of black"
"x36","smoke, blotting out the whole valley of the Thames and extending as"
"x36","far as the eye could reach.  And through this two Martians slowly"
"x36","waded, and turned their hissing steam jets this way and that."
"x36",""
"x36","They were sparing of the Heat-Ray that night, either because they"
"x36","had but a limited supply of material for its production or because"
"x36","they did not wish to destroy the country but only to crush and overawe"
"x36","the opposition they had aroused.  In the latter aim they certainly"
"x36","succeeded.  Sunday night was the end of the organised opposition to"
"x36","their movements.  After that no body of men would stand against them,"
"x36","so hopeless was the enterprise.  Even the crews of the torpedo-boats"
"x36","and destroyers that had brought their quick-firers up the Thames"
"x36","refused to stop, mutinied, and went down again.  The only offensive"
"x36","operation men ventured upon after that night was the preparation of"
"x36","mines and pitfalls, and even in that their energies were frantic and"
"x36","spasmodic."
"x36",""
"x36","One has to imagine, as well as one may, the fate of those batteries"
"x36","towards Esher, waiting so tensely in the twilight.  Survivors there"
"x36","were none.  One may picture the orderly expectation, the officers"
"x36","alert and watchful, the gunners ready, the ammunition piled to hand,"
"x36","the limber gunners with their horses and waggons, the groups of"
"x36","civilian spectators standing as near as they were permitted, the"
"x36","evening stillness, the ambulances and hospital tents with the burned"
"x36","and wounded from Weybridge; then the dull resonance of the shots the"
"x36","Martians fired, and the clumsy projectile whirling over the trees and"
"x36","houses and smashing amid the neighbouring fields."
"x36",""
"x36","One may picture, too, the sudden shifting of the attention, the"
"x36","swiftly spreading coils and bellyings of that blackness advancing"
"x36","headlong, towering heavenward, turning the twilight to a palpable"
"x36","darkness, a strange and horrible antagonist of vapour striding upon"
"x36","its victims, men and horses near it seen dimly, running, shrieking,"
"x36","falling headlong, shouts of dismay, the guns suddenly abandoned, men"
"x36","choking and writhing on the ground, and the swift broadening-out of"
"x36","the opaque cone of smoke.  And then night and extinction--nothing but"
"x36","a silent mass of impenetrable vapour hiding its dead."
"x36",""
"x36","Before dawn the black vapour was pouring through the streets of"
"x36","Richmond, and the disintegrating organism of government was, with a"
"x36","last expiring effort, rousing the population of London to the"
"x36","necessity of flight."

"x36","CHAPTER SIXTEEN"
"x36",""
"x36","THE EXODUS FROM LONDON"
"x36",""
"x36",""
"x36","So you understand the roaring wave of fear that swept through the"
"x36","greatest city in the world just as Monday was dawning--the stream of"
"x36","flight rising swiftly to a torrent, lashing in a foaming tumult round"
"x36","the railway stations, banked up into a horrible struggle about the"
"x36","shipping in the Thames, and hurrying by every available channel"
"x36","northward and eastward.  By ten o'clock the police organisation, and"
"x36","by midday even the railway organisations, were losing coherency,"
"x36","losing shape and efficiency, guttering, softening, running at last in"
"x36","that swift liquefaction of the social body."
"x36",""
"x36","All the railway lines north of the Thames and the South-Eastern"
"x36","people at Cannon Street had been warned by midnight on Sunday, and"
"x36","trains were being filled.  People were fighting savagely for"
"x36","standing-room in the carriages even at two o'clock.  By three, people"
"x36","were being trampled and crushed even in Bishopsgate Street, a couple"
"x36","of hundred yards or more from Liverpool Street station; revolvers were"
"x36","fired, people stabbed, and the policemen who had been sent to direct"
"x36","the traffic, exhausted and infuriated, were breaking the heads of the"
"x36","people they were called out to protect."
"x36",""
"x36","And as the day advanced and the engine drivers and stokers refused"
"x36","to return to London, the pressure of the flight drove the people in an"
"x36","ever-thickening multitude away from the stations and along the"
"x36","northward-running roads.  By midday a Martian had been seen at Barnes,"
"x36","and a cloud of slowly sinking black vapour drove along the Thames and"
"x36","across the flats of Lambeth, cutting off all escape over the bridges"
"x36","in its sluggish advance.  Another bank drove over Ealing, and"
"x36","surrounded a little island of survivors on Castle Hill, alive, but"
"x36","unable to escape."
"x36",""
"x36","After a fruitless struggle to get aboard a North-Western train at"
"x36","Chalk Farm--the engines of the trains that had loaded in the goods"
"x36","yard there _ploughed_ through shrieking people, and a dozen stalwart men"
"x36","fought to keep the crowd from crushing the driver against his"
"x36","furnace--my brother emerged upon the Chalk Farm road, dodged across"
"x36","through a hurrying swarm of vehicles, and had the luck to be foremost"
"x36","in the sack of a cycle shop.  The front tire of the machine he got was"
"x36","punctured in dragging it through the window, but he got up and off,"
"x36","notwithstanding, with no further injury than a cut wrist.  The steep"
"x36","foot of Haverstock Hill was impassable owing to several overturned"
"x36","horses, and my brother struck into Belsize Road."
"x36",""
"x36","So he got out of the fury of the panic, and, skirting the Edgware"
"x36","Road, reached Edgware about seven, fasting and wearied, but well ahead"
"x36","of the crowd.  Along the road people were standing in the roadway,"
"x36","curious, wondering.  He was passed by a number of cyclists, some"
"x36","horsemen, and two motor cars.  A mile from Edgware the rim of the"
"x36","wheel broke, and the machine became unridable.  He left it by the"
"x36","roadside and trudged through the village.  There were shops half"
"x36","opened in the main street of the place, and people crowded on the"
"x36","pavement and in the doorways and windows, staring astonished at this"
"x36","extraordinary procession of fugitives that was beginning.  He"
"x36","succeeded in getting some food at an inn."
"x36",""
"x36","For a time he remained in Edgware not knowing what next to do.  The"
"x36","flying people increased in number.  Many of them, like my brother,"
"x36","seemed inclined to loiter in the place.  There was no fresh news of"
"x36","the invaders from Mars."
"x36",""
"x36","At that time the road was crowded, but as yet far from congested."
"x36","Most of the fugitives at that hour were mounted on cycles, but there"
"x36","were soon motor cars, hansom cabs, and carriages hurrying along, and"
"x36","the dust hung in heavy clouds along the road to St. Albans."
"x36",""
"x36","It was perhaps a vague idea of making his way to Chelmsford, where"
"x36","some friends of his lived, that at last induced my brother to strike"
"x36","into a quiet lane running eastward.  Presently he came upon a stile,"
"x36","and, crossing it, followed a footpath northeastward.  He passed near"
"x36","several farmhouses and some little places whose names he did not"
"x36","learn.  He saw few fugitives until, in a grass lane towards High"
"x36","Barnet, he happened upon two ladies who became his fellow travellers."
"x36","He came upon them just in time to save them."
"x36",""
"x36","He heard their screams, and, hurrying round the corner, saw a"
"x36","couple of men struggling to drag them out of the little pony-chaise in"
"x36","which they had been driving, while a third with difficulty held the"
"x36","frightened pony's head.  One of the ladies, a short woman dressed in"
"x36","white, was simply screaming; the other, a dark, slender figure,"
"x36","slashed at the man who gripped her arm with a whip she held in her"
"x36","disengaged hand."
"x36",""
"x36","My brother immediately grasped the situation, shouted, and hurried"
"x36","towards the struggle.  One of the men desisted and turned towards him,"
"x36","and my brother, realising from his antagonist's face that a fight was"
"x36","unavoidable, and being an expert boxer, went into him forthwith and"
"x36","sent him down against the wheel of the chaise."
"x36",""
"x36","It was no time for pugilistic chivalry and my brother laid him"
"x36","quiet with a kick, and gripped the collar of the man who pulled at the"
"x36","slender lady's arm.  He heard the clatter of hoofs, the whip stung"
"x36","across his face, a third antagonist struck him between the eyes, and"
"x36","the man he held wrenched himself free and made off down the lane in"
"x36","the direction from which he had come."
"x36",""
"x36","Partly stunned, he found himself facing the man who had held the"
"x36","horse's head, and became aware of the chaise receding from him down"
"x36","the lane, swaying from side to side, and with the women in it looking"
"x36","back.  The man before him, a burly rough, tried to close, and he"
"x36","stopped him with a blow in the face.  Then, realising that he was"
"x36","deserted, he dodged round and made off down the lane after the chaise,"
"x36","with the sturdy man close behind him, and the fugitive, who had turned"
"x36","now, following remotely."
"x36",""
"x36","Suddenly he stumbled and fell; his immediate pursuer went headlong,"
"x36","and he rose to his feet to find himself with a couple of antagonists"
"x36","again.  He would have had little chance against them had not the"
"x36","slender lady very pluckily pulled up and returned to his help.  It"
"x36","seems she had had a revolver all this time, but it had been under the"
"x36","seat when she and her companion were attacked.  She fired at six"
"x36","yards' distance, narrowly missing my brother.  The less courageous of"
"x36","the robbers made off, and his companion followed him, cursing his"
"x36","cowardice.  They both stopped in sight down the lane, where the third"
"x36","man lay insensible."
"x36",""
"x36","""Take this!"" said the slender lady, and she gave my brother her"
"x36","revolver."
"x36",""
"x36","""Go back to the chaise,"" said my brother, wiping the blood from his"
"x36","split lip."
"x36",""
"x36","She turned without a word--they were both panting--and they went"
"x36","back to where the lady in white struggled to hold back the frightened"
"x36","pony."
"x36",""
"x36","The robbers had evidently had enough of it.  When my brother looked"
"x36","again they were retreating."
"x36",""
"x36","""I'll sit here,"" said my brother, ""if I may""; and he got upon the"
"x36","empty front seat.  The lady looked over her shoulder."
"x36",""
"x36","""Give me the reins,"" she said, and laid the whip along the pony's"
"x36","side.  In another moment a bend in the road hid the three men from my"
"x36","brother's eyes."
"x36",""
"x36","So, quite unexpectedly, my brother found himself, panting, with a"
"x36","cut mouth, a bruised jaw, and bloodstained knuckles, driving along an"
"x36","unknown lane with these two women."
"x36",""
"x36","He learned they were the wife and the younger sister of a surgeon"
"x36","living at Stanmore, who had come in the small hours from a dangerous"
"x36","case at Pinner, and heard at some railway station on his way of the"
"x36","Martian advance.  He had hurried home, roused the women--their servant"
"x36","had left them two days before--packed some provisions, put his"
"x36","revolver under the seat--luckily for my brother--and told them to"
"x36","drive on to Edgware, with the idea of getting a train there.  He"
"x36","stopped behind to tell the neighbours.  He would overtake them, he"
"x36","said, at about half past four in the morning, and now it was nearly"
"x36","nine and they had seen nothing of him.  They could not stop in Edgware"
"x36","because of the growing traffic through the place, and so they had come"
"x36","into this side lane."
"x36",""
"x36","That was the story they told my brother in fragments when presently"
"x36","they stopped again, nearer to New Barnet.  He promised to stay with"
"x36","them, at least until they could determine what to do, or until the"
"x36","missing man arrived, and professed to be an expert shot with the"
"x36","revolver--a weapon strange to him--in order to give them confidence."
"x36",""
"x36","They made a sort of encampment by the wayside, and the pony became"
"x36","happy in the hedge.  He told them of his own escape out of London, and"
"x36","all that he knew of these Martians and their ways.  The sun crept"
"x36","higher in the sky, and after a time their talk died out and gave place"
"x36","to an uneasy state of anticipation.  Several wayfarers came along the"
"x36","lane, and of these my brother gathered such news as he could.  Every"
"x36","broken answer he had deepened his impression of the great disaster"
"x36","that had come on humanity, deepened his persuasion of the immediate"
"x36","necessity for prosecuting this flight.  He urged the matter upon them."
"x36",""
"x36","""We have money,"" said the slender woman, and hesitated."
"x36",""
"x36","Her eyes met my brother's, and her hesitation ended."
"x36",""
"x36","""So have I,"" said my brother."
"x36",""
"x36","She explained that they had as much as thirty pounds in gold,"
"x36","besides a five-pound note, and suggested that with that they might get"
"x36","upon a train at St. Albans or New Barnet.  My brother thought that was"
"x36","hopeless, seeing the fury of the Londoners to crowd upon the trains,"
"x36","and broached his own idea of striking across Essex towards Harwich and"
"x36","thence escaping from the country altogether."
"x36",""
"x36","Mrs. Elphinstone--that was the name of the woman in white--would"
"x36","listen to no reasoning, and kept calling upon ""George""; but her"
"x36","sister-in-law was astonishingly quiet and deliberate, and at last"
"x36","agreed to my brother's suggestion.  So, designing to cross the Great"
"x36","North Road, they went on towards Barnet, my brother leading the pony"
"x36","to save it as much as possible.  As the sun crept up the sky the day"
"x36","became excessively hot, and under foot a thick, whitish sand grew"
"x36","burning and blinding, so that they travelled only very slowly.  The"
"x36","hedges were grey with dust.  And as they advanced towards Barnet a"
"x36","tumultuous murmuring grew stronger."
"x36",""
"x36","They began to meet more people.  For the most part these were"
"x36","staring before them, murmuring indistinct questions, jaded, haggard,"
"x36","unclean.  One man in evening dress passed them on foot, his eyes on"
"x36","the ground.  They heard his voice, and, looking back at him, saw one"
"x36","hand clutched in his hair and the other beating invisible things.  His"
"x36","paroxysm of rage over, he went on his way without once looking back."
"x36",""
"x36","As my brother's party went on towards the crossroads to the south"
"x36","of Barnet they saw a woman approaching the road across some fields on"
"x36","their left, carrying a child and with two other children; and then"
"x36","passed a man in dirty black, with a thick stick in one hand and a"
"x36","small portmanteau in the other.  Then round the corner of the lane,"
"x36","from between the villas that guarded it at its confluence with the"
"x36","high road, came a little cart drawn by a sweating black pony and"
"x36","driven by a sallow youth in a bowler hat, grey with dust.  There were"
"x36","three girls, East End factory girls, and a couple of little children"
"x36","crowded in the cart."
"x36",""
"x36","""This'll tike us rahnd Edgware?"" asked the driver, wild-eyed,"
"x36","white-faced; and when my brother told him it would if he turned to the"
"x36","left, he whipped up at once without the formality of thanks."
"x36",""
"x36","My brother noticed a pale grey smoke or haze rising among the"
"x36","houses in front of them, and veiling the white facade of a terrace"
"x36","beyond the road that appeared between the backs of the villas.  Mrs."
"x36","Elphinstone suddenly cried out at a number of tongues of smoky red"
"x36","flame leaping up above the houses in front of them against the hot,"
"x36","blue sky.  The tumultuous noise resolved itself now into the"
"x36","disorderly mingling of many voices, the gride of many wheels, the"
"x36","creaking of waggons, and the staccato of hoofs.  The lane came round"
"x36","sharply not fifty yards from the crossroads."
"x36",""
"x36","""Good heavens!"" cried Mrs. Elphinstone.  ""What is this you are"
"x36","driving us into?"""
"x36",""
"x36","My brother stopped."
"x36",""
"x36","For the main road was a boiling stream of people, a torrent of"
"x36","human beings rushing northward, one pressing on another.  A great bank"
"x36","of dust, white and luminous in the blaze of the sun, made everything"
"x36","within twenty feet of the ground grey and indistinct and was"
"x36","perpetually renewed by the hurrying feet of a dense crowd of horses"
"x36","and of men and women on foot, and by the wheels of vehicles of every"
"x36","description."
"x36",""
"x36","""Way!"" my brother heard voices crying.  ""Make way!"""
"x36",""
"x36","It was like riding into the smoke of a fire to approach the meeting"
"x36","point of the lane and road; the crowd roared like a fire, and the dust"
"x36","was hot and pungent.  And, indeed, a little way up the road a villa"
"x36","was burning and sending rolling masses of black smoke across the road"
"x36","to add to the confusion."
"x36",""
"x36","Two men came past them.  Then a dirty woman, carrying a heavy"
"x36","bundle and weeping.  A lost retriever dog, with hanging tongue,"
"x36","circled dubiously round them, scared and wretched, and fled at my"
"x36","brother's threat."
"x36",""
"x36","So much as they could see of the road Londonward between the houses"
"x36","to the right was a tumultuous stream of dirty, hurrying people, pent"
"x36","in between the villas on either side; the black heads, the crowded"
"x36","forms, grew into distinctness as they rushed towards the corner,"
"x36","hurried past, and merged their individuality again in a receding"
"x36","multitude that was swallowed up at last in a cloud of dust."
"x36",""
"x36","""Go on!  Go on!"" cried the voices.  ""Way!  Way!"""
"x36",""
"x36","One man's hands pressed on the back of another.  My brother stood"
"x36","at the pony's head.  Irresistibly attracted, he advanced slowly, pace"
"x36","by pace, down the lane."
"x36",""
"x36","Edgware had been a scene of confusion, Chalk Farm a riotous tumult,"
"x36","but this was a whole population in movement.  It is hard to imagine"
"x36","that host.  It had no character of its own.  The figures poured out"
"x36","past the corner, and receded with their backs to the group in the"
"x36","lane.  Along the margin came those who were on foot threatened by the"
"x36","wheels, stumbling in the ditches, blundering into one another."
"x36",""
"x36","The carts and carriages crowded close upon one another, making"
"x36","little way for those swifter and more impatient vehicles that darted"
"x36","forward every now and then when an opportunity showed itself of doing"
"x36","so, sending the people scattering against the fences and gates of the"
"x36","villas."
"x36",""
"x36","""Push on!"" was the cry.  ""Push on!  They are coming!"""
"x36",""
"x36","In one cart stood a blind man in the uniform of the Salvation Army,"

"x36","could hear him long after he was lost to sight in the dust.  Some of"
"x36","the people who crowded in the carts whipped stupidly at their horses"
"x36","and quarrelled with other drivers; some sat motionless, staring at"
"x36","nothing with miserable eyes; some gnawed their hands with thirst, or"
"x36","lay prostrate in the bottoms of their conveyances.  The horses' bits"
"x36","were covered with foam, their eyes bloodshot."
"x36",""
"x36","There were cabs, carriages, shop cars, waggons, beyond counting; a"
"x36","mail cart, a road-cleaner's cart marked ""Vestry of St. Pancras,"" a"
"x36","huge timber waggon crowded with roughs.  A brewer's dray rumbled by"
"x36","with its two near wheels splashed with fresh blood."
"x36",""
"x36","""Clear the way!"" cried the voices.  ""Clear the way!"""
"x36",""
"x36","""Eter-nity!  Eter-nity!"" came echoing down the road."
"x36",""
"x36","There were sad, haggard women tramping by, well dressed, with"
"x36","children that cried and stumbled, their dainty clothes smothered in"
"x36","dust, their weary faces smeared with tears.  With many of these came"
"x36","men, sometimes helpful, sometimes lowering and savage.  Fighting side"
"x36","by side with them pushed some weary street outcast in faded black"
"x36","rags, wide-eyed, loud-voiced, and foul-mouthed.  There were sturdy"
"x36","workmen thrusting their way along, wretched, unkempt men, clothed like"
"x36","clerks or shopmen, struggling spasmodically; a wounded soldier my"
"x36","brother noticed, men dressed in the clothes of railway porters, one"
"x36","wretched creature in a nightshirt with a coat thrown over it."
"x36",""
"x36","But varied as its composition was, certain things all that host had"
"x36","in common.  There were fear and pain on their faces, and fear behind"
"x36","them.  A tumult up the road, a quarrel for a place in a waggon, sent"
"x36","the whole host of them quickening their pace; even a man so scared and"
"x36","broken that his knees bent under him was galvanised for a moment into"
"x36","renewed activity.  The heat and dust had already been at work upon"
"x36","this multitude.  Their skins were dry, their lips black and cracked."
"x36","They were all thirsty, weary, and footsore.  And amid the various"
"x36","cries one heard disputes, reproaches, groans of weariness and fatigue;"
"x36","the voices of most of them were hoarse and weak.  Through it all ran a"
"x36","refrain:"
"x36",""
"x36","""Way!  Way!  The Martians are coming!"""
"x36",""
"x36","Few stopped and came aside from that flood.  The lane opened"
"x36","slantingly into the main road with a narrow opening, and had a"
"x36","delusive appearance of coming from the direction of London.  Yet a"
"x36","kind of eddy of people drove into its mouth; weaklings elbowed out of"
"x36","the stream, who for the most part rested but a moment before plunging"
"x36","into it again.  A little way down the lane, with two friends bending"
"x36","over him, lay a man with a bare leg, wrapped about with bloody rags."
"x36","He was a lucky man to have friends."
"x36",""
"x36","A little old man, with a grey military moustache and a filthy black"
"x36","frock coat, limped out and sat down beside the trap, removed his"
"x36","boot--his sock was blood-stained--shook out a pebble, and hobbled on"
"x36","again; and then a little girl of eight or nine, all alone, threw"
"x36","herself under the hedge close by my brother, weeping."
"x36",""
"x36","""I can't go on!  I can't go on!"""
"x36",""
"x36","My brother woke from his torpor of astonishment and lifted her up,"
"x36","speaking gently to her, and carried her to Miss Elphinstone.  So soon"
"x36","as my brother touched her she became quite still, as if frightened."
"x36",""
"x36","""Ellen!"" shrieked a woman in the crowd, with tears in her"
"x36","voice--""Ellen!""  And the child suddenly darted away from my brother,"
"x36","crying ""Mother!"""
"x36",""
"x36","""They are coming,"" said a man on horseback, riding past along the"
"x36","lane."
"x36",""
"x36","""Out of the way, there!"" bawled a coachman, towering high; and my"
"x36","brother saw a closed carriage turning into the lane."
"x36",""
"x36","The people crushed back on one another to avoid the horse.  My"
"x36","brother pushed the pony and chaise back into the hedge, and the man"
"x36","drove by and stopped at the turn of the way.  It was a carriage, with"
"x36","a pole for a pair of horses, but only one was in the traces.  My"
"x36","brother saw dimly through the dust that two men lifted out something"
"x36","on a white stretcher and put it gently on the grass beneath the privet"
"x36","hedge."
"x36",""
"x36","One of the men came running to my brother."
"x36",""
"x36","""Where is there any water?"" he said.  ""He is dying fast, and very"
"x36","thirsty.  It is Lord Garrick."""
"x36",""
"x36","""Lord Garrick!"" said my brother; ""the Chief Justice?"""
"x36",""
"x36","""The water?"" he said."
"x36",""
"x36","""There may be a tap,"" said my brother, ""in some of the houses.  We"
"x36","have no water.  I dare not leave my people."""
"x36",""
"x36","The man pushed against the crowd towards the gate of the corner"
"x36","house."
"x36",""
"x36","""Go on!"" said the people, thrusting at him.  ""They are coming!  Go"
"x36","on!"""
"x36",""
"x36","Then my brother's attention was distracted by a bearded, eagle-faced"
"x36","man lugging a small handbag, which split even as my brother's"
"x36","eyes rested on it and disgorged a mass of sovereigns that seemed to"
"x36","break up into separate coins as it struck the ground.  They rolled"
"x36","hither and thither among the struggling feet of men and horses.  The"
"x36","man stopped and looked stupidly at the heap, and the shaft of a cab"
"x36","struck his shoulder and sent him reeling.  He gave a shriek and dodged"
"x36","back, and a cartwheel shaved him narrowly."
"x36",""
"x36","""Way!"" cried the men all about him.  ""Make way!"""
"x36",""
"x36","So soon as the cab had passed, he flung himself, with both hands"
"x36","open, upon the heap of coins, and began thrusting handfuls in his"
"x36","pocket.  A horse rose close upon him, and in another moment, half"
"x36","rising, he had been borne down under the horse's hoofs."
"x36",""
"x36","""Stop!"" screamed my brother, and pushing a woman out of his way,"
"x36","tried to clutch the bit of the horse."
"x36",""
"x36","Before he could get to it, he heard a scream under the wheels, and"
"x36","saw through the dust the rim passing over the poor wretch's back.  The"
"x36","driver of the cart slashed his whip at my brother, who ran round"
"x36","behind the cart.  The multitudinous shouting confused his ears.  The"
"x36","man was writhing in the dust among his scattered money, unable to"
"x36","rise, for the wheel had broken his back, and his lower limbs lay limp"
"x36","and dead.  My brother stood up and yelled at the next driver, and a"
"x36","man on a black horse came to his assistance."
"x36",""
"x36","""Get him out of the road,"" said he; and, clutching the man's collar"
"x36","with his free hand, my brother lugged him sideways.  But he still"
"x36","clutched after his money, and regarded my brother fiercely, hammering"
"x36","at his arm with a handful of gold.  ""Go on!  Go on!"" shouted angry"
"x36","voices behind."
"x36",""
"x36","""Way!  Way!"""
"x36",""
"x36","There was a smash as the pole of a carriage crashed into the cart"
"x36","that the man on horseback stopped.  My brother looked up, and the man"
"x36","with the gold twisted his head round and bit the wrist that held his"
"x36","collar.  There was a concussion, and the black horse came staggering"
"x36","sideways, and the carthorse pushed beside it.  A hoof missed my"
"x36","brother's foot by a hair's breadth.  He released his grip on the"
"x36","fallen man and jumped back.  He saw anger change to terror on the face"
"x36","of the poor wretch on the ground, and in a moment he was hidden and my"
"x36","brother was borne backward and carried past the entrance of the lane,"
"x36","and had to fight hard in the torrent to recover it."
"x36",""
"x36","He saw Miss Elphinstone covering her eyes, and a little child, with"
"x36","all a child's want of sympathetic imagination, staring with dilated"
"x36","eyes at a dusty something that lay black and still, ground and crushed"
"x36","under the rolling wheels.  ""Let us go back!"" he shouted, and began"
"x36","turning the pony round. ""We cannot cross this--hell,"" he said and they"
"x36","went back a hundred yards the way they had come, until the fighting"
"x36","crowd was hidden.  As they passed the bend in the lane my brother saw"
"x36","the face of the dying man in the ditch under the privet, deadly white"
"x36","and drawn, and shining with perspiration.  The two women sat silent,"
"x36","crouching in their seat and shivering."
"x36",""
"x36","Then beyond the bend my brother stopped again.  Miss Elphinstone"
"x36","was white and pale, and her sister-in-law sat weeping, too wretched"
"x36","even to call upon ""George.""  My brother was horrified and perplexed."
"x36","So soon as they had retreated he realised how urgent and unavoidable"
"x36","it was to attempt this crossing.  He turned to Miss Elphinstone,"
"x36","suddenly resolute."
"x36",""
"x36","""We must go that way,"" he said, and led the pony round again."
"x36",""
"x36","For the second time that day this girl proved her quality.  To force"
"x36","their way into the torrent of people, my brother plunged into the"
"x36","traffic and held back a cab horse, while she drove the pony across its"
"x36","head.  A waggon locked wheels for a moment and ripped a long splinter"
"x36","from the chaise.  In another moment they were caught and swept forward"
"x36","by the stream.  My brother, with the cabman's whip marks red across"
"x36","his face and hands, scrambled into the chaise and took the reins from"
"x36","her."
"x36",""
"x36","""Point the revolver at the man behind,"" he said, giving it to her,"
"x36","""if he presses us too hard.  No!--point it at his horse."""
"x36",""
"x36","Then he began to look out for a chance of edging to the right"
"x36","across the road.  But once in the stream he seemed to lose volition,"
"x36","to become a part of that dusty rout.  They swept through Chipping"
"x36","Barnet with the torrent; they were nearly a mile beyond the centre of"
"x36","the town before they had fought across to the opposite side of the"
"x36","way.  It was din and confusion indescribable; but in and beyond the"
"x36","town the road forks repeatedly, and this to some extent relieved the"
"x36","stress."
"x36",""
"x36","They struck eastward through Hadley, and there on either side of"
"x36","the road, and at another place farther on they came upon a great"
"x36","multitude of people drinking at the stream, some fighting to come at"
"x36","the water.  And farther on, from a lull near East Barnet, they saw"
"x36","two trains running slowly one after the other without signal or"
"x36","order--trains swarming with people, with men even among the coals"
"x36","behind the engines--going northward along the Great Northern Railway."
"x36","My brother supposes they must have filled outside London, for at that"
"x36","time the furious terror of the people had rendered the central"
"x36","termini impossible."
"x36",""
"x36","Near this place they halted for the rest of the afternoon, for the"
"x36","violence of the day had already utterly exhausted all three of them."
"x36","They began to suffer the beginnings of hunger; the night was cold, and"
"x36","none of them dared to sleep.  And in the evening many people came"
"x36","hurrying along the road nearby their stopping place, fleeing from"
"x36","unknown dangers before them, and going in the direction from which my"
"x36","brother had come."

"x36","CHAPTER SEVENTEEN"
"x36",""
"x36","THE ""THUNDER CHILD"""
"x36",""
"x36",""
"x36","Had the Martians aimed only at destruction, they might on Monday"
"x36","have annihilated the entire population of London, as it spread itself"
"x36","slowly through the home counties.  Not only along the road through"
"x36","Barnet, but also through Edgware and Waltham Abbey, and along the"
"x36","roads eastward to Southend and Shoeburyness, and south of the Thames"
"x36","to Deal and Broadstairs, poured the same frantic rout.  If one could"
"x36","have hung that June morning in a balloon in the blazing blue above"
"x36","London every northward and eastward road running out of the tangled"
"x36","maze of streets would have seemed stippled black with the streaming"
"x36","fugitives, each dot a human agony of terror and physical distress.  I"
"x36","have set forth at length in the last chapter my brother's account of"
"x36","the road through Chipping Barnet, in order that my readers may realise"
"x36","how that swarming of black dots appeared to one of those concerned."
"x36","Never before in the history of the world had such a mass of human"
"x36","beings moved and suffered together.  The legendary hosts of Goths and"
"x36","Huns, the hugest armies Asia has ever seen, would have been but a drop"
"x36","in that current.  And this was no disciplined march; it was a"
"x36","stampede--a stampede gigantic and terrible--without order and without"
"x36","a goal, six million people unarmed and unprovisioned, driving"
"x36","headlong.  It was the beginning of the rout of civilisation, of the"
"x36","massacre of mankind."
"x36",""
"x36","Directly below him the balloonist would have seen the network of"
"x36","streets far and wide, houses, churches, squares, crescents,"
"x36","gardens--already derelict--spread out like a huge map, and in the"
"x36","southward _blotted_.  Over Ealing, Richmond, Wimbledon, it would"
"x36","have seemed as if some monstrous pen had flung ink upon the chart."
"x36","Steadily, incessantly, each black splash grew and spread, shooting out"
"x36","ramifications this way and that, now banking itself against rising"
"x36","ground, now pouring swiftly over a crest into a new-found valley,"
"x36","exactly as a gout of ink would spread itself upon blotting paper."
"x36",""
"x36","And beyond, over the blue hills that rise southward of the river,"
"x36","the glittering Martians went to and fro, calmly and methodically"
"x36","spreading their poison cloud over this patch of country and then over"
"x36","that, laying it again with their steam jets when it had served its"
"x36","purpose, and taking possession of the conquered country.  They do not"
"x36","seem to have aimed at extermination so much as at complete"
"x36","demoralisation and the destruction of any opposition.  They exploded"
"x36","any stores of powder they came upon, cut every telegraph, and wrecked"
"x36","the railways here and there.  They were hamstringing mankind.  They"
"x36","seemed in no hurry to extend the field of their operations, and did"
"x36","not come beyond the central part of London all that day.  It is"
"x36","possible that a very considerable number of people in London stuck to"
"x36","their houses through Monday morning.  Certain it is that many died at"
"x36","home suffocated by the Black Smoke."
"x36",""
"x36","Until about midday the Pool of London was an astonishing scene."
"x36","Steamboats and shipping of all sorts lay there, tempted by the"
"x36","enormous sums of money offered by fugitives, and it is said that many"
"x36","who swam out to these vessels were thrust off with boathooks and"
"x36","drowned.  About one o'clock in the afternoon the thinning remnant of a"
"x36","cloud of the black vapour appeared between the arches of Blackfriars"
"x36","Bridge.  At that the Pool became a scene of mad confusion, fighting,"
"x36","and collision, and for some time a multitude of boats and barges"
"x36","jammed in the northern arch of the Tower Bridge, and the sailors and"
"x36","lightermen had to fight savagely against the people who swarmed upon"
"x36","them from the riverfront.  People were actually clambering down the"
"x36","piers of the bridge from above."
"x36",""
"x36","When, an hour later, a Martian appeared beyond the Clock Tower and"
"x36","waded down the river, nothing but wreckage floated above Limehouse."
"x36",""
"x36","Of the falling of the fifth cylinder I have presently to tell.  The"
"x36","sixth star fell at Wimbledon.  My brother, keeping watch beside the"
"x36","women in the chaise in a meadow, saw the green flash of it far beyond"
"x36","the hills.  On Tuesday the little party, still set upon getting across"
"x36","the sea, made its way through the swarming country towards Colchester."
"x36","The news that the Martians were now in possession of the whole of"
"x36","London was confirmed.  They had been seen at Highgate, and even, it"
"x36","was said, at Neasden.  But they did not come into my brother's view"
"x36","until the morrow."
"x36",""
"x36","That day the scattered multitudes began to realise the urgent need"
"x36","of provisions.  As they grew hungry the rights of property ceased to"
"x36","be regarded.  Farmers were out to defend their cattle-sheds,"
"x36","granaries, and ripening root crops with arms in their hands.  A number"
"x36","of people now, like my brother, had their faces eastward, and there"
"x36","were some desperate souls even going back towards London to get food."
"x36","These were chiefly people from the northern suburbs, whose knowledge"
"x36","of the Black Smoke came by hearsay.  He heard that about half the"
"x36","members of the government had gathered at Birmingham, and that"
"x36","enormous quantities of high explosives were being prepared to be used"
"x36","in automatic mines across the Midland counties."
"x36",""
"x36","He was also told that the Midland Railway Company had replaced the"
"x36","desertions of the first day's panic, had resumed traffic, and was"
"x36","running northward trains from St. Albans to relieve the congestion of"
"x36","the home counties.  There was also a placard in Chipping Ongar"
"x36","announcing that large stores of flour were available in the northern"
"x36","towns and that within twenty-four hours bread would be distributed"
"x36","among the starving people in the neighbourhood.  But this intelligence"
"x36","did not deter him from the plan of escape he had formed, and the three"
"x36","pressed eastward all day, and heard no more of the bread distribution"
"x36","than this promise.  Nor, as a matter of fact, did anyone else hear"
"x36","more of it.  That night fell the seventh star, falling upon Primrose"
"x36","Hill.  It fell while Miss Elphinstone was watching, for she took that"
"x36","duty alternately with my brother.  She saw it."
"x36",""
"x36","On Wednesday the three fugitives--they had passed the night in a"
"x36","field of unripe wheat--reached Chelmsford, and there a body of the"
"x36","inhabitants, calling itself the Committee of Public Supply, seized the"
"x36","pony as provisions, and would give nothing in exchange for it but the"
"x36","promise of a share in it the next day.  Here there were rumours of"
"x36","Martians at Epping, and news of the destruction of Waltham Abbey"
"x36","Powder Mills in a vain attempt to blow up one of the invaders."
"x36",""
"x36","People were watching for Martians here from the church towers.  My"
"x36","brother, very luckily for him as it chanced, preferred to push on at"
"x36","once to the coast rather than wait for food, although all three of"
"x36","them were very hungry.  By midday they passed through Tillingham,"
"x36","which, strangely enough, seemed to be quite silent and deserted, save"
"x36","for a few furtive plunderers hunting for food.  Near Tillingham they"
"x36","suddenly came in sight of the sea, and the most amazing crowd of"
"x36","shipping of all sorts that it is possible to imagine."
"x36",""
"x36","For after the sailors could no longer come up the Thames, they came"
"x36","on to the Essex coast, to Harwich and Walton and Clacton, and"
"x36","afterwards to Foulness and Shoebury, to bring off the people.  They"
"x36","lay in a huge sickle-shaped curve that vanished into mist at last"
"x36","towards the Naze.  Close inshore was a multitude of fishing"
"x36","smacks--English, Scotch, French, Dutch, and Swedish; steam launches"
"x36","from the Thames, yachts, electric boats; and beyond were ships of large"
"x36","burden, a multitude of filthy colliers, trim merchantmen, cattle ships,"
"x36","passenger boats, petroleum tanks, ocean tramps, an old white transport"
"x36","even, neat white and grey liners from Southampton and Hamburg; and"
"x36","along the blue coast across the Blackwater my brother could make out"
"x36","dimly a dense swarm of boats chaffering with the people on the beach,"
"x36","a swarm which also extended up the Blackwater almost to Maldon."
"x36",""
"x36","About a couple of miles out lay an ironclad, very low in the water,"
"x36","almost, to my brother's perception, like a water-logged ship.  This"
"x36","was the ram _Thunder Child_.  It was the only warship in sight, but far"
"x36","away to the right over the smooth surface of the sea--for that day"
"x36","there was a dead calm--lay a serpent of black smoke to mark the next"
"x36","ironclads of the Channel Fleet, which hovered in an extended line,"
"x36","steam up and ready for action, across the Thames estuary during the"
"x36","course of the Martian conquest, vigilant and yet powerless to prevent"
"x36","it."
"x36",""
"x36","At the sight of the sea, Mrs. Elphinstone, in spite of the"
"x36","assurances of her sister-in-law, gave way to panic.  She had never"
"x36","been out of England before, she would rather die than trust herself"
"x36","friendless in a foreign country, and so forth.  She seemed, poor woman,"
"x36","to imagine that the French and the Martians might prove very similar."
"x36","She had been growing increasingly hysterical, fearful, and depressed"
"x36","during the two days' journeyings.  Her great idea was to return to"
"x36","Stanmore.  Things had been always well and safe at Stanmore.  They"
"x36","would find George at Stanmore."
"x36",""
"x36","It was with the greatest difficulty they could get her down to the"
"x36","beach, where presently my brother succeeded in attracting the"
"x36","attention of some men on a paddle steamer from the Thames.  They sent"
"x36","a boat and drove a bargain for thirty-six pounds for the three.  The"
"x36","steamer was going, these men said, to Ostend."
"x36",""
"x36","It was about two o'clock when my brother, having paid their fares"
"x36","at the gangway, found himself safely aboard the steamboat with his"
"x36","charges.  There was food aboard, albeit at exorbitant prices, and the"
"x36","three of them contrived to eat a meal on one of the seats forward."
"x36",""
"x36","There were already a couple of score of passengers aboard, some of"
"x36","whom had expended their last money in securing a passage, but the"
"x36","captain lay off the Blackwater until five in the afternoon, picking up"
"x36","passengers until the seated decks were even dangerously crowded.  He"
"x36","would probably have remained longer had it not been for the sound of"
"x36","guns that began about that hour in the south.  As if in answer, the"
"x36","ironclad seaward fired a small gun and hoisted a string of flags.  A"
"x36","jet of smoke sprang out of her funnels."
"x36",""
"x36","Some of the passengers were of opinion that this firing came from"
"x36","Shoeburyness, until it was noticed that it was growing louder.  At the"
"x36","same time, far away in the southeast the masts and upperworks of three"
"x36","ironclads rose one after the other out of the sea, beneath clouds of"
"x36","black smoke.  But my brother's attention speedily reverted to the"
"x36","distant firing in the south.  He fancied he saw a column of smoke"
"x36","rising out of the distant grey haze."
"x36",""
"x36","The little steamer was already flapping her way eastward of the big"
"x36","crescent of shipping, and the low Essex coast was growing blue and"
"x36","hazy, when a Martian appeared, small and faint in the remote distance,"
"x36","advancing along the muddy coast from the direction of Foulness.  At"
"x36","that the captain on the bridge swore at the top of his voice with fear"
"x36","and anger at his own delay, and the paddles seemed infected with his"
"x36","terror.  Every soul aboard stood at the bulwarks or on the seats of"
"x36","the steamer and stared at that distant shape, higher than the trees or"
"x36","church towers inland, and advancing with a leisurely parody of a human"
"x36","stride."
"x36",""
"x36","It was the first Martian my brother had seen, and he stood, more"
"x36","amazed than terrified, watching this Titan advancing deliberately"
"x36","towards the shipping, wading farther and farther into the water as the"
"x36","coast fell away.  Then, far away beyond the Crouch, came another,"
"x36","striding over some stunted trees, and then yet another, still farther"
"x36","off, wading deeply through a shiny mudflat that seemed to hang halfway"
"x36","up between sea and sky.  They were all stalking seaward, as if to"
"x36","intercept the escape of the multitudinous vessels that were crowded"
"x36","between Foulness and the Naze.  In spite of the throbbing exertions of"
"x36","the engines of the little paddle-boat, and the pouring foam that her"
"x36","wheels flung behind her, she receded with terrifying slowness from"
"x36","this ominous advance."
"x36",""
"x36","Glancing northwestward, my brother saw the large crescent of"
"x36","shipping already writhing with the approaching terror; one ship"
"x36","passing behind another, another coming round from broadside to end on,"
"x36","steamships whistling and giving off volumes of steam, sails being let"
"x36","out, launches rushing hither and thither.  He was so fascinated by"
"x36","this and by the creeping danger away to the left that he had no eyes"
"x36","for anything seaward.  And then a swift movement of the steamboat (she"
"x36","had suddenly come round to avoid being run down) flung him headlong"
"x36","from the seat upon which he was standing.  There was a shouting all"
"x36","about him, a trampling of feet, and a cheer that seemed to be answered"
"x36","faintly.  The steamboat lurched and rolled him over upon his hands."
"x36",""
"x36","He sprang to his feet and saw to starboard, and not a hundred yards"
"x36","from their heeling, pitching boat, a vast iron bulk like the blade of"
"x36","a plough tearing through the water, tossing it on either side in huge"
"x36","waves of foam that leaped towards the steamer, flinging her paddles"
"x36","helplessly in the air, and then sucking her deck down almost to the"
"x36","waterline."
"x36",""
"x36","A douche of spray blinded my brother for a moment.  When his eyes"
"x36","were clear again he saw the monster had passed and was rushing"
"x36","landward.  Big iron upperworks rose out of this headlong structure,"
"x36","and from that twin funnels projected and spat a smoking blast shot"
"x36","with fire.  It was the torpedo ram, _Thunder Child_, steaming headlong,"
"x36","coming to the rescue of the threatened shipping."
"x36",""
"x36","Keeping his footing on the heaving deck by clutching the bulwarks,"
"x36","my brother looked past this charging leviathan at the Martians again,"
"x36","and he saw the three of them now close together, and standing so far"
"x36","out to sea that their tripod supports were almost entirely submerged."
"x36","Thus sunken, and seen in remote perspective, they appeared far less"
"x36","formidable than the huge iron bulk in whose wake the steamer was"
"x36","pitching so helplessly.  It would seem they were regarding this new"
"x36","antagonist with astonishment.  To their intelligence, it may be, the"
"x36","giant was even such another as themselves.  The _Thunder Child_ fired no"
"x36","gun, but simply drove full speed towards them.  It was probably her"
"x36","not firing that enabled her to get so near the enemy as she did.  They"
"x36","did not know what to make of her.  One shell, and they would have sent"
"x36","her to the bottom forthwith with the Heat-Ray."
"x36",""
"x36","She was steaming at such a pace that in a minute she seemed halfway"
"x36","between the steamboat and the Martians--a diminishing black bulk"
"x36","against the receding horizontal expanse of the Essex coast."
"x36",""
"x36","Suddenly the foremost Martian lowered his tube and discharged a"
"x36","canister of the black gas at the ironclad.  It hit her larboard side"
"x36","and glanced off in an inky jet that rolled away to seaward, an"
"x36","unfolding torrent of Black Smoke, from which the ironclad drove clear."
"x36","To the watchers from the steamer, low in the water and with the sun in"
"x36","their eyes, it seemed as though she were already among the Martians."
"x36",""
"x36","They saw the gaunt figures separating and rising out of the water"
"x36","as they retreated shoreward, and one of them raised the camera-like"
"x36","generator of the Heat-Ray.  He held it pointing obliquely downward,"
"x36","and a bank of steam sprang from the water at its touch.  It must have"
"x36","driven through the iron of the ship's side like a white-hot iron rod"
"x36","through paper."
"x36",""
"x36","A flicker of flame went up through the rising steam, and then the"
"x36","Martian reeled and staggered.  In another moment he was cut down, and"
"x36","a great body of water and steam shot high in the air.  The guns of the"
"x36","_Thunder Child_ sounded through the reek, going off one after the other,"
"x36","and one shot splashed the water high close by the steamer, ricocheted"
"x36","towards the other flying ships to the north, and smashed a smack to"
"x36","matchwood."
"x36",""
"x36","But no one heeded that very much.  At the sight of the Martian's"
"x36","collapse the captain on the bridge yelled inarticulately, and all the"
"x36","crowding passengers on the steamer's stern shouted together.  And then"
"x36","they yelled again.  For, surging out beyond the white tumult, drove"
"x36","something long and black, the flames streaming from its middle parts,"
"x36","its ventilators and funnels spouting fire."
"x36",""
"x36","She was alive still; the steering gear, it seems, was intact and"
"x36","her engines working.  She headed straight for a second Martian, and"
"x36","was within a hundred yards of him when the Heat-Ray came to bear.  Then"
"x36","with a violent thud, a blinding flash, her decks, her funnels, leaped"
"x36","upward.  The Martian staggered with the violence of her explosion, and"
"x36","in another moment the flaming wreckage, still driving forward with the"
"x36","impetus of its pace, had struck him and crumpled him up like a thing"
"x36","of cardboard.  My brother shouted involuntarily.  A boiling tumult of"
"x36","steam hid everything again."
"x36",""
"x36","""Two!"" yelled the captain."
"x36",""
"x36","Everyone was shouting.  The whole steamer from end to end rang with"
"x36","frantic cheering that was taken up first by one and then by all in the"
"x36","crowding multitude of ships and boats that was driving out to sea."
"x36",""
"x36","The steam hung upon the water for many minutes, hiding the third"
"x36","Martian and the coast altogether.  And all this time the boat was"
"x36","paddling steadily out to sea and away from the fight; and when at last"
"x36","the confusion cleared, the drifting bank of black vapour intervened,"
"x36","and nothing of the _Thunder Child_ could be made out, nor could the"
"x36","third Martian be seen.  But the ironclads to seaward were now quite"
"x36","close and standing in towards shore past the steamboat."
"x36",""
"x36","The little vessel continued to beat its way seaward, and the"
"x36","ironclads receded slowly towards the coast, which was hidden still by"
"x36","a marbled bank of vapour, part steam, part black gas, eddying and"
"x36","combining in the strangest way.  The fleet of refugees was scattering"
"x36","to the northeast; several smacks were sailing between the ironclads"
"x36","and the steamboat.  After a time, and before they reached the sinking"
"x36","cloud bank, the warships turned northward, and then abruptly went"
"x36","about and passed into the thickening haze of evening southward.  The"
"x36","coast grew faint, and at last indistinguishable amid the low banks of"
"x36","clouds that were gathering about the sinking sun."
"x36",""
"x36","Then suddenly out of the golden haze of the sunset came the"
"x36","vibration of guns, and a form of black shadows moving.  Everyone"
"x36","struggled to the rail of the steamer and peered into the blinding"
"x36","furnace of the west, but nothing was to be distinguished clearly.  A"
"x36","mass of smoke rose slanting and barred the face of the sun.  The"
"x36","steamboat throbbed on its way through an interminable suspense."
"x36",""
"x36","The sun sank into grey clouds, the sky flushed and darkened, the"
"x36","evening star trembled into sight.  It was deep twilight when the"
"x36","captain cried out and pointed.  My brother strained his eyes."
"x36","Something rushed up into the sky out of the greyness--rushed"
"x36","slantingly upward and very swiftly into the luminous clearness above"
"x36","the clouds in the western sky; something flat and broad, and very"
"x36","large, that swept round in a vast curve, grew smaller, sank slowly,"
"x36","and vanished again into the grey mystery of the night.  And as it flew"
"x36","it rained down darkness upon the land."

"x36","CHAPTER ONE"
"x36",""
"x36","UNDER FOOT"
"x36",""
"x36",""
"x36","In the first book I have wandered so much from my own adventures to"
"x36","tell of the experiences of my brother that all through the last two"
"x36","chapters I and the curate have been lurking in the empty house at"
"x36","Halliford whither we fled to escape the Black Smoke.  There I will"
"x36","resume.  We stopped there all Sunday night and all the next day--the"
"x36","day of the panic--in a little island of daylight, cut off by the Black"
"x36","Smoke from the rest of the world.  We could do nothing but wait in"
"x36","aching inactivity during those two weary days."
"x36",""
"x36","My mind was occupied by anxiety for my wife.  I figured her at"
"x36","Leatherhead, terrified, in danger, mourning me already as a dead man."
"x36","I paced the rooms and cried aloud when I thought of how I was cut off"
"x36","from her, of all that might happen to her in my absence.  My cousin I"
"x36","knew was brave enough for any emergency, but he was not the sort of"
"x36","man to realise danger quickly, to rise promptly.  What was needed now"
"x36","was not bravery, but circumspection.  My only consolation was to"
"x36","believe that the Martians were moving London-ward and away from her."
"x36","Such vague anxieties keep the mind sensitive and painful.  I grew very"
"x36","weary and irritable with the curate's perpetual ejaculations; I tired"
"x36","of the sight of his selfish despair.  After some ineffectual"
"x36","remonstrance I kept away from him, staying in a room--evidently a"
"x36","children's schoolroom--containing globes, forms, and copybooks.  When"
"x36","he followed me thither, I went to a box room at the top of the house"
"x36","and, in order to be alone with my aching miseries, locked myself in."
"x36",""
"x36","We were hopelessly hemmed in by the Black Smoke all that day and"
"x36","the morning of the next.  There were signs of people in the next house"
"x36","on Sunday evening--a face at a window and moving lights, and later the"
"x36","slamming of a door.  But I do not know who these people were, nor what"
"x36","became of them.  We saw nothing of them next day.  The Black Smoke"
"x36","drifted slowly riverward all through Monday morning, creeping nearer"
"x36","and nearer to us, driving at last along the roadway outside the house"
"x36","that hid us."
"x36",""
"x36","A Martian came across the fields about midday, laying the stuff"
"x36","with a jet of superheated steam that hissed against the walls, smashed"
"x36","all the windows it touched, and scalded the curate's hand as he fled"
"x36","out of the front room.  When at last we crept across the sodden rooms"
"x36","and looked out again, the country northward was as though a black"
"x36","snowstorm had passed over it.  Looking towards the river, we were"
"x36","astonished to see an unaccountable redness mingling with the black of"
"x36","the scorched meadows."
"x36",""
"x36","For a time we did not see how this change affected our position,"
"x36","save that we were relieved of our fear of the Black Smoke.  But later"
"x36","I perceived that we were no longer hemmed in, that now we might get"
"x36","away.  So soon as I realised that the way of escape was open, my dream"
"x36","of action returned.  But the curate was lethargic, unreasonable."
"x36",""
"x36","""We are safe here,"" he repeated; ""safe here."""
"x36",""
"x36","I resolved to leave him--would that I had!  Wiser now for the"
"x36","artilleryman's teaching, I sought out food and drink.  I had found oil"
"x36","and rags for my burns, and I also took a hat and a flannel shirt that"
"x36","I found in one of the bedrooms.  When it was clear to him that I meant"
"x36","to go alone--had reconciled myself to going alone--he suddenly roused"
"x36","himself to come.  And all being quiet throughout the afternoon, we"
"x36","started about five o'clock, as I should judge, along the blackened"
"x36","road to Sunbury."
"x36",""
"x36","In Sunbury, and at intervals along the road, were dead bodies lying"
"x36","in contorted attitudes, horses as well as men, overturned carts and"
"x36","luggage, all covered thickly with black dust.  That pall of cindery"
"x36","powder made me think of what I had read of the destruction of Pompeii."
"x36","We got to Hampton Court without misadventure, our minds full of"
"x36","strange and unfamiliar appearances, and at Hampton Court our eyes were"
"x36","relieved to find a patch of green that had escaped the suffocating"
"x36","drift.  We went through Bushey Park, with its deer going to and fro"
"x36","under the chestnuts, and some men and women hurrying in the distance"
"x36","towards Hampton, and so we came to Twickenham.  These were the first"
"x36","people we saw."
"x36",""
"x36","Away across the road the woods beyond Ham and Petersham were still"
"x36","afire.  Twickenham was uninjured by either Heat-Ray or Black Smoke,"
"x36","and there were more people about here, though none could give us news."
"x36","For the most part they were like ourselves, taking advantage of a lull"
"x36","to shift their quarters.  I have an impression that many of the houses"
"x36","here were still occupied by scared inhabitants, too frightened even"
"x36","for flight.  Here too the evidence of a hasty rout was abundant along"
"x36","the road.  I remember most vividly three smashed bicycles in a heap,"
"x36","pounded into the road by the wheels of subsequent carts.  We crossed"
"x36","Richmond Bridge about half past eight.  We hurried across the exposed"
"x36","bridge, of course, but I noticed floating down the stream a number"
"x36","of red masses, some many feet across.  I did not know what these"
"x36","were--there was no time for scrutiny--and I put a more horrible"
"x36","interpretation on them than they deserved.  Here again on the Surrey"
"x36","side were black dust that had once been smoke, and dead bodies--a heap"
"x36","near the approach to the station; but we had no glimpse of the"
"x36","Martians until we were some way towards Barnes."
"x36",""
"x36","We saw in the blackened distance a group of three people running"
"x36","down a side street towards the river, but otherwise it seemed"
"x36","deserted.  Up the hill Richmond town was burning briskly; outside the"
"x36","town of Richmond there was no trace of the Black Smoke."
"x36",""
"x36","Then suddenly, as we approached Kew, came a number of people"
"x36","running, and the upperworks of a Martian fighting-machine loomed in"
"x36","sight over the housetops, not a hundred yards away from us.  We stood"
"x36","aghast at our danger, and had the Martian looked down we must"
"x36","immediately have perished.  We were so terrified that we dared not go"
"x36","on, but turned aside and hid in a shed in a garden.  There the curate"
"x36","crouched, weeping silently, and refusing to stir again."
"x36",""
"x36","But my fixed idea of reaching Leatherhead would not let me rest,"
"x36","and in the twilight I ventured out again.  I went through a shrubbery,"
"x36","and along a passage beside a big house standing in its own grounds,"
"x36","and so emerged upon the road towards Kew.  The curate I left in the"
"x36","shed, but he came hurrying after me."
"x36",""
"x36","That second start was the most foolhardy thing I ever did.  For it"
"x36","was manifest the Martians were about us.  No sooner had the curate"
"x36","overtaken me than we saw either the fighting-machine we had seen"
"x36","before or another, far away across the meadows in the direction of Kew"
"x36","Lodge.  Four or five little black figures hurried before it across the"
"x36","green-grey of the field, and in a moment it was evident this Martian"
"x36","pursued them.  In three strides he was among them, and they ran"
"x36","radiating from his feet in all directions.  He used no Heat-Ray to"
"x36","destroy them, but picked them up one by one.  Apparently he tossed"
"x36","them into the great metallic carrier which projected behind him, much"
"x36","as a workman's basket hangs over his shoulder."
"x36",""
"x36","It was the first time I realised that the Martians might have any"
"x36","other purpose than destruction with defeated humanity.  We stood for a"
"x36","moment petrified, then turned and fled through a gate behind us into a"
"x36","walled garden, fell into, rather than found, a fortunate ditch, and"
"x36","lay there, scarce daring to whisper to each other until the stars were"
"x36","out."
"x36",""
"x36","I suppose it was nearly eleven o'clock before we gathered courage"
"x36","to start again, no longer venturing into the road, but sneaking along"
"x36","hedgerows and through plantations, and watching keenly through the"
"x36","darkness, he on the right and I on the left, for the Martians, who"
"x36","seemed to be all about us.  In one place we blundered upon a scorched"
"x36","and blackened area, now cooling and ashen, and a number of scattered"
"x36","dead bodies of men, burned horribly about the heads and trunks but"
"x36","with their legs and boots mostly intact; and of dead horses, fifty"
"x36","feet, perhaps, behind a line of four ripped guns and smashed gun"
"x36","carriages."
"x36",""
"x36","Sheen, it seemed, had escaped destruction, but the place was silent"
"x36","and deserted.  Here we happened on no dead, though the night was too"
"x36","dark for us to see into the side roads of the place.  In Sheen my"
"x36","companion suddenly complained of faintness and thirst, and we decided"
"x36","to try one of the houses."
"x36",""
"x36","The first house we entered, after a little difficulty with the"
"x36","window, was a small semi-detached villa, and I found nothing eatable"
"x36","left in the place but some mouldy cheese.  There was, however, water"
"x36","to drink; and I took a hatchet, which promised to be useful in our"
"x36","next house-breaking."
"x36",""
"x36","We then crossed to a place where the road turns towards Mortlake."
"x36","Here there stood a white house within a walled garden, and in the"
"x36","pantry of this domicile we found a store of food--two loaves of bread"
"x36","in a pan, an uncooked steak, and the half of a ham.  I give this"
"x36","catalogue so precisely because, as it happened, we were destined to"
"x36","subsist upon this store for the next fortnight.  Bottled beer stood"
"x36","under a shelf, and there were two bags of haricot beans and some limp"
"x36","lettuces.  This pantry opened into a kind of wash-up kitchen, and in"
"x36","this was firewood; there was also a cupboard, in which we found nearly"
"x36","a dozen of burgundy, tinned soups and salmon, and two tins of"
"x36","biscuits."
"x36",""
"x36","We sat in the adjacent kitchen in the dark--for we dared not strike"
"x36","a light--and ate bread and ham, and drank beer out of the same bottle."
"x36","The curate, who was still timorous and restless, was now, oddly"
"x36","enough, for pushing on, and I was urging him to keep up his strength"
"x36","by eating when the thing happened that was to imprison us."
"x36",""
"x36","""It can't be midnight yet,"" I said, and then came a blinding glare"
"x36","of vivid green light.  Everything in the kitchen leaped out, clearly"
"x36","visible in green and black, and vanished again.  And then followed such"
"x36","a concussion as I have never heard before or since.  So close on the"
"x36","heels of this as to seem instantaneous came a thud behind me, a clash"
"x36","of glass, a crash and rattle of falling masonry all about us, and the"
"x36","plaster of the ceiling came down upon us, smashing into a multitude of"
"x36","fragments upon our heads.  I was knocked headlong across the floor"
"x36","against the oven handle and stunned.  I was insensible for a long"
"x36","time, the curate told me, and when I came to we were in darkness"
"x36","again, and he, with a face wet, as I found afterwards, with blood from"
"x36","a cut forehead, was dabbing water over me."
"x36",""
"x36","For some time I could not recollect what had happened.  Then things"
"x36","came to me slowly.  A bruise on my temple asserted itself."
"x36",""
"x36","""Are you better?"" asked the curate in a whisper."
"x36",""
"x36","At last I answered him.  I sat up."
"x36",""
"x36","""Don't move,"" he said.  ""The floor is covered with smashed crockery"
"x36","from the dresser.  You can't possibly move without making a noise, and"
"x36","I fancy _they_ are outside."""
"x36",""
"x36","We both sat quite silent, so that we could scarcely hear each other"
"x36","breathing.  Everything seemed deadly still, but once something near"
"x36","us, some plaster or broken brickwork, slid down with a rumbling sound."
"x36","Outside and very near was an intermittent, metallic rattle."
"x36",""
"x36","""That!"" said the curate, when presently it happened again."
"x36",""
"x36","""Yes,"" I said.  ""But what is it?"""
"x36",""
"x36","""A Martian!"" said the curate."
"x36",""
"x36","I listened again."
"x36",""
"x36","""It was not like the Heat-Ray,"" I said, and for a time I was"
"x36","inclined to think one of the great fighting-machines had stumbled"
"x36","against the house, as I had seen one stumble against the tower of"
"x36","Shepperton Church."
"x36",""
"x36","Our situation was so strange and incomprehensible that for three or"
"x36","four hours, until the dawn came, we scarcely moved.  And then the light"
"x36","filtered in, not through the window, which remained black, but through"
"x36","a triangular aperture between a beam and a heap of broken bricks in"
"x36","the wall behind us.  The interior of the kitchen we now saw greyly for"
"x36","the first time."
"x36",""
"x36","The window had been burst in by a mass of garden mould, which"
"x36","flowed over the table upon which we had been sitting and lay about our"
"x36","feet.  Outside, the soil was banked high against the house.  At the"
"x36","top of the window frame we could see an uprooted drainpipe.  The floor"
"x36","was littered with smashed hardware; the end of the kitchen towards the"
"x36","house was broken into, and since the daylight shone in there, it was"
"x36","evident the greater part of the house had collapsed.  Contrasting"
"x36","vividly with this ruin was the neat dresser, stained in the fashion,"
"x36","pale green, and with a number of copper and tin vessels below it, the"
"x36","wallpaper imitating blue and white tiles, and a couple of coloured"
"x36","supplements fluttering from the walls above the kitchen range."
"x36",""
"x36","As the dawn grew clearer, we saw through the gap in the wall the"
"x36","body of a Martian, standing sentinel, I suppose, over the still"
"x36","glowing cylinder.  At the sight of that we crawled as circumspectly as"
"x36","possible out of the twilight of the kitchen into the darkness of the"
"x36","scullery."
"x36",""
"x36","Abruptly the right interpretation dawned upon my mind."
"x36",""
"x36","""The fifth cylinder,"" I whispered, ""the fifth shot from Mars, has"
"x36","struck this house and buried us under the ruins!"""
"x36",""
"x36","For a time the curate was silent, and then he whispered:"
"x36",""
"x36","""God have mercy upon us!"""
"x36",""
"x36","I heard him presently whimpering to himself."
"x36",""
"x36","Save for that sound we lay quite still in the scullery; I for my"
"x36","part scarce dared breathe, and sat with my eyes fixed on the faint"
"x36","light of the kitchen door.  I could just see the curate's face, a dim,"
"x36","oval shape, and his collar and cuffs.  Outside there began a metallic"
"x36","hammering, then a violent hooting, and then again, after a quiet"
"x36","interval, a hissing like the hissing of an engine.  These noises, for"
"x36","the most part problematical, continued intermittently, and seemed if"
"x36","anything to increase in number as time wore on.  Presently a measured"
"x36","thudding and a vibration that made everything about us quiver and the"
"x36","vessels in the pantry ring and shift, began and continued.  Once the"
"x36","light was eclipsed, and the ghostly kitchen doorway became absolutely"
"x36","dark.  For many hours we must have crouched there, silent and"
"x36","shivering, until our tired attention failed. . . ."
"x36",""
"x36","At last I found myself awake and very hungry.  I am inclined to"
"x36","believe we must have spent the greater portion of a day before that"
"x36","awakening.  My hunger was at a stride so insistent that it moved me to"
"x36","action.  I told the curate I was going to seek food, and felt my way"
"x36","towards the pantry.  He made me no answer, but so soon as I began"
"x36","eating the faint noise I made stirred him up and I heard him crawling"
"x36","after me."

"x36","After eating we crept back to the scullery, and there I must have"
"x36","dozed again, for when presently I looked round I was alone.  The"
"x36","thudding vibration continued with wearisome persistence.  I whispered"
"x36","for the curate several times, and at last felt my way to the door of"
"x36","the kitchen.  It was still daylight, and I perceived him across the"
"x36","room, lying against the triangular hole that looked out upon the"
"x36","Martians.  His shoulders were hunched, so that his head was hidden"
"x36","from me."
"x36",""
"x36","I could hear a number of noises almost like those in an engine"
"x36","shed; and the place rocked with that beating thud.  Through the"
"x36","aperture in the wall I could see the top of a tree touched with gold"
"x36","and the warm blue of a tranquil evening sky.  For a minute or so I"
"x36","remained watching the curate, and then I advanced, crouching and"
"x36","stepping with extreme care amid the broken crockery that littered the"
"x36","floor."
"x36",""
"x36","I touched the curate's leg, and he started so violently that a mass"
"x36","of plaster went sliding down outside and fell with a loud impact.  I"
"x36","gripped his arm, fearing he might cry out, and for a long time we"
"x36","crouched motionless.  Then I turned to see how much of our rampart"
"x36","remained.  The detachment of the plaster had left a vertical slit open"
"x36","in the debris, and by raising myself cautiously across a beam I was"
"x36","able to see out of this gap into what had been overnight a quiet"
"x36","suburban roadway.  Vast, indeed, was the change that we beheld."
"x36",""
"x36","The fifth cylinder must have fallen right into the midst of the"
"x36","house we had first visited.  The building had vanished, completely"
"x36","smashed, pulverised, and dispersed by the blow.  The cylinder lay now"
"x36","far beneath the original foundations--deep in a hole, already vastly"
"x36","larger than the pit I had looked into at Woking.  The earth all round"
"x36","it had splashed under that tremendous impact--""splashed"" is the only"
"x36","word--and lay in heaped piles that hid the masses of the adjacent"
"x36","houses.  It had behaved exactly like mud under the violent blow of a"
"x36","hammer.  Our house had collapsed backward; the front portion, even on"
"x36","the ground floor, had been destroyed completely; by a chance the"
"x36","kitchen and scullery had escaped, and stood buried now under soil and"
"x36","ruins, closed in by tons of earth on every side save towards the"
"x36","cylinder.  Over that aspect we hung now on the very edge of the great"
"x36","circular pit the Martians were engaged in making.  The heavy beating"
"x36","sound was evidently just behind us, and ever and again a bright green"
"x36","vapour drove up like a veil across our peephole."
"x36",""
"x36","The cylinder was already opened in the centre of the pit, and on"
"x36","the farther edge of the pit, amid the smashed and gravel-heaped"
"x36","shrubbery, one of the great fighting-machines, deserted by its"
"x36","occupant, stood stiff and tall against the evening sky.  At first I"
"x36","scarcely noticed the pit and the cylinder, although it has been"
"x36","convenient to describe them first, on account of the extraordinary"
"x36","glittering mechanism I saw busy in the excavation, and on account of"
"x36","the strange creatures that were crawling slowly and painfully across"
"x36","the heaped mould near it."
"x36",""
"x36","The mechanism it certainly was that held my attention first.  It"
"x36","was one of those complicated fabrics that have since been called"
"x36","handling-machines, and the study of which has already given such an"
"x36","enormous impetus to terrestrial invention.  As it dawned upon me"
"x36","first, it presented a sort of metallic spider with five jointed,"
"x36","agile legs, and with an extraordinary number of jointed levers, bars,"
"x36","and reaching and clutching tentacles about its body.  Most of its"
"x36","arms were retracted, but with three long tentacles it was fishing"
"x36","out a number of rods, plates, and bars which lined the covering and"
"x36","apparently strengthened the walls of the cylinder.  These, as it"
"x36","extracted them, were lifted out and deposited upon a level surface"
"x36","of earth behind it."
"x36",""
"x36","Its motion was so swift, complex, and perfect that at first I did"
"x36","not see it as a machine, in spite of its metallic glitter.  The"
"x36","fighting-machines were coordinated and animated to an extraordinary"
"x36","pitch, but nothing to compare with this.  People who have never seen"
"x36","these structures, and have only the ill-imagined efforts of artists or"
"x36","the imperfect descriptions of such eye-witnesses as myself to go upon,"
"x36","scarcely realise that living quality."
"x36",""
"x36","I recall particularly the illustration of one of the first"
"x36","pamphlets to give a consecutive account of the war.  The artist had"
"x36","evidently made a hasty study of one of the fighting-machines, and"
"x36","there his knowledge ended.  He presented them as tilted, stiff"
"x36","tripods, without either flexibility or subtlety, and with an"
"x36","altogether misleading monotony of effect.  The pamphlet containing"
"x36","these renderings had a considerable vogue, and I mention them here"
"x36","simply to warn the reader against the impression they may have"
"x36","created.  They were no more like the Martians I saw in action than a"
"x36","Dutch doll is like a human being.  To my mind, the pamphlet would have"
"x36","been much better without them."
"x36",""
"x36","At first, I say, the handling-machine did not impress me as a"
"x36","machine, but as a crablike creature with a glittering integument, the"
"x36","controlling Martian whose delicate tentacles actuated its movements"
"x36","seeming to be simply the equivalent of the crab's cerebral portion."
"x36","But then I perceived the resemblance of its grey-brown, shiny,"
"x36","leathery integument to that of the other sprawling bodies beyond, and"
"x36","the true nature of this dexterous workman dawned upon me.  With that"
"x36","realisation my interest shifted to those other creatures, the real"
"x36","Martians.  Already I had had a transient impression of these, and the"
"x36","first nausea no longer obscured my observation.  Moreover, I was"
"x36","concealed and motionless, and under no urgency of action."
"x36",""
"x36","They were, I now saw, the most unearthly creatures it is possible"
"x36","to conceive.  They were huge round bodies--or, rather, heads--about"
"x36","four feet in diameter, each body having in front of it a face.  This"
"x36","face had no nostrils--indeed, the Martians do not seem to have had any"
"x36","sense of smell, but it had a pair of very large dark-coloured eyes,"
"x36","and just beneath this a kind of fleshy beak.  In the back of this head"
"x36","or body--I scarcely know how to speak of it--was the single tight"
"x36","tympanic surface, since known to be anatomically an ear, though it"
"x36","must have been almost useless in our dense air.  In a group round the"
"x36","mouth were sixteen slender, almost whiplike tentacles, arranged in two"
"x36","bunches of eight each.  These bunches have since been named rather"
"x36","aptly, by that distinguished anatomist, Professor Howes, the _hands_."
"x36","Even as I saw these Martians for the first time they seemed to be"
"x36","endeavouring to raise themselves on these hands, but of course, with"
"x36","the increased weight of terrestrial conditions, this was impossible."
"x36","There is reason to suppose that on Mars they may have progressed upon"
"x36","them with some facility."
"x36",""
"x36","The internal anatomy, I may remark here, as dissection has since"
"x36","shown, was almost equally simple.  The greater part of the structure"
"x36","was the brain, sending enormous nerves to the eyes, ear, and tactile"
"x36","tentacles.  Besides this were the bulky lungs, into which the mouth"
"x36","opened, and the heart and its vessels.  The pulmonary distress caused"
"x36","by the denser atmosphere and greater gravitational attraction was only"
"x36","too evident in the convulsive movements of the outer skin."
"x36",""
"x36","And this was the sum of the Martian organs.  Strange as it may seem"
"x36","to a human being, all the complex apparatus of digestion, which makes"
"x36","up the bulk of our bodies, did not exist in the Martians.  They were"
"x36","heads--merely heads.  Entrails they had none.  They did not eat, much"
"x36","less digest.  Instead, they took the fresh, living blood of other"
"x36","creatures, and _injected_ it into their own veins.  I have myself seen"
"x36","this being done, as I shall mention in its place.  But, squeamish as I"
"x36","may seem, I cannot bring myself to describe what I could not endure"
"x36","even to continue watching.  Let it suffice to say, blood obtained from"
"x36","a still living animal, in most cases from a human being, was run"
"x36","directly by means of a little pipette into the recipient canal. . . ."
"x36",""
"x36","The bare idea of this is no doubt horribly repulsive to us, but at"
"x36","the same time I think that we should remember how repulsive our"
"x36","carnivorous habits would seem to an intelligent rabbit."
"x36",""
"x36","The physiological advantages of the practice of injection are"
"x36","undeniable, if one thinks of the tremendous waste of human time and"
"x36","energy occasioned by eating and the digestive process.  Our bodies are"
"x36","half made up of glands and tubes and organs, occupied in turning"
"x36","heterogeneous food into blood.  The digestive processes and their"
"x36","reaction upon the nervous system sap our strength and colour our"
"x36","minds.  Men go happy or miserable as they have healthy or unhealthy"
"x36","livers, or sound gastric glands.  But the Martians were lifted above"
"x36","all these organic fluctuations of mood and emotion."
"x36",""
"x36","Their undeniable preference for men as their source of nourishment"
"x36","is partly explained by the nature of the remains of the victims they"
"x36","had brought with them as provisions from Mars.  These creatures, to"
"x36","judge from the shrivelled remains that have fallen into human hands,"
"x36","were bipeds with flimsy, silicious skeletons (almost like those of the"
"x36","silicious sponges) and feeble musculature, standing about six feet"
"x36","high and having round, erect heads, and large eyes in flinty sockets."
"x36","Two or three of these seem to have been brought in each cylinder, and"
"x36","all were killed before earth was reached.  It was just as well for"
"x36","them, for the mere attempt to stand upright upon our planet would have"
"x36","broken every bone in their bodies."
"x36",""
"x36","And while I am engaged in this description, I may add in this place"
"x36","certain further details which, although they were not all evident to"
"x36","us at the time, will enable the reader who is unacquainted with them"
"x36","to form a clearer picture of these offensive creatures."
"x36",""
"x36","In three other points their physiology differed strangely from"
"x36","ours.  Their organisms did not sleep, any more than the heart of man"
"x36","sleeps.  Since they had no extensive muscular mechanism to recuperate,"
"x36","that periodical extinction was unknown to them.  They had little or"
"x36","no sense of fatigue, it would seem.  On earth they could never have"
"x36","moved without effort, yet even to the last they kept in action.  In"
"x36","twenty-four hours they did twenty-four hours of work, as even on earth"
"x36","is perhaps the case with the ants."
"x36",""
"x36","In the next place, wonderful as it seems in a sexual world, the"
"x36","Martians were absolutely without sex, and therefore without any of the"
"x36","tumultuous emotions that arise from that difference among men.  A"
"x36","young Martian, there can now be no dispute, was really born upon earth"
"x36","during the war, and it was found attached to its parent, partially"
"x36","_budded_ off, just as young lilybulbs bud off, or like the young animals"
"x36","in the fresh-water polyp."
"x36",""
"x36","In man, in all the higher terrestrial animals, such a method of"
"x36","increase has disappeared; but even on this earth it was certainly the"
"x36","primitive method.  Among the lower animals, up even to those first"
"x36","cousins of the vertebrated animals, the Tunicates, the two processes"
"x36","occur side by side, but finally the sexual method superseded its"
"x36","competitor altogether.  On Mars, however, just the reverse has"
"x36","apparently been the case."
"x36",""
"x36","It is worthy of remark that a certain speculative writer of"
"x36","quasi-scientific repute, writing long before the Martian invasion, did"
"x36","forecast for man a final structure not unlike the actual Martian"
"x36","condition.  His prophecy, I remember, appeared in November or"
"x36","December, 1893, in a long-defunct publication, the _Pall Mall Budget_,"
"x36","and I recall a caricature of it in a pre-Martian periodical called"
"x36","_Punch_.  He pointed out--writing in a foolish, facetious tone--that the"
"x36","perfection of mechanical appliances must ultimately supersede limbs;"
"x36","the perfection of chemical devices, digestion; that such organs as"
"x36","hair, external nose, teeth, ears, and chin were no longer essential"
"x36","parts of the human being, and that the tendency of natural selection"
"x36","would lie in the direction of their steady diminution through the"
"x36","coming ages.  The brain alone remained a cardinal necessity.  Only one"
"x36","other part of the body had a strong case for survival, and that was"
"x36","the hand, ""teacher and agent of the brain.""  While the rest of the"
"x36","body dwindled, the hands would grow larger."
"x36",""
"x36","There is many a true word written in jest, and here in the Martians"
"x36","we have beyond dispute the actual accomplishment of such a suppression"
"x36","of the animal side of the organism by the intelligence.  To me it is"
"x36","quite credible that the Martians may be descended from beings not"
"x36","unlike ourselves, by a gradual development of brain and hands (the"
"x36","latter giving rise to the two bunches of delicate tentacles at last)"
"x36","at the expense of the rest of the body.  Without the body the brain"
"x36","would, of course, become a mere selfish intelligence, without any of"
"x36","the emotional substratum of the human being."
"x36",""
"x36","The last salient point in which the systems of these creatures"
"x36","differed from ours was in what one might have thought a very trivial"
"x36","particular.  Micro-organisms, which cause so much disease and pain on"
"x36","earth, have either never appeared upon Mars or Martian sanitary"
"x36","science eliminated them ages ago.  A hundred diseases, all the fevers"
"x36","and contagions of human life, consumption, cancers, tumours and such"
"x36","morbidities, never enter the scheme of their life.  And speaking of"
"x36","the differences between the life on Mars and terrestrial life, I may"
"x36","allude here to the curious suggestions of the red weed."
"x36",""
"x36","Apparently the vegetable kingdom in Mars, instead of having green"
"x36","for a dominant colour, is of a vivid blood-red tint.  At any rate, the"
"x36","seeds which the Martians (intentionally or accidentally) brought with"
"x36","them gave rise in all cases to red-coloured growths.  Only that known"
"x36","popularly as the red weed, however, gained any footing in competition"
"x36","with terrestrial forms.  The red creeper was quite a transitory"
"x36","growth, and few people have seen it growing.  For a time, however, the"
"x36","red weed grew with astonishing vigour and luxuriance.  It spread up"
"x36","the sides of the pit by the third or fourth day of our imprisonment,"
"x36","and its cactus-like branches formed a carmine fringe to the edges of"
"x36","our triangular window.  And afterwards I found it broadcast throughout"
"x36","the country, and especially wherever there was a stream of water."
"x36",""
"x36","The Martians had what appears to have been an auditory organ, a"
"x36","single round drum at the back of the head-body, and eyes with a visual"
"x36","range not very different from ours except that, according to Philips,"
"x36","blue and violet were as black to them.  It is commonly supposed that"
"x36","they communicated by sounds and tentacular gesticulations; this is"
"x36","asserted, for instance, in the able but hastily compiled pamphlet"
"x36","(written evidently by someone not an eye-witness of Martian actions)"
"x36","to which I have already alluded, and which, so far, has been the chief"
"x36","source of information concerning them.  Now no surviving human being"
"x36","saw so much of the Martians in action as I did.  I take no credit to"
"x36","myself for an accident, but the fact is so.  And I assert that I"
"x36","watched them closely time after time, and that I have seen four, five,"
"x36","and (once) six of them sluggishly performing the most elaborately"
"x36","complicated operations together without either sound or gesture.  Their"
"x36","peculiar hooting invariably preceded feeding; it had no modulation,"
"x36","and was, I believe, in no sense a signal, but merely the expiration of"
"x36","air preparatory to the suctional operation.  I have a certain claim to"
"x36","at least an elementary knowledge of psychology, and in this matter I"
"x36","am convinced--as firmly as I am convinced of anything--that the"
"x36","Martians interchanged thoughts without any physical intermediation."
"x36","And I have been convinced of this in spite of strong preconceptions."
"x36","Before the Martian invasion, as an occasional reader here or there may"
"x36","remember, I had written with some little vehemence against the"
"x36","telepathic theory."
"x36",""
"x36","The Martians wore no clothing.  Their conceptions of ornament and"
"x36","decorum were necessarily different from ours; and not only were they"
"x36","evidently much less sensible of changes of temperature than we are,"
"x36","but changes of pressure do not seem to have affected their health at"
"x36","all seriously.  Yet though they wore no clothing, it was in the other"
"x36","artificial additions to their bodily resources that their great"
"x36","superiority over man lay.  We men, with our bicycles and road-skates,"
"x36","our Lilienthal soaring-machines, our guns and sticks and so forth, are"
"x36","just in the beginning of the evolution that the Martians have worked"
"x36","out.  They have become practically mere brains, wearing different"
"x36","bodies according to their needs just as men wear suits of clothes and"
"x36","take a bicycle in a hurry or an umbrella in the wet.  And of their"
"x36","appliances, perhaps nothing is more wonderful to a man than the"
"x36","curious fact that what is the dominant feature of almost all human"
"x36","devices in mechanism is absent--the _wheel_ is absent; among all the"
"x36","things they brought to earth there is no trace or suggestion of their"
"x36","use of wheels.  One would have at least expected it in locomotion.  And"
"x36","in this connection it is curious to remark that even on this earth"
"x36","Nature has never hit upon the wheel, or has preferred other expedients"
"x36","to its development.  And not only did the Martians either not know of"
"x36","(which is incredible), or abstain from, the wheel, but in their"
"x36","apparatus singularly little use is made of the fixed pivot or"
"x36","relatively fixed pivot, with circular motions thereabout confined"
"x36","to one plane.  Almost all the joints of the machinery present a"
"x36","complicated system of sliding parts moving over small but beautifully"
"x36","curved friction bearings.  And while upon this matter of detail, it is"
"x36","remarkable that the long leverages of their machines are in most cases"
"x36","actuated by a sort of sham musculature of the disks in an elastic"
"x36","sheath; these disks become polarised and drawn closely and powerfully"
"x36","together when traversed by a current of electricity.  In this way the"
"x36","curious parallelism to animal motions, which was so striking and"
"x36","disturbing to the human beholder, was attained.  Such quasi-muscles"
"x36","abounded in the crablike handling-machine which, on my first peeping"
"x36","out of the slit, I watched unpacking the cylinder.  It seemed"
"x36","infinitely more alive than the actual Martians lying beyond it in the"
"x36","sunset light, panting, stirring ineffectual tentacles, and moving"
"x36","feebly after their vast journey across space."
"x36",""
"x36","While I was still watching their sluggish motions in the sunlight,"
"x36","and noting each strange detail of their form, the curate reminded me"
"x36","of his presence by pulling violently at my arm.  I turned to a"
"x36","scowling face, and silent, eloquent lips.  He wanted the slit, which"
"x36","permitted only one of us to peep through; and so I had to forego"
"x36","watching them for a time while he enjoyed that privilege."
"x36",""
"x36","When I looked again, the busy handling-machine had already put"
"x36","together several of the pieces of apparatus it had taken out of the"
"x36","cylinder into a shape having an unmistakable likeness to its own; and"
"x36","down on the left a busy little digging mechanism had come into view,"
"x36","emitting jets of green vapour and working its way round the pit,"
"x36","excavating and embanking in a methodical and discriminating manner."
"x36","This it was which had caused the regular beating noise, and the"
"x36","rhythmic shocks that had kept our ruinous refuge quivering.  It piped"
"x36","and whistled as it worked.  So far as I could see, the thing was"
"x36","without a directing Martian at all."

"x36","CHAPTER THREE"
"x36",""
"x36","THE DAYS OF IMPRISONMENT"
"x36",""
"x36",""
"x36","The arrival of a second fighting-machine drove us from our peephole"
"x36","into the scullery, for we feared that from his elevation the Martian"
"x36","might see down upon us behind our barrier.  At a later date we began"
"x36","to feel less in danger of their eyes, for to an eye in the dazzle of"
"x36","the sunlight outside our refuge must have been blank blackness, but at"
"x36","first the slightest suggestion of approach drove us into the scullery"
"x36","in heart-throbbing retreat.  Yet terrible as was the danger we"
"x36","incurred, the attraction of peeping was for both of us irresistible."
"x36","And I recall now with a sort of wonder that, in spite of the infinite"
"x36","danger in which we were between starvation and a still more terrible"
"x36","death, we could yet struggle bitterly for that horrible privilege of"
"x36","sight.  We would race across the kitchen in a grotesque way between"
"x36","eagerness and the dread of making a noise, and strike each other, and"
"x36","thrust and kick, within a few inches of exposure."
"x36",""
"x36","The fact is that we had absolutely incompatible dispositions and"
"x36","habits of thought and action, and our danger and isolation only"
"x36","accentuated the incompatibility.  At Halliford I had already come to"
"x36","hate the curate's trick of helpless exclamation, his stupid rigidity"
"x36","of mind.  His endless muttering monologue vitiated every effort I made"
"x36","to think out a line of action, and drove me at times, thus pent up and"
"x36","intensified, almost to the verge of craziness.  He was as lacking in"
"x36","restraint as a silly woman.  He would weep for hours together, and I"
"x36","verily believe that to the very end this spoiled child of life thought"
"x36","his weak tears in some way efficacious.  And I would sit in the"
"x36","darkness unable to keep my mind off him by reason of his"
"x36","importunities.  He ate more than I did, and it was in vain I pointed"
"x36","out that our only chance of life was to stop in the house until the"
"x36","Martians had done with their pit, that in that long patience a time"
"x36","might presently come when we should need food.  He ate and drank"
"x36","impulsively in heavy meals at long intervals.  He slept little."
"x36",""
"x36","As the days wore on, his utter carelessness of any consideration so"
"x36","intensified our distress and danger that I had, much as I loathed"
"x36","doing it, to resort to threats, and at last to blows.  That brought him"
"x36","to reason for a time.  But he was one of those weak creatures, void of"
"x36","pride, timorous, anaemic, hateful souls, full of shifty cunning, who"
"x36","face neither God nor man, who face not even themselves."
"x36",""
"x36","It is disagreeable for me to recall and write these things, but I"
"x36","set them down that my story may lack nothing.  Those who have escaped"
"x36","the dark and terrible aspects of life will find my brutality, my flash"
"x36","of rage in our final tragedy, easy enough to blame; for they know what"
"x36","is wrong as well as any, but not what is possible to tortured men.  But"
"x36","those who have been under the shadow, who have gone down at last to"
"x36","elemental things, will have a wider charity."
"x36",""
"x36","And while within we fought out our dark, dim contest of whispers,"
"x36","snatched food and drink, and gripping hands and blows, without, in the"
"x36","pitiless sunlight of that terrible June, was the strange wonder, the"
"x36","unfamiliar routine of the Martians in the pit.  Let me return to those"
"x36","first new experiences of mine.  After a long time I ventured back to"
"x36","the peephole, to find that the new-comers had been reinforced by the"
"x36","occupants of no fewer than three of the fighting-machines.  These last"
"x36","had brought with them certain fresh appliances that stood in an"
"x36","orderly manner about the cylinder.  The second handling-machine was now"
"x36","completed, and was busied in serving one of the novel contrivances the"
"x36","big machine had brought.  This was a body resembling a milk can in its"
"x36","general form, above which oscillated a pear-shaped receptacle, and"
"x36","from which a stream of white powder flowed into a circular basin"
"x36","below."
"x36",""
"x36","The oscillatory motion was imparted to this by one tentacle of the"
"x36","handling-machine.  With two spatulate hands the handling-machine was"
"x36","digging out and flinging masses of clay into the pear-shaped"
"x36","receptacle above, while with another arm it periodically opened a door"
"x36","and removed rusty and blackened clinkers from the middle part of the"
"x36","machine.  Another steely tentacle directed the powder from the basin"
"x36","along a ribbed channel towards some receiver that was hidden from me"
"x36","by the mound of bluish dust.  From this unseen receiver a little"
"x36","thread of green smoke rose vertically into the quiet air.  As I looked,"
"x36","the handling-machine, with a faint and musical clinking, extended,"
"x36","telescopic fashion, a tentacle that had been a moment before a mere"
"x36","blunt projection, until its end was hidden behind the mound of clay."
"x36","In another second it had lifted a bar of white aluminium into sight,"
"x36","untarnished as yet, and shining dazzlingly, and deposited it in a"
"x36","growing stack of bars that stood at the side of the pit.  Between"
"x36","sunset and starlight this dexterous machine must have made more than a"
"x36","hundred such bars out of the crude clay, and the mound of bluish dust"
"x36","rose steadily until it topped the side of the pit."
"x36",""
"x36","The contrast between the swift and complex movements of these"
"x36","contrivances and the inert panting clumsiness of their masters was"
"x36","acute, and for days I had to tell myself repeatedly that these latter"
"x36","were indeed the living of the two things."
"x36",""
"x36","The curate had possession of the slit when the first men were"
"x36","brought to the pit.  I was sitting below, huddled up, listening with"
"x36","all my ears.  He made a sudden movement backward, and I, fearful that"
"x36","we were observed, crouched in a spasm of terror.  He came sliding down"
"x36","the rubbish and crept beside me in the darkness, inarticulate,"
"x36","gesticulating, and for a moment I shared his panic.  His gesture"
"x36","suggested a resignation of the slit, and after a little while my"
"x36","curiosity gave me courage, and I rose up, stepped across him, and"
"x36","clambered up to it.  At first I could see no reason for his frantic"
"x36","behaviour.  The twilight had now come, the stars were little and"
"x36","faint, but the pit was illuminated by the flickering green fire that"
"x36","came from the aluminium-making.  The whole picture was a flickering"
"x36","scheme of green gleams and shifting rusty black shadows, strangely"
"x36","trying to the eyes.  Over and through it all went the bats, heeding it"
"x36","not at all.  The sprawling Martians were no longer to be seen, the"
"x36","mound of blue-green powder had risen to cover them from sight, and a"
"x36","fighting-machine, with its legs contracted, crumpled, and abbreviated,"
"x36","stood across the corner of the pit.  And then, amid the clangour of"
"x36","the machinery, came a drifting suspicion of human voices, that I"
"x36","entertained at first only to dismiss."
"x36",""
"x36","I crouched, watching this fighting-machine closely, satisfying"
"x36","myself now for the first time that the hood did indeed contain a"
"x36","Martian.  As the green flames lifted I could see the oily gleam of"
"x36","his integument and the brightness of his eyes.  And suddenly I heard"
"x36","a yell, and saw a long tentacle reaching over the shoulder of the"
"x36","machine to the little cage that hunched upon its back.  Then"
"x36","something--something struggling violently--was lifted high against the"
"x36","sky, a black, vague enigma against the starlight; and as this black"
"x36","object came down again, I saw by the green brightness that it was a"
"x36","man.  For an instant he was clearly visible.  He was a stout, ruddy,"
"x36","middle-aged man, well dressed; three days before, he must have been"
"x36","walking the world, a man of considerable consequence.  I could see his"
"x36","staring eyes and gleams of light on his studs and watch chain.  He"
"x36","vanished behind the mound, and for a moment there was silence.  And"
"x36","then began a shrieking and a sustained and cheerful hooting from the"
"x36","Martians."
"x36",""
"x36","I slid down the rubbish, struggled to my feet, clapped my hands"
"x36","over my ears, and bolted into the scullery.  The curate, who had been"
"x36","crouching silently with his arms over his head, looked up as I passed,"
"x36","cried out quite loudly at my desertion of him, and came running after"
"x36","me."
"x36",""
"x36","That night, as we lurked in the scullery, balanced between our"
"x36","horror and the terrible fascination this peeping had, although I felt"
"x36","an urgent need of action I tried in vain to conceive some plan of"
"x36","escape; but afterwards, during the second day, I was able to consider"
"x36","our position with great clearness.  The curate, I found, was quite"
"x36","incapable of discussion; this new and culminating atrocity had robbed"
"x36","him of all vestiges of reason or forethought.  Practically he had"
"x36","already sunk to the level of an animal.  But as the saying goes, I"
"x36","gripped myself with both hands.  It grew upon my mind, once I could"
"x36","face the facts, that terrible as our position was, there was as yet"
"x36","no justification for absolute despair.  Our chief chance lay in the"
"x36","possibility of the Martians making the pit nothing more than a"
"x36","temporary encampment.  Or even if they kept it permanently, they might"
"x36","not consider it necessary to guard it, and a chance of escape might be"
"x36","afforded us.  I also weighed very carefully the possibility of our"
"x36","digging a way out in a direction away from the pit, but the chances of"
"x36","our emerging within sight of some sentinel fighting-machine seemed at"
"x36","first too great.  And I should have had to do all the digging myself."
"x36","The curate would certainly have failed me."
"x36",""
"x36","It was on the third day, if my memory serves me right, that I saw"
"x36","the lad killed.  It was the only occasion on which I actually saw the"
"x36","Martians feed.  After that experience I avoided the hole in the wall"
"x36","for the better part of a day.  I went into the scullery, removed the"
"x36","door, and spent some hours digging with my hatchet as silently as"
"x36","possible; but when I had made a hole about a couple of feet deep the"
"x36","loose earth collapsed noisily, and I did not dare continue.  I lost"
"x36","heart, and lay down on the scullery floor for a long time, having no"
"x36","spirit even to move.  And after that I abandoned altogether the idea"
"x36","of escaping by excavation."
"x36",""
"x36","It says much for the impression the Martians had made upon me that"
"x36","at first I entertained little or no hope of our escape being brought"
"x36","about by their overthrow through any human effort.  But on the fourth"
"x36","or fifth night I heard a sound like heavy guns."
"x36",""
"x36","It was very late in the night, and the moon was shining brightly."
"x36","The Martians had taken away the excavating-machine, and, save for a"
"x36","fighting-machine that stood in the remoter bank of the pit and a"
"x36","handling-machine that was buried out of my sight in a corner of the"
"x36","pit immediately beneath my peephole, the place was deserted by them."
"x36","Except for the pale glow from the handling-machine and the bars and"
"x36","patches of white moonlight the pit was in darkness, and, except for"
"x36","the clinking of the handling-machine, quite still.  That night was a"
"x36","beautiful serenity; save for one planet, the moon seemed to have the"
"x36","sky to herself.  I heard a dog howling, and that familiar sound it was"
"x36","that made me listen.  Then I heard quite distinctly a booming exactly"
"x36","like the sound of great guns.  Six distinct reports I counted, and"
"x36","after a long interval six again.  And that was all."

"x36","CHAPTER FOUR"
"x36",""
"x36","THE DEATH OF THE CURATE"
"x36",""
"x36",""
"x36","It was on the sixth day of our imprisonment that I peeped for the"
"x36","last time, and presently found myself alone.  Instead of keeping close"
"x36","to me and trying to oust me from the slit, the curate had gone back"
"x36","into the scullery.  I was struck by a sudden thought.  I went back"
"x36","quickly and quietly into the scullery.  In the darkness I heard the"
"x36","curate drinking.  I snatched in the darkness, and my fingers caught a"
"x36","bottle of burgundy."
"x36",""
"x36","For a few minutes there was a tussle.  The bottle struck the floor"
"x36","and broke, and I desisted and rose.  We stood panting and threatening"
"x36","each other.  In the end I planted myself between him and the food, and"
"x36","told him of my determination to begin a discipline.  I divided the"
"x36","food in the pantry, into rations to last us ten days.  I would not let"
"x36","him eat any more that day.  In the afternoon he made a feeble effort"
"x36","to get at the food.  I had been dozing, but in an instant I was awake."
"x36","All day and all night we sat face to face, I weary but resolute, and"
"x36","he weeping and complaining of his immediate hunger.  It was, I know, a"
"x36","night and a day, but to me it seemed--it seems now--an interminable"
"x36","length of time."
"x36",""
"x36","And so our widened incompatibility ended at last in open conflict."
"x36","For two vast days we struggled in undertones and wrestling contests."
"x36","There were times when I beat and kicked him madly, times when I"
"x36","cajoled and persuaded him, and once I tried to bribe him with the last"
"x36","bottle of burgundy, for there was a rain-water pump from which I could"
"x36","get water.  But neither force nor kindness availed; he was indeed"
"x36","beyond reason.  He would neither desist from his attacks on the food"
"x36","nor from his noisy babbling to himself.  The rudimentary precautions"
"x36","to keep our imprisonment endurable he would not observe.  Slowly I"
"x36","began to realise the complete overthrow of his intelligence, to"
"x36","perceive that my sole companion in this close and sickly darkness was"
"x36","a man insane."
"x36",""
"x36","From certain vague memories I am inclined to think my own mind"
"x36","wandered at times.  I had strange and hideous dreams whenever I slept."
"x36","It sounds paradoxical, but I am inclined to think that the weakness"
"x36","and insanity of the curate warned me, braced me, and kept me a sane"
"x36","man."
"x36",""
"x36","On the eighth day he began to talk aloud instead of whispering, and"
"x36","nothing I could do would moderate his speech."
"x36",""
"x36","""It is just, O God!"" he would say, over and over again. ""It is"
"x36","just.  On me and mine be the punishment laid.  We have sinned, we have"
"x36","fallen short.  There was poverty, sorrow; the poor were trodden in"
"x36","the dust, and I held my peace.  I preached acceptable folly--my God,"
"x36","what folly!--when I should have stood up, though I died for it, and"
"x36","called upon them to repent--repent! . . .  Oppressors of the poor and"
"x36","needy . . . !  The wine press of God!"""
"x36",""
"x36","Then he would suddenly revert to the matter of the food I withheld"
"x36","from him, praying, begging, weeping, at last threatening.  He began to"
"x36","raise his voice--I prayed him not to.  He perceived a hold on me--he"
"x36","threatened he would shout and bring the Martians upon us.  For a time"
"x36","that scared me; but any concession would have shortened our chance of"
"x36","escape beyond estimating.  I defied him, although I felt no assurance"
"x36","that he might not do this thing.  But that day, at any rate, he did"
"x36","not.  He talked with his voice rising slowly, through the greater part"
"x36","of the eighth and ninth days--threats, entreaties, mingled with a"
"x36","torrent of half-sane and always frothy repentance for his vacant sham"
"x36","of God's service, such as made me pity him.  Then he slept awhile, and"
"x36","began again with renewed strength, so loudly that I must needs make"
"x36","him desist."
"x36",""
"x36","""Be still!"" I implored."
"x36",""
"x36","He rose to his knees, for he had been sitting in the darkness near"
"x36","the copper."
"x36",""
"x36","""I have been still too long,"" he said, in a tone that must have"
"x36","reached the pit, ""and now I must bear my witness.  Woe unto this"
"x36","unfaithful city!  Woe!  Woe!  Woe!  Woe!  Woe! To the inhabitants of"
"x36","the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet----"""
"x36",""
"x36","""Shut up!"" I said, rising to my feet, and in a terror lest the"
"x36","Martians should hear us.  ""For God's sake----"""
"x36",""
"x36","""Nay,"" shouted the curate, at the top of his voice, standing"
"x36","likewise and extending his arms.  ""Speak!  The word of the Lord is"
"x36","upon me!"""
"x36",""
"x36","In three strides he was at the door leading into the kitchen."
"x36",""
"x36","""I must bear my witness!  I go!  It has already been too long"
"x36","delayed."""
"x36",""
"x36","I put out my hand and felt the meat chopper hanging to the wall."
"x36","In a flash I was after him.  I was fierce with fear.  Before he was"
"x36","halfway across the kitchen I had overtaken him.  With one last touch"
"x36","of humanity I turned the blade back and struck him with the butt.  He"
"x36","went headlong forward and lay stretched on the ground.  I stumbled"
"x36","over him and stood panting.  He lay still."
"x36",""
"x36","Suddenly I heard a noise without, the run and smash of slipping"
"x36","plaster, and the triangular aperture in the wall was darkened.  I"
"x36","looked up and saw the lower surface of a handling-machine coming"
"x36","slowly across the hole.  One of its gripping limbs curled amid the"
"x36","debris; another limb appeared, feeling its way over the fallen beams."
"x36","I stood petrified, staring.  Then I saw through a sort of glass plate"
"x36","near the edge of the body the face, as we may call it, and the large"
"x36","dark eyes of a Martian, peering, and then a long metallic snake of"
"x36","tentacle came feeling slowly through the hole."
"x36",""
"x36","I turned by an effort, stumbled over the curate, and stopped at the"
"x36","scullery door.  The tentacle was now some way, two yards or more, in"
"x36","the room, and twisting and turning, with queer sudden movements, this"
"x36","way and that.  For a while I stood fascinated by that slow, fitful"
"x36","advance.  Then, with a faint, hoarse cry, I forced myself across the"
"x36","scullery.  I trembled violently; I could scarcely stand upright.  I"
"x36","opened the door of the coal cellar, and stood there in the darkness"
"x36","staring at the faintly lit doorway into the kitchen, and listening."
"x36","Had the Martian seen me?  What was it doing now?"
"x36",""
"x36","Something was moving to and fro there, very quietly; every now and"
"x36","then it tapped against the wall, or started on its movements with a"
"x36","faint metallic ringing, like the movements of keys on a split-ring."
"x36","Then a heavy body--I knew too well what--was dragged across the floor"
"x36","of the kitchen towards the opening.  Irresistibly attracted, I crept"
"x36","to the door and peeped into the kitchen.  In the triangle of bright"
"x36","outer sunlight I saw the Martian, in its Briareus of a handling-machine,"
"x36","scrutinizing the curate's head.  I thought at once that it would infer"
"x36","my presence from the mark of the blow I had given him."
"x36",""
"x36","I crept back to the coal cellar, shut the door, and began to cover"
"x36","myself up as much as I could, and as noiselessly as possible in the"
"x36","darkness, among the firewood and coal therein.  Every now and then I"
"x36","paused, rigid, to hear if the Martian had thrust its tentacles through"
"x36","the opening again."
"x36",""
"x36","Then the faint metallic jingle returned.  I traced it slowly"
"x36","feeling over the kitchen.  Presently I heard it nearer--in the"
"x36","scullery, as I judged.  I thought that its length might be"
"x36","insufficient to reach me.  I prayed copiously.  It passed, scraping"
"x36","faintly across the cellar door.  An age of almost intolerable suspense"
"x36","intervened; then I heard it fumbling at the latch! It had found the"
"x36","door!  The Martians understood doors!"
"x36",""
"x36","It worried at the catch for a minute, perhaps, and then the door"
"x36","opened."
"x36",""
"x36","In the darkness I could just see the thing--like an elephant's"
"x36","trunk more than anything else--waving towards me and touching and"
"x36","examining the wall, coals, wood and ceiling.  It was like a black worm"
"x36","swaying its blind head to and fro."
"x36",""
"x36","Once, even, it touched the heel of my boot.  I was on the verge of"
"x36","screaming; I bit my hand.  For a time the tentacle was silent.  I"
"x36","could have fancied it had been withdrawn.  Presently, with an abrupt"
"x36","click, it gripped something--I thought it had me!--and seemed to go"
"x36","out of the cellar again.  For a minute I was not sure.  Apparently it"
"x36","had taken a lump of coal to examine."
"x36",""
"x36","I seized the opportunity of slightly shifting my position, which"
"x36","had become cramped, and then listened.  I whispered passionate prayers"
"x36","for safety."
"x36",""
"x36","Then I heard the slow, deliberate sound creeping towards me again."
"x36","Slowly, slowly it drew near, scratching against the walls and tapping"
"x36","the furniture."
"x36",""
"x36","While I was still doubtful, it rapped smartly against the cellar"
"x36","door and closed it.  I heard it go into the pantry, and the biscuit-tins"
"x36","rattled and a bottle smashed, and then came a heavy bump against"
"x36","the cellar door.  Then silence that passed into an infinity of"
"x36","suspense."
"x36",""
"x36","Had it gone?"
"x36",""
"x36","At last I decided that it had."
"x36",""
"x36","It came into the scullery no more; but I lay all the tenth day in"
"x36","the close darkness, buried among coals and firewood, not daring even"
"x36","to crawl out for the drink for which I craved.  It was the eleventh day"
"x36","before I ventured so far from my security."

"x36","THE STILLNESS"
"x36",""
"x36",""
"x36","My first act before I went into the pantry was to fasten the door"
"x36","between the kitchen and the scullery.  But the pantry was empty; every"
"x36","scrap of food had gone.  Apparently, the Martian had taken it all on"
"x36","the previous day.  At that discovery I despaired for the first time.  I"
"x36","took no food, or no drink either, on the eleventh or the twelfth day."
"x36",""
"x36","At first my mouth and throat were parched, and my strength ebbed"
"x36","sensibly.  I sat about in the darkness of the scullery, in a state of"
"x36","despondent wretchedness.  My mind ran on eating.  I thought I had"
"x36","become deaf, for the noises of movement I had been accustomed to hear"
"x36","from the pit had ceased absolutely.  I did not feel strong enough to"
"x36","crawl noiselessly to the peephole, or I would have gone there."
"x36",""
"x36","On the twelfth day my throat was so painful that, taking the chance"
"x36","of alarming the Martians, I attacked the creaking rain-water pump that"
"x36","stood by the sink, and got a couple of glassfuls of blackened and"
"x36","tainted rain water.  I was greatly refreshed by this, and emboldened"
"x36","by the fact that no enquiring tentacle followed the noise of my"
"x36","pumping."
"x36",""
"x36","During these days, in a rambling, inconclusive way, I thought much"
"x36","of the curate and of the manner of his death."
"x36",""
"x36","On the thirteenth day I drank some more water, and dozed and"
"x36","thought disjointedly of eating and of vague impossible plans of"
"x36","escape.  Whenever I dozed I dreamt of horrible phantasms, of the death"
"x36","of the curate, or of sumptuous dinners; but, asleep or awake, I felt a"
"x36","keen pain that urged me to drink again and again.  The light that came"
"x36","into the scullery was no longer grey, but red.  To my disordered"
"x36","imagination it seemed the colour of blood."
"x36",""
"x36","On the fourteenth day I went into the kitchen, and I was surprised"
"x36","to find that the fronds of the red weed had grown right across"
"x36","the hole in the wall, turning the half-light of the place into a"
"x36","crimson-coloured obscurity."
"x36",""
"x36","It was early on the fifteenth day that I heard a curious, familiar"
"x36","sequence of sounds in the kitchen, and, listening, identified it as"
"x36","the snuffing and scratching of a dog.  Going into the kitchen, I saw a"
"x36","dog's nose peering in through a break among the ruddy fronds.  This"
"x36","greatly surprised me.  At the scent of me he barked shortly."
"x36",""
"x36","I thought if I could induce him to come into the place quietly I"
"x36","should be able, perhaps, to kill and eat him; and in any case, it"
"x36","would be advisable to kill him, lest his actions attracted the"
"x36","attention of the Martians."
"x36",""
"x36","I crept forward, saying ""Good dog!"" very softly; but he suddenly"
"x36","withdrew his head and disappeared."

"x36","I listened--I was not deaf--but certainly the pit was still.  I"
"x36","heard a sound like the flutter of a bird's wings, and a hoarse"
"x36","croaking, but that was all."
"x36",""
"x36","For a long while I lay close to the peephole, but not daring to"
"x36","move aside the red plants that obscured it.  Once or twice I heard a"
"x36","faint pitter-patter like the feet of the dog going hither and thither"
"x36","on the sand far below me, and there were more birdlike sounds, but"
"x36","that was all.  At length, encouraged by the silence, I looked out."
"x36",""
"x36","Except in the corner, where a multitude of crows hopped and fought"
"x36","over the skeletons of the dead the Martians had consumed, there was"
"x36","not a living thing in the pit."

"x36","I stared about me, scarcely believing my eyes.  All the machinery"
"x36","had gone.  Save for the big mound of greyish-blue powder in one"
"x36","corner, certain bars of aluminium in another, the black birds, and the"

"x36","afforded a practicable slope to the summit of the ruins.  My chance of"
"x36","escape had come.  I began to tremble."

"x36","I hesitated for some time, and then, in a gust of desperate"

"x36","further a network of red thread scaled the still living stems."

"x36","for its refuse.  A number of other birds hopped about among the ruins."

"x36",""
"x36","THE WORK OF FIFTEEN DAYS"
"x36",""
"x36",""
"x36","For some time I stood tottering on the mound regardless of my"
"x36","safety.  Within that noisome den from which I had emerged I had"
"x36","thought with a narrow intensity only of our immediate security.  I had"
"x36","not realised what had been happening to the world, had not anticipated"
"x36","this startling vision of unfamiliar things.  I had expected to see"
"x36","Sheen in ruins--I found about me the landscape, weird and lurid, of"
"x36","another planet."
"x36",""
"x36","For that moment I touched an emotion beyond the common range of"
"x36","men, yet one that the poor brutes we dominate know only too well.  I"
"x36","felt as a rabbit might feel returning to his burrow and suddenly"
"x36","confronted by the work of a dozen busy navvies digging the foundations"
"x36","of a house.  I felt the first inkling of a thing that presently grew"
"x36","quite clear in my mind, that oppressed me for many days, a sense of"
"x36","dethronement, a persuasion that I was no longer a master, but an"
"x36","animal among the animals, under the Martian heel.  With us it would be"
"x36","as with them, to lurk and watch, to run and hide; the fear and empire"
"x36","of man had passed away."
"x36",""
"x36","But so soon as this strangeness had been realised it passed, and my"
"x36","dominant motive became the hunger of my long and dismal fast.  In the"
"x36","direction away from the pit I saw, beyond a red-covered wall, a patch"
"x36","of garden ground unburied.  This gave me a hint, and I went knee-deep,"
"x36","and sometimes neck-deep, in the red weed.  The density of the"
"x36","weed gave me a reassuring sense of hiding.  The wall was some six feet"
"x36","high, and when I attempted to clamber it I found I could not lift my"
"x36","feet to the crest.  So I went along by the side of it, and came to a"
"x36","corner and a rockwork that enabled me to get to the top, and tumble"
"x36","into the garden I coveted.  Here I found some young onions, a couple"
"x36","of gladiolus bulbs, and a quantity of immature carrots, all of which I"
"x36","secured, and, scrambling over a ruined wall, went on my way through"
"x36","scarlet and crimson trees towards Kew--it was like walking through an"
"x36","avenue of gigantic blood drops--possessed with two ideas: to get more"
"x36","food, and to limp, as soon and as far as my strength permitted, out of"
"x36","this accursed unearthly region of the pit."
"x36",""
"x36","Some way farther, in a grassy place, was a group of mushrooms which"
"x36","also I devoured, and then I came upon a brown sheet of flowing shallow"
"x36","water, where meadows used to be.  These fragments of nourishment served"
"x36","only to whet my hunger.  At first I was surprised at this flood in a"
"x36","hot, dry summer, but afterwards I discovered that it was caused by the"
"x36","tropical exuberance of the red weed.  Directly this extraordinary"
"x36","growth encountered water it straightway became gigantic and of"
"x36","unparalleled fecundity.  Its seeds were simply poured down into the"
"x36","water of the Wey and Thames, and its swiftly growing and Titanic water"
"x36","fronds speedily choked both those rivers."
"x36",""
"x36","At Putney, as I afterwards saw, the bridge was almost lost in a"
"x36","tangle of this weed, and at Richmond, too, the Thames water poured in"
"x36","a broad and shallow stream across the meadows of Hampton and"
"x36","Twickenham.  As the water spread the weed followed them, until the"
"x36","ruined villas of the Thames valley were for a time lost in this red"
"x36","swamp, whose margin I explored, and much of the desolation the"
"x36","Martians had caused was concealed."
"x36",""
"x36","In the end the red weed succumbed almost as quickly as it had"
"x36","spread.  A cankering disease, due, it is believed, to the action of"
"x36","certain bacteria, presently seized upon it.  Now by the action of"
"x36","natural selection, all terrestrial plants have acquired a resisting"
"x36","power against bacterial diseases--they never succumb without a severe"
"x36","struggle, but the red weed rotted like a thing already dead.  The"
"x36","fronds became bleached, and then shrivelled and brittle.  They broke"
"x36","off at the least touch, and the waters that had stimulated their early"
"x36","growth carried their last vestiges out to sea."
"x36",""
"x36","My first act on coming to this water was, of course, to slake my"
"x36","thirst.  I drank a great deal of it and, moved by an impulse, gnawed"
"x36","some fronds of red weed; but they were watery, and had a sickly,"
"x36","metallic taste.  I found the water was sufficiently shallow for me to"
"x36","wade securely, although the red weed impeded my feet a little; but the"
"x36","flood evidently got deeper towards the river, and I turned back to"
"x36","Mortlake.  I managed to make out the road by means of occasional ruins"
"x36","of its villas and fences and lamps, and so presently I got out of this"
"x36","spate and made my way to the hill going up towards Roehampton and came"
"x36","out on Putney Common."
"x36",""
"x36","Here the scenery changed from the strange and unfamiliar to the"
"x36","wreckage of the familiar: patches of ground exhibited the devastation"
"x36","of a cyclone, and in a few score yards I would come upon perfectly"
"x36","undisturbed spaces, houses with their blinds trimly drawn and doors"
"x36","closed, as if they had been left for a day by the owners, or as if"
"x36","their inhabitants slept within.  The red weed was less abundant; the"
"x36","tall trees along the lane were free from the red creeper.  I hunted"
"x36","for food among the trees, finding nothing, and I also raided a couple"
"x36","of silent houses, but they had already been broken into and ransacked."
"x36","I rested for the remainder of the daylight in a shrubbery, being, in"
"x36","my enfeebled condition, too fatigued to push on."
"x36",""
"x36","All this time I saw no human beings, and no signs of the Martians."
"x36","I encountered a couple of hungry-looking dogs, but both hurried"
"x36","circuitously away from the advances I made them.  Near Roehampton I"
"x36","had seen two human skeletons--not bodies, but skeletons, picked"
"x36","clean--and in the wood by me I found the crushed and scattered bones"
"x36","of several cats and rabbits and the skull of a sheep.  But though I"
"x36","gnawed parts of these in my mouth, there was nothing to be got from"
"x36","them."
"x36",""
"x36","After sunset I struggled on along the road towards Putney, where I"
"x36","think the Heat-Ray must have been used for some reason.  And in the"
"x36","garden beyond Roehampton I got a quantity of immature potatoes,"
"x36","sufficient to stay my hunger.  From this garden one looked down upon"
"x36","Putney and the river.  The aspect of the place in the dusk was"
"x36","singularly desolate: blackened trees, blackened, desolate ruins, and"
"x36","down the hill the sheets of the flooded river, red-tinged with the"
"x36","weed.  And over all--silence.  It filled me with indescribable terror"
"x36","to think how swiftly that desolating change had come."
"x36",""
"x36","For a time I believed that mankind had been swept out of existence,"
"x36","and that I stood there alone, the last man left alive.  Hard by the"
"x36","top of Putney Hill I came upon another skeleton, with the arms"
"x36","dislocated and removed several yards from the rest of the body.  As I"
"x36","proceeded I became more and more convinced that the extermination of"
"x36","mankind was, save for such stragglers as myself, already accomplished"
"x36","in this part of the world.  The Martians, I thought, had gone on and"
"x36","left the country desolated, seeking food elsewhere.  Perhaps even now"
"x36","they were destroying Berlin or Paris, or it might be they had gone"
"x36","northward."

"x36","CHAPTER SEVEN"
"x36",""
"x36","THE MAN ON PUTNEY HILL"
"x36",""
"x36",""
"x36","I spent that night in the inn that stands at the top of Putney"
"x36","Hill, sleeping in a made bed for the first time since my flight to"
"x36","Leatherhead.  I will not tell the needless trouble I had breaking into"
"x36","that house--afterwards I found the front door was on the latch--nor"
"x36","how I ransacked every room for food, until just on the verge of"
"x36","despair, in what seemed to me to be a servant's bedroom, I found a"
"x36","rat-gnawed crust and two tins of pineapple.  The place had been"
"x36","already searched and emptied.  In the bar I afterwards found some"
"x36","biscuits and sandwiches that had been overlooked.  The latter I could"
"x36","not eat, they were too rotten, but the former not only stayed my"
"x36","hunger, but filled my pockets.  I lit no lamps, fearing some Martian"
"x36","might come beating that part of London for food in the night.  Before"
"x36","I went to bed I had an interval of restlessness, and prowled from"
"x36","window to window, peering out for some sign of these monsters.  I"
"x36","slept little.  As I lay in bed I found myself thinking consecutively--a"
"x36","thing I do not remember to have done since my last argument with the"
"x36","curate.  During all the intervening time my mental condition had been"
"x36","a hurrying succession of vague emotional states or a sort of stupid"
"x36","receptivity.  But in the night my brain, reinforced, I suppose, by the"
"x36","food I had eaten, grew clear again, and I thought."
"x36",""
"x36","Three things struggled for possession of my mind: the killing of"
"x36","the curate, the whereabouts of the Martians, and the possible fate of"
"x36","my wife.  The former gave me no sensation of horror or remorse to"
"x36","recall; I saw it simply as a thing done, a memory infinitely"
"x36","disagreeable but quite without the quality of remorse.  I saw myself"
"x36","then as I see myself now, driven step by step towards that hasty blow,"
"x36","the creature of a sequence of accidents leading inevitably to that.  I"
"x36","felt no condemnation; yet the memory, static, unprogressive, haunted"
"x36","me.  In the silence of the night, with that sense of the nearness of"
"x36","God that sometimes comes into the stillness and the darkness, I stood"
"x36","my trial, my only trial, for that moment of wrath and fear.  I"
"x36","retraced every step of our conversation from the moment when I had"
"x36","found him crouching beside me, heedless of my thirst, and pointing to"
"x36","the fire and smoke that streamed up from the ruins of Weybridge.  We"
"x36","had been incapable of co-operation--grim chance had taken no heed of"
"x36","that.  Had I foreseen, I should have left him at Halliford.  But I did"
"x36","not foresee; and crime is to foresee and do.  And I set this down as I"
"x36","have set all this story down, as it was.  There were no witnesses--all"
"x36","these things I might have concealed.  But I set it down, and the"
"x36","reader must form his judgment as he will."
"x36",""
"x36","And when, by an effort, I had set aside that picture of a prostrate"
"x36","body, I faced the problem of the Martians and the fate of my wife.  For"
"x36","the former I had no data; I could imagine a hundred things, and so,"
"x36","unhappily, I could for the latter.  And suddenly that night became"
"x36","terrible.  I found myself sitting up in bed, staring at the dark.  I"
"x36","found myself praying that the Heat-Ray might have suddenly and"
"x36","painlessly struck her out of being.  Since the night of my return from"
"x36","Leatherhead I had not prayed.  I had uttered prayers, fetish prayers,"
"x36","had prayed as heathens mutter charms when I was in extremity; but now"
"x36","I prayed indeed, pleading steadfastly and sanely, face to face with"
"x36","the darkness of God.  Strange night!  Strangest in this, that so soon"
"x36","as dawn had come, I, who had talked with God, crept out of the house"
"x36","like a rat leaving its hiding place--a creature scarcely larger, an"
"x36","inferior animal, a thing that for any passing whim of our masters"
"x36","might be hunted and killed.  Perhaps they also prayed confidently to"
"x36","God.  Surely, if we have learned nothing else, this war has taught us"
"x36","pity--pity for those witless souls that suffer our dominion."
"x36",""
"x36","The morning was bright and fine, and the eastern sky glowed pink,"
"x36","and was fretted with little golden clouds.  In the road that runs from"
"x36","the top of Putney Hill to Wimbledon was a number of poor vestiges of"
"x36","the panic torrent that must have poured Londonward on the Sunday night"
"x36","after the fighting began.  There was a little two-wheeled cart"
"x36","inscribed with the name of Thomas Lobb, Greengrocer, New Malden, with"
"x36","a smashed wheel and an abandoned tin trunk; there was a straw hat"
"x36","trampled into the now hardened mud, and at the top of West Hill a lot"
"x36","of blood-stained glass about the overturned water trough.  My"
"x36","movements were languid, my plans of the vaguest.  I had an idea of"
"x36","going to Leatherhead, though I knew that there I had the poorest"
"x36","chance of finding my wife.  Certainly, unless death had overtaken them"
"x36","suddenly, my cousins and she would have fled thence; but it seemed to"
"x36","me I might find or learn there whither the Surrey people had fled.  I"
"x36","knew I wanted to find my wife, that my heart ached for her and the"
"x36","world of men, but I had no clear idea how the finding might be done.  I"
"x36","was also sharply aware now of my intense loneliness.  From the corner"
"x36","I went, under cover of a thicket of trees and bushes, to the edge of"
"x36","Wimbledon Common, stretching wide and far."
"x36",""
"x36","That dark expanse was lit in patches by yellow gorse and broom;"
"x36","there was no red weed to be seen, and as I prowled, hesitating, on the"
"x36","verge of the open, the sun rose, flooding it all with light and"
"x36","vitality.  I came upon a busy swarm of little frogs in a swampy place"
"x36","among the trees.  I stopped to look at them, drawing a lesson from"
"x36","their stout resolve to live.  And presently, turning suddenly, with an"
"x36","odd feeling of being watched, I beheld something crouching amid a"
"x36","clump of bushes.  I stood regarding this.  I made a step towards it,"
"x36","and it rose up and became a man armed with a cutlass.  I approached"
"x36","him slowly.  He stood silent and motionless, regarding me."
"x36",""
"x36","As I drew nearer I perceived he was dressed in clothes as dusty and"
"x36","filthy as my own; he looked, indeed, as though he had been dragged"
"x36","through a culvert.  Nearer, I distinguished the green slime of ditches"
"x36","mixing with the pale drab of dried clay and shiny, coaly patches.  His"
"x36","black hair fell over his eyes, and his face was dark and dirty and"
"x36","sunken, so that at first I did not recognise him.  There was a red cut"
"x36","across the lower part of his face."
"x36",""
"x36","""Stop!"" he cried, when I was within ten yards of him, and I"
"x36","stopped.  His voice was hoarse.  ""Where do you come from?"" he said."
"x36",""
"x36","I thought, surveying him."
"x36",""
"x36","""I come from Mortlake,"" I said.  ""I was buried near the pit the"
"x36","Martians made about their cylinder.  I have worked my way out and"
"x36","escaped."""
"x36",""
"x36","""There is no food about here,"" he said.  ""This is my country.  All"
"x36","this hill down to the river, and back to Clapham, and up to the edge"
"x36","of the common.  There is only food for one.  Which way are you going?"""
"x36",""
"x36","I answered slowly."
"x36",""
"x36","""I don't know,"" I said.  ""I have been buried in the ruins of a"
"x36","house thirteen or fourteen days.  I don't know what has happened."""
"x36",""
"x36","He looked at me doubtfully, then started, and looked with a changed"
"x36","expression."
"x36",""
"x36","""I've no wish to stop about here,"" said I.  ""I think I shall go to"
"x36","Leatherhead, for my wife was there."""
"x36",""
"x36","He shot out a pointing finger."
"x36",""
"x36","""It is you,"" said he; ""the man from Woking.  And you weren't killed"
"x36","at Weybridge?"""
"x36",""
"x36","I recognised him at the same moment."
"x36",""
"x36","""You are the artilleryman who came into my garden."""
"x36",""
"x36","""Good luck!"" he said.  ""We are lucky ones!  Fancy _you_!""  He put out"
"x36","a hand, and I took it.  ""I crawled up a drain,"" he said. ""But they"
"x36","didn't kill everyone.  And after they went away I got off towards"
"x36","Walton across the fields.  But---- It's not sixteen days altogether--and"
"x36","your hair is grey.""  He looked over his shoulder suddenly.  ""Only"
"x36","a rook,"" he said.  ""One gets to know that birds have shadows these"
"x36","days.  This is a bit open.  Let us crawl under those bushes and talk."""
"x36",""
"x36","""Have you seen any Martians?"" I said.  ""Since I crawled out----"""
"x36",""
"x36","""They've gone away across London,"" he said.  ""I guess they've got a"
"x36","bigger camp there.  Of a night, all over there, Hampstead way, the sky"
"x36","is alive with their lights.  It's like a great city, and in the glare"
"x36","you can just see them moving.  By daylight you can't.  But nearer--I"
"x36","haven't seen them--"" (he counted on his fingers) ""five days.  Then I"
"x36","saw a couple across Hammersmith way carrying something big.  And the"
"x36","night before last""--he stopped and spoke impressively--""it was just a"
"x36","matter of lights, but it was something up in the air.  I believe"
"x36","they've built a flying-machine, and are learning to fly."""
"x36",""
"x36","I stopped, on hands and knees, for we had come to the bushes."
"x36",""
"x36","""Fly!"""
"x36",""
"x36","""Yes,"" he said, ""fly."""
"x36",""
"x36","I went on into a little bower, and sat down."
"x36",""
"x36","""It is all over with humanity,"" I said.  ""If they can do that they"
"x36","will simply go round the world."""
"x36",""
"x36","He nodded."
"x36",""
"x36","""They will.  But---- It will relieve things over here a bit.  And"
"x36","besides----""  He looked at me.  ""Aren't you satisfied it _is_ up with"
"x36","humanity?  I am.  We're down; we're beat."""
"x36",""
"x36","I stared.  Strange as it may seem, I had not arrived at this fact--a"
"x36","fact perfectly obvious so soon as he spoke.  I had still held a"
"x36","vague hope; rather, I had kept a lifelong habit of mind.  He repeated"
"x36","his words, ""We're beat.""  They carried absolute conviction."
"x36",""
"x36","""It's all over,"" he said.  ""They've lost _one_--just _one_.  And they've"
"x36","made their footing good and crippled the greatest power in the world."

"x36","accident.  And these are only pioneers.  They kept on coming.  These"
"x36","green stars--I've seen none these five or six days, but I've no doubt"
"x36","they're falling somewhere every night.  Nothing's to be done.  We're"
"x36","under! We're beat!"""
"x36",""
"x36","I made him no answer.  I sat staring before me, trying in vain to"
"x36","devise some countervailing thought."
"x36",""
"x36","""This isn't a war,"" said the artilleryman.  ""It never was a war,"
"x36","any more than there's war between man and ants."""
"x36",""
"x36","Suddenly I recalled the night in the observatory."

"x36","""After the tenth shot they fired no more--at least, until the first"

"x36","""How do you know?"" said the artilleryman.  I explained.  He thought."
"x36","""Something wrong with the gun,"" he said.  ""But what if there is?"
"x36","They'll get it right again.  And even if there's a delay, how can it"
"x36","alter the end?  It's just men and ants.  There's the ants builds their"
"x36","cities, live their lives, have wars, revolutions, until the men want"
"x36","them out of the way, and then they go out of the way.  That's what we"
"x36","are now--just ants.  Only----"""
"x36",""
"x36","""Yes,"" I said."
"x36",""
"x36","""We're eatable ants."""
"x36",""
"x36","We sat looking at each other."

"x36",""
"x36","""That's what I've been thinking,"" he said; ""that's what I've been"

"x36","Most of the people were hard at it squealing and exciting themselves."
"x36","But I'm not so fond of squealing.  I've been in sight of death once or"

"x36","death--it's just death.  And it's the man that keeps on thinking comes"
"x36","through.  I saw everyone tracking away south.  Says I, 'Food won't"

"x36","picking houses to pieces and routing among the wreckage.  But they"
"x36","won't keep on doing that.  So soon as they've settled all our guns and"
"x36","ships, and smashed our railways, and done all the things they are"
"x36","doing over there, they will begin catching us systematic, picking the"
"x36","best and storing us in cages and things.  That's what they will start"

"x36","that?"""
"x36",""
"x36","""Not begun!"" I exclaimed."
"x36",""
"x36","""Not begun.  All that's happened so far is through our not having"

"x36","more safety than where we were.  They don't want to bother us yet."
"x36","They're making their things--making all the things they couldn't bring"
"x36","with them, getting things ready for the rest of their people.  Very"
"x36","likely that's why the cylinders have stopped for a bit, for fear of"
"x36","hitting those who are here.  And instead of our rushing about blind,"
"x36","on the howl, or getting dynamite on the chance of busting them up,"
"x36","we've got to fix ourselves up according to the new state of affairs."
"x36","That's how I figure it out.  It isn't quite according to what a man"

"x36","the other--Lord!  What is he but funk and precautions?  They just used"
"x36","to skedaddle off to work--I've seen hundreds of 'em, bit of breakfast"
"x36","in hand, running wild and shining to catch their little season-ticket"
"x36","train, for fear they'd get dismissed if they didn't; working at"
"x36","businesses they were afraid to take the trouble to understand;"
"x36","skedaddling back for fear they wouldn't be in time for dinner; keeping"
"x36","indoors after dinner for fear of the back streets, and sleeping with"
"x36","the wives they married, not because they wanted them, but because they"
"x36","had a bit of money that would make for safety in their one little"
"x36","miserable skedaddle through the world.  Lives insured and a bit"
"x36","invested for fear of accidents.  And on Sundays--fear of the"
"x36","hereafter.  As if hell was built for rabbits!  Well, the Martians will"
"x36","just be a godsend to these.  Nice roomy cages, fattening food, careful"
"x36","breeding, no worry.  After a week or so chasing about the fields and"
"x36","lands on empty stomachs, they'll come and be caught cheerful.  They'll"
"x36","be quite glad after a bit.  They'll wonder what people did before"
"x36","there were Martians to take care of them.  And the bar loafers, and"
"x36","mashers, and singers--I can imagine them.  I can imagine them,"" he"
"x36","said, with a sort of sombre gratification.  ""There'll be any amount of"
"x36","sentiment and religion loose among them.  There's hundreds of things I"
"x36","saw with my eyes that I've only begun to see clearly these last few"
"x36","days.  There's lots will take things as they are--fat and stupid; and"
"x36","lots will be worried by a sort of feeling that it's all wrong, and"
"x36","that they ought to be doing something.  Now whenever things are so"
"x36","that a lot of people feel they ought to be doing something, the weak,"
"x36","and those who go weak with a lot of complicated thinking, always make"
"x36","for a sort of do-nothing religion, very pious and superior, and"
"x36","submit to persecution and the will of the Lord.  Very likely you've"
"x36","seen the same thing.  It's energy in a gale of funk, and turned clean"
"x36","inside out.  These cages will be full of psalms and hymns and piety."
"x36","And those of a less simple sort will work in a bit of--what is"
"x36","it?--eroticism."""
"x36",""
"x36","He paused."
"x36",""
"x36","""Very likely these Martians will make pets of some of them; train"
"x36","them to do tricks--who knows?--get sentimental over the pet boy who"
"x36","grew up and had to be killed.  And some, maybe, they will train to"
"x36","hunt us."""
"x36",""
"x36","""No,"" I cried, ""that's impossible!  No human being----"""
"x36",""
"x36","""What's the good of going on with such lies?"" said the"

"x36",""
"x36","And I succumbed to his conviction."
"x36",""
"x36","""If they come after me,"" he said; ""Lord, if they come after me!"""
"x36","and subsided into a grim meditation."
"x36",""
"x36","I sat contemplating these things.  I could find nothing to bring"
"x36","against this man's reasoning.  In the days before the invasion no one"
"x36","would have questioned my intellectual superiority to his--I, a"
"x36","professed and recognised writer on philosophical themes, and he, a"
"x36","common soldier; and yet he had already formulated a situation that I"
"x36","had scarcely realised."
"x36",""
"x36","""What are you doing?"" I said presently.  ""What plans have you"
"x36","made?"""
"x36",""
"x36","He hesitated."
"x36",""
"x36","""Well, it's like this,"" he said.  ""What have we to do?  We have to"
"x36","invent a sort of life where men can live and breed, and be"
"x36","sufficiently secure to bring the children up.  Yes--wait a bit, and"
"x36","I'll make it clearer what I think ought to be done.  The tame ones"
"x36","will go like all tame beasts; in a few generations they'll be big,"
"x36","beautiful, rich-blooded, stupid--rubbish! The risk is that we who keep"
"x36","wild will go savage--degenerate into a sort of big, savage rat. . . ."
"x36","You see, how I mean to live is underground.  I've been thinking about"
"x36","the drains.  Of course those who don't know drains think horrible"
"x36","things; but under this London are miles and miles--hundreds of"
"x36","miles--and a few days rain and London empty will leave them sweet and"
"x36","clean. The main drains are big enough and airy enough for anyone."
"x36","Then there's cellars, vaults, stores, from which bolting passages may"
"x36","be made to the drains. And the railway tunnels and subways.  Eh?  You"
"x36","begin to see?  And we form a band--able-bodied, clean-minded men."
"x36","We're not going to pick up any rubbish that drifts in.  Weaklings"
"x36","go out again."""
"x36",""
"x36","""As you meant me to go?"""
"x36",""
"x36","""Well--I parleyed, didn't I?"""
"x36",""
"x36","""We won't quarrel about that.  Go on."""
"x36",""
"x36","""Those who stop obey orders.  Able-bodied, clean-minded women we"
"x36","want also--mothers and teachers.  No lackadaisical ladies--no blasted"

"x36","and the useless and cumbersome and mischievous have to die.  They"
"x36","ought to die.  They ought to be willing to die.  It's a sort of"
"x36","disloyalty, after all, to live and taint the race.  And they can't be"
"x36","happy.  Moreover, dying's none so dreadful; it's the funking makes it"
"x36","bad.  And in all those places we shall gather.  Our district will be"
"x36","London.  And we may even be able to keep a watch, and run about in the"
"x36","open when the Martians keep away.  Play cricket, perhaps.  That's how"
"x36","we shall save the race.  Eh?  It's a possible thing?  But saving the"
"x36","race is nothing in itself.  As I say, that's only being rats.  It's"
"x36","saving our knowledge and adding to it is the thing.  There men like"
"x36","you come in.  There's books, there's models.  We must make great safe"
"x36","places down deep, and get all the books we can; not novels and poetry"
"x36","swipes, but ideas, science books.  That's where men like you come in."
"x36","We must go to the British Museum and pick all those books through."
"x36","Especially we must keep up our science--learn more.  We must watch"
"x36","these Martians.  Some of us must go as spies.  When it's all working,"
"x36","perhaps I will.  Get caught, I mean.  And the great thing is, we must"
"x36","leave the Martians alone.  We mustn't even steal.  If we get in their"
"x36","way, we clear out.  We must show them we mean no harm.  Yes, I know."
"x36","But they're intelligent things, and they won't hunt us down if they"
"x36","have all they want, and think we're just harmless vermin."""
"x36",""
"x36","The artilleryman paused and laid a brown hand upon my arm."
"x36",""
"x36","""After all, it may not be so much we may have to learn before--Just"
"x36","imagine this: four or five of their fighting machines suddenly"
"x36","starting off--Heat-Rays right and left, and not a Martian in 'em.  Not"
"x36","a Martian in 'em, but men--men who have learned the way how.  It may"
"x36","be in my time, even--those men.  Fancy having one of them lovely"
"x36","things, with its Heat-Ray wide and free!  Fancy having it in control!"
"x36","What would it matter if you smashed to smithereens at the end of the"
"x36","run, after a bust like that?  I reckon the Martians'll open their"
"x36","beautiful eyes!  Can't you see them, man?  Can't you see them"
"x36","hurrying, hurrying--puffing and blowing and hooting to their other"
"x36","mechanical affairs?  Something out of gear in every case.  And swish,"
"x36","bang, rattle, swish!  Just as they are fumbling over it, _swish_ comes"

"x36",""
"x36","For a while the imaginative daring of the artilleryman, and the"
"x36","tone of assurance and courage he assumed, completely dominated my"
"x36","mind.  I believed unhesitatingly both in his forecast of human destiny"
"x36","and in the practicability of his astonishing scheme, and the reader"
"x36","who thinks me susceptible and foolish must contrast his position,"
"x36","reading steadily with all his thoughts about his subject, and mine,"
"x36","crouching fearfully in the bushes and listening, distracted by"
"x36","apprehension.  We talked in this manner through the early morning"
"x36","time, and later crept out of the bushes, and, after scanning the sky"
"x36","for Martians, hurried precipitately to the house on Putney Hill where"
"x36","he had made his lair.  It was the coal cellar of the place, and when I"
"x36","saw the work he had spent a week upon--it was a burrow scarcely ten"
"x36","yards long, which he designed to reach to the main drain on Putney"
"x36","Hill--I had my first inkling of the gulf between his dreams and his"
"x36","powers.  Such a hole I could have dug in a day.  But I believed in him"
"x36","sufficiently to work with him all that morning until past midday at"
"x36","his digging.  We had a garden barrow and shot the earth we removed"
"x36","against the kitchen range.  We refreshed ourselves with a tin of"
"x36","mock-turtle soup and wine from the neighbouring pantry.  I found a"
"x36","curious relief from the aching strangeness of the world in this steady"
"x36","labour. As we worked, I turned his project over in my mind, and"
"x36","presently objections and doubts began to arise; but I worked there all"
"x36","the morning, so glad was I to find myself with a purpose again.  After"
"x36","working an hour I began to speculate on the distance one had to go"
"x36","before the cloaca was reached, the chances we had of missing it"
"x36","altogether.  My immediate trouble was why we should dig this long"
"x36","tunnel, when it was possible to get into the drain at once down one of"
"x36","the manholes, and work back to the house.  It seemed to me, too, that"
"x36","the house was inconveniently chosen, and required a needless length of"
"x36","tunnel.  And just as I was beginning to face these things, the"
"x36","artilleryman stopped digging, and looked at me."
"x36",""
"x36","""We're working well,"" he said.  He put down his spade. ""Let us"
"x36","knock off a bit"" he said.  ""I think it's time we reconnoitred from the"
"x36","roof of the house."""
"x36",""
"x36","I was for going on, and after a little hesitation he resumed his"
"x36","spade; and then suddenly I was struck by a thought.  I stopped, and so"
"x36","did he at once."
"x36",""
"x36","""Why were you walking about the common,"" I said, ""instead of being"
"x36","here?"""
"x36",""
"x36","""Taking the air,"" he said.  ""I was coming back.  It's safer by"
"x36","night."""
"x36",""
"x36","""But the work?"""
"x36",""
"x36","""Oh, one can't always work,"" he said, and in a flash I saw the man"
"x36","plain.  He hesitated, holding his spade.  ""We ought to reconnoitre"
"x36","now,"" he said, ""because if any come near they may hear the spades and"
"x36","drop upon us unawares."""
"x36",""
"x36","I was no longer disposed to object.  We went together to the roof"
"x36","and stood on a ladder peeping out of the roof door.  No Martians were"
"x36","to be seen, and we ventured out on the tiles, and slipped down under"
"x36","shelter of the parapet."
"x36",""
"x36","From this position a shrubbery hid the greater portion of Putney,"
"x36","but we could see the river below, a bubbly mass of red weed, and the"
"x36","low parts of Lambeth flooded and red.  The red creeper swarmed up the"
"x36","trees about the old palace, and their branches stretched gaunt and"
"x36","dead, and set with shrivelled leaves, from amid its clusters.  It was"
"x36","strange how entirely dependent both these things were upon flowing"
"x36","water for their propagation.  About us neither had gained a footing;"
"x36","laburnums, pink mays, snowballs, and trees of arbor-vitae, rose out of"
"x36","laurels and hydrangeas, green and brilliant into the sunlight.  Beyond"
"x36","Kensington dense smoke was rising, and that and a blue haze hid the"
"x36","northward hills."
"x36",""
"x36","The artilleryman began to tell me of the sort of people who still"
"x36","remained in London."
"x36",""
"x36","""One night last week,"" he said, ""some fools got the electric light"
"x36","in order, and there was all Regent Street and the Circus ablaze,"
"x36","crowded with painted and ragged drunkards, men and women, dancing and"
"x36","shouting till dawn.  A man who was there told me.  And as the day came"
"x36","they became aware of a fighting-machine standing near by the Langham"
"x36","and looking down at them.  Heaven knows how long he had been there."
"x36","It must have given some of them a nasty turn.  He came down the road"
"x36","towards them, and picked up nearly a hundred too drunk or frightened"
"x36","to run away."""
"x36",""
"x36","Grotesque gleam of a time no history will ever fully describe!"
"x36",""
"x36","From that, in answer to my questions, he came round to his"
"x36","grandiose plans again.  He grew enthusiastic.  He talked so eloquently"
"x36","of the possibility of capturing a fighting-machine that I more than"
"x36","half believed in him again.  But now that I was beginning to"
"x36","understand something of his quality, I could divine the stress he laid"
"x36","on doing nothing precipitately.  And I noted that now there was no"
"x36","question that he personally was to capture and fight the great"
"x36","machine."
"x36",""
"x36","After a time we went down to the cellar.  Neither of us seemed"
"x36","disposed to resume digging, and when he suggested a meal, I was"
"x36","nothing loath.  He became suddenly very generous, and when we had"
"x36","eaten he went away and returned with some excellent cigars.  We lit"
"x36","these, and his optimism glowed.  He was inclined to regard my coming"
"x36","as a great occasion."
"x36",""
"x36","""There's some champagne in the cellar,"" he said."
"x36",""
"x36","""We can dig better on this Thames-side burgundy,"" said I."
"x36",""
"x36","""No,"" said he; ""I am host today.  Champagne!  Great God! We've a"
"x36","heavy enough task before us!  Let us take a rest and gather strength"
"x36","while we may.  Look at these blistered hands!"""
"x36",""
"x36","And pursuant to this idea of a holiday, he insisted upon playing"
"x36","cards after we had eaten.  He taught me euchre, and after dividing"
"x36","London between us, I taking the northern side and he the southern, we"
"x36","played for parish points.  Grotesque and foolish as this will seem to"
"x36","the sober reader, it is absolutely true, and what is more remarkable,"
"x36","I found the card game and several others we played extremely"
"x36","interesting."
"x36",""
"x36","Strange mind of man! that, with our species upon the edge of"
"x36","extermination or appalling degradation, with no clear prospect before"
"x36","us but the chance of a horrible death, we could sit following the"
"x36","chance of this painted pasteboard, and playing the ""joker"" with vivid"
"x36","delight.  Afterwards he taught me poker, and I beat him at three tough"
"x36","chess games.  When dark came we decided to take the risk, and lit a"
"x36","lamp."
"x36",""
"x36","After an interminable string of games, we supped, and the"
"x36","artilleryman finished the champagne.  We went on smoking the cigars."
"x36","He was no longer the energetic regenerator of his species I had"
"x36","encountered in the morning.  He was still optimistic, but it was a"
"x36","less kinetic, a more thoughtful optimism.  I remember he wound up with"
"x36","my health, proposed in a speech of small variety and considerable"
"x36","intermittence.  I took a cigar, and went upstairs to look at the"
"x36","lights of which he had spoken that blazed so greenly along the"
"x36","Highgate hills."
"x36",""
"x36","At first I stared unintelligently across the London valley.  The"
"x36","northern hills were shrouded in darkness; the fires near Kensington"
"x36","glowed redly, and now and then an orange-red tongue of flame flashed"
"x36","up and vanished in the deep blue night.  All the rest of London"
"x36","was black.  Then, nearer, I perceived a strange light, a pale,"
"x36","violet-purple fluorescent glow, quivering under the night breeze.  For"
"x36","a space I could not understand it, and then I knew that it must be"
"x36","the red weed from which this faint irradiation proceeded.  With that"
"x36","realisation my dormant sense of wonder, my sense of the proportion of"
"x36","things, awoke again.  I glanced from that to Mars, red and clear,"
"x36","glowing high in the west, and then gazed long and earnestly at the"
"x36","darkness of Hampstead and Highgate."
"x36",""
"x36","I remained a very long time upon the roof, wondering at the"
"x36","grotesque changes of the day.  I recalled my mental states from the"
"x36","midnight prayer to the foolish card-playing.  I had a violent"
"x36","revulsion of feeling.  I remember I flung away the cigar with a"
"x36","certain wasteful symbolism.  My folly came to me with glaring"
"x36","exaggeration.  I seemed a traitor to my wife and to my kind; I was"
"x36","filled with remorse.  I resolved to leave this strange undisciplined"
"x36","dreamer of great things to his drink and gluttony, and to go on into"
"x36","London.  There, it seemed to me, I had the best chance of learning"
"x36","what the Martians and my fellowmen were doing.  I was still upon the"
"x36","roof when the late moon rose."

"x36","CHAPTER EIGHT"
"x36",""
"x36","DEAD LONDON"
"x36",""
"x36",""
"x36","After I had parted from the artilleryman, I went down the hill, and"
"x36","by the High Street across the bridge to Fulham.  The red weed was"
"x36","tumultuous at that time, and nearly choked the bridge roadway; but its"
"x36","fronds were already whitened in patches by the spreading disease that"
"x36","presently removed it so swiftly."
"x36",""
"x36","At the corner of the lane that runs to Putney Bridge station I"
"x36","found a man lying.  He was as black as a sweep with the black dust,"
"x36","alive, but helplessly and speechlessly drunk.  I could get nothing"
"x36","from him but curses and furious lunges at my head.  I think I should"
"x36","have stayed by him but for the brutal expression of his face."
"x36",""
"x36","There was black dust along the roadway from the bridge onwards, and"
"x36","it grew thicker in Fulham.  The streets were horribly quiet.  I got"
"x36","food--sour, hard, and mouldy, but quite eatable--in a baker's shop"
"x36","here.  Some way towards Walham Green the streets became clear of"
"x36","powder, and I passed a white terrace of houses on fire; the noise of"
"x36","the burning was an absolute relief.  Going on towards Brompton, the"
"x36","streets were quiet again."
"x36",""
"x36","Here I came once more upon the black powder in the streets and upon"
"x36","dead bodies.  I saw altogether about a dozen in the length of the"
"x36","Fulham Road.  They had been dead many days, so that I hurried quickly"
"x36","past them.  The black powder covered them over, and softened their"
"x36","outlines.  One or two had been disturbed by dogs."
"x36",""
"x36","Where there was no black powder, it was curiously like a Sunday in"
"x36","the City, with the closed shops, the houses locked up and the blinds"
"x36","drawn, the desertion, and the stillness.  In some places plunderers"
"x36","had been at work, but rarely at other than the provision and wine"
"x36","shops.  A jeweller's window had been broken open in one place, but"
"x36","apparently the thief had been disturbed, and a number of gold chains"
"x36","and a watch lay scattered on the pavement.  I did not trouble to touch"
"x36","them.  Farther on was a tattered woman in a heap on a doorstep; the"
"x36","hand that hung over her knee was gashed and bled down her rusty brown"
"x36","dress, and a smashed magnum of champagne formed a pool across the"
"x36","pavement.  She seemed asleep, but she was dead."
"x36",""
"x36","The farther I penetrated into London, the profounder grew the"
"x36","stillness.  But it was not so much the stillness of death--it was the"
"x36","stillness of suspense, of expectation.  At any time the destruction"
"x36","that had already singed the northwestern borders of the metropolis,"
"x36","and had annihilated Ealing and Kilburn, might strike among these"
"x36","houses and leave them smoking ruins.  It was a city condemned and"
"x36","derelict. . . ."
"x36",""
"x36","In South Kensington the streets were clear of dead and of black"
"x36","powder.  It was near South Kensington that I first heard the howling."
"x36","It crept almost imperceptibly upon my senses.  It was a sobbing"
"x36","alternation of two notes, ""Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,"" keeping on"
"x36","perpetually.  When I passed streets that ran northward it grew in"
"x36","volume, and houses and buildings seemed to deaden and cut it off"
"x36","again.  It came in a full tide down Exhibition Road.  I stopped,"
"x36","staring towards Kensington Gardens, wondering at this strange, remote"
"x36","wailing.  It was as if that mighty desert of houses had found a voice"
"x36","for its fear and solitude."
"x36",""
"x36","""Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,"" wailed that superhuman note--great waves"
"x36","of sound sweeping down the broad, sunlit roadway, between the tall"
"x36","buildings on each side.  I turned northwards, marvelling, towards the"
"x36","iron gates of Hyde Park.  I had half a mind to break into the Natural"
"x36","History Museum and find my way up to the summits of the towers, in"
"x36","order to see across the park.  But I decided to keep to the ground,"
"x36","where quick hiding was possible, and so went on up the Exhibition"
"x36","Road.  All the large mansions on each side of the road were empty and"
"x36","still, and my footsteps echoed against the sides of the houses.  At"
"x36","the top, near the park gate, I came upon a strange sight--a bus"
"x36","overturned, and the skeleton of a horse picked clean.  I puzzled over"
"x36","this for a time, and then went on to the bridge over the Serpentine."
"x36","The voice grew stronger and stronger, though I could see nothing above"
"x36","the housetops on the north side of the park, save a haze of smoke to"
"x36","the northwest."
"x36",""
"x36","""Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,"" cried the voice, coming, as it seemed to"
"x36","me, from the district about Regent's Park.  The desolating cry worked"
"x36","upon my mind.  The mood that had sustained me passed.  The wailing"
"x36","took possession of me.  I found I was intensely weary, footsore, and"
"x36","now again hungry and thirsty."
"x36",""
"x36","It was already past noon.  Why was I wandering alone in this city"
"x36","of the dead?  Why was I alone when all London was lying in state, and"
"x36","in its black shroud?  I felt intolerably lonely.  My mind ran on old"
"x36","friends that I had forgotten for years.  I thought of the poisons in"
"x36","the chemists' shops, of the liquors the wine merchants stored; I"
"x36","recalled the two sodden creatures of despair, who so far as I knew,"
"x36","shared the city with myself. . . ."
"x36",""
"x36","I came into Oxford Street by the Marble Arch, and here again were"
"x36","black powder and several bodies, and an evil, ominous smell from the"
"x36","gratings of the cellars of some of the houses.  I grew very thirsty"
"x36","after the heat of my long walk.  With infinite trouble I managed to"
"x36","break into a public-house and get food and drink.  I was weary after"
"x36","eating, and went into the parlour behind the bar, and slept on a black"
"x36","horsehair sofa I found there."
"x36",""
"x36","I awoke to find that dismal howling still in my ears, ""Ulla, ulla,"
"x36","ulla, ulla.""  It was now dusk, and after I had routed out some"
"x36","biscuits and a cheese in the bar--there was a meat safe, but it"
"x36","contained nothing but maggots--I wandered on through the silent"
"x36","residential squares to Baker Street--Portman Square is the only one I"
"x36","can name--and so came out at last upon Regent's Park.  And as I"
"x36","emerged from the top of Baker Street, I saw far away over the trees in"
"x36","the clearness of the sunset the hood of the Martian giant from which"
"x36","this howling proceeded.  I was not terrified.  I came upon him as if"
"x36","it were a matter of course.  I watched him for some time, but he did"
"x36","not move.  He appeared to be standing and yelling, for no reason that"
"x36","I could discover."
"x36",""
"x36","I tried to formulate a plan of action.  That perpetual sound of"
"x36","""Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,"" confused my mind.  Perhaps I was too tired"
"x36","to be very fearful.  Certainly I was more curious to know the reason"
"x36","of this monotonous crying than afraid.  I turned back away from the"
"x36","park and struck into Park Road, intending to skirt the park, went"
"x36","along under the shelter of the terraces, and got a view of this"
"x36","stationary, howling Martian from the direction of St. John's Wood.  A"
"x36","couple of hundred yards out of Baker Street I heard a yelping chorus,"
"x36","and saw, first a dog with a piece of putrescent red meat in his jaws"
"x36","coming headlong towards me, and then a pack of starving mongrels in"
"x36","pursuit of him.  He made a wide curve to avoid me, as though he feared"
"x36","I might prove a fresh competitor.  As the yelping died away down the"
"x36","silent road, the wailing sound of ""Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,"" reasserted"
"x36","itself."
"x36",""
"x36","I came upon the wrecked handling-machine halfway to St. John's Wood"
"x36","station.  At first I thought a house had fallen across the road.  It"
"x36","was only as I clambered among the ruins that I saw, with a start, this"
"x36","mechanical Samson lying, with its tentacles bent and smashed and"
"x36","twisted, among the ruins it had made.  The forepart was shattered.  It"
"x36","seemed as if it had driven blindly straight at the house, and had been"
"x36","overwhelmed in its overthrow.  It seemed to me then that this might"
"x36","have happened by a handling-machine escaping from the guidance of its"
"x36","Martian.  I could not clamber among the ruins to see it, and the"
"x36","twilight was now so far advanced that the blood with which its seat"
"x36","was smeared, and the gnawed gristle of the Martian that the dogs had"
"x36","left, were invisible to me."
"x36",""
"x36","Wondering still more at all that I had seen, I pushed on towards"
"x36","Primrose Hill.  Far away, through a gap in the trees, I saw a second"
"x36","Martian, as motionless as the first, standing in the park towards the"
"x36","Zoological Gardens, and silent.  A little beyond the ruins about the"
"x36","smashed handling-machine I came upon the red weed again, and found the"
"x36","Regent's Canal, a spongy mass of dark-red vegetation."
"x36",""
"x36","As I crossed the bridge, the sound of ""Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,"""
"x36","ceased.  It was, as it were, cut off.  The silence came like a"
"x36","thunderclap."
"x36",""
"x36","The dusky houses about me stood faint and tall and dim; the trees"
"x36","towards the park were growing black.  All about me the red weed"
"x36","clambered among the ruins, writhing to get above me in the dimness."
"x36","Night, the mother of fear and mystery, was coming upon me.  But while"
"x36","that voice sounded the solitude, the desolation, had been endurable;"
"x36","by virtue of it London had still seemed alive, and the sense of life"
"x36","about me had upheld me.  Then suddenly a change, the passing of"
"x36","something--I knew not what--and then a stillness that could be felt."
"x36","Nothing but this gaunt quiet."
"x36",""
"x36","London about me gazed at me spectrally.  The windows in the white"
"x36","houses were like the eye sockets of skulls.  About me my imagination"
"x36","found a thousand noiseless enemies moving.  Terror seized me, a horror"
"x36","of my temerity.  In front of me the road became pitchy black as though"
"x36","it was tarred, and I saw a contorted shape lying across the pathway.  I"
"x36","could not bring myself to go on.  I turned down St. John's Wood Road,"
"x36","and ran headlong from this unendurable stillness towards Kilburn.  I"
"x36","hid from the night and the silence, until long after midnight, in a"
"x36","cabmen's shelter in Harrow Road.  But before the dawn my courage"
"x36","returned, and while the stars were still in the sky I turned once more"
"x36","towards Regent's Park.  I missed my way among the streets, and"
"x36","presently saw down a long avenue, in the half-light of the early dawn,"
"x36","the curve of Primrose Hill.  On the summit, towering up to the fading"
"x36","stars, was a third Martian, erect and motionless like the others."
"x36",""
"x36","An insane resolve possessed me.  I would die and end it.  And I"
"x36","would save myself even the trouble of killing myself.  I marched on"
"x36","recklessly towards this Titan, and then, as I drew nearer and the"
"x36","light grew, I saw that a multitude of black birds was circling and"
"x36","clustering about the hood.  At that my heart gave a bound, and I began"
"x36","running along the road."
"x36",""
"x36","I hurried through the red weed that choked St. Edmund's Terrace (I"
"x36","waded breast-high across a torrent of water that was rushing down from"
"x36","the waterworks towards the Albert Road), and emerged upon the grass"
"x36","before the rising of the sun.  Great mounds had been heaped about the"
"x36","crest of the hill, making a huge redoubt of it--it was the final and"
"x36","largest place the Martians had made--and from behind these heaps there"
"x36","rose a thin smoke against the sky.  Against the sky line an eager dog"
"x36","ran and disappeared.  The thought that had flashed into my mind grew"
"x36","real, grew credible.  I felt no fear, only a wild, trembling"
"x36","exultation, as I ran up the hill towards the motionless monster.  Out"
"x36","of the hood hung lank shreds of brown, at which the hungry birds"
"x36","pecked and tore."
"x36",""
"x36","In another moment I had scrambled up the earthen rampart and stood"
"x36","upon its crest, and the interior of the redoubt was below me.  A"
"x36","mighty space it was, with gigantic machines here and there within it,"
"x36","huge mounds of material and strange shelter places.  And scattered"
"x36","about it, some in their overturned war-machines, some in the now rigid"
"x36","handling-machines, and a dozen of them stark and silent and laid in a"
"x36","row, were the Martians--_dead_!--slain by the putrefactive and disease"
"x36","bacteria against which their systems were unprepared; slain as the red"
"x36","weed was being slain; slain, after all man's devices had failed, by"
"x36","the humblest things that God, in his wisdom, has put upon this earth."
"x36",""
"x36","For so it had come about, as indeed I and many men might have"
"x36","foreseen had not terror and disaster blinded our minds.  These"
"x36","germs of disease have taken toll of humanity since the beginning of"
"x36","things--taken toll of our prehuman ancestors since life began here."
"x36","But by virtue of this natural selection of our kind we have developed"
"x36","resisting power; to no germs do we succumb without a struggle, and to"
"x36","many--those that cause putrefaction in dead matter, for instance--our"
"x36","living frames are altogether immune.  But there are no bacteria in"
"x36","Mars, and directly these invaders arrived, directly they drank and"
"x36","fed, our microscopic allies began to work their overthrow.  Already"
"x36","when I watched them they were irrevocably doomed, dying and rotting"
"x36","even as they went to and fro.  It was inevitable.  By the toll of a"
"x36","billion deaths man has bought his birthright of the earth, and it is"
"x36","his against all comers; it would still be his were the Martians ten"
"x36","times as mighty as they are.  For neither do men live nor die in vain."
"x36",""
"x36","Here and there they were scattered, nearly fifty altogether, in"
"x36","that great gulf they had made, overtaken by a death that must have"
"x36","seemed to them as incomprehensible as any death could be.  To me also"
"x36","at that time this death was incomprehensible.  All I knew was that"
"x36","these things that had been alive and so terrible to men were dead."
"x36","For a moment I believed that the destruction of Sennacherib had been"
"x36","repeated, that God had repented, that the Angel of Death had slain"
"x36","them in the night."
"x36",""
"x36","I stood staring into the pit, and my heart lightened gloriously,"
"x36","even as the rising sun struck the world to fire about me with his"
"x36","rays.  The pit was still in darkness; the mighty engines, so great and"
"x36","wonderful in their power and complexity, so unearthly in their"
"x36","tortuous forms, rose weird and vague and strange out of the shadows"
"x36","towards the light.  A multitude of dogs, I could hear, fought over the"
"x36","bodies that lay darkly in the depth of the pit, far below me.  Across"
"x36","the pit on its farther lip, flat and vast and strange, lay the great"
"x36","flying-machine with which they had been experimenting upon our denser"
"x36","atmosphere when decay and death arrested them.  Death had come not a"
"x36","day too soon.  At the sound of a cawing overhead I looked up at the"
"x36","huge fighting-machine that would fight no more for ever, at the"
"x36","tattered red shreds of flesh that dripped down upon the overturned"
"x36","seats on the summit of Primrose Hill."
"x36",""
"x36","I turned and looked down the slope of the hill to where, enhaloed"
"x36","now in birds, stood those other two Martians that I had seen"
"x36","overnight, just as death had overtaken them.  The one had died, even"
"x36","as it had been crying to its companions; perhaps it was the last to"
"x36","die, and its voice had gone on perpetually until the force of its"
"x36","machinery was exhausted.  They glittered now, harmless tripod towers"
"x36","of shining metal, in the brightness of the rising sun."
"x36",""
"x36","All about the pit, and saved as by a miracle from everlasting"
"x36","destruction, stretched the great Mother of Cities.  Those who have only"
"x36","seen London veiled in her sombre robes of smoke can scarcely imagine"
"x36","the naked clearness and beauty of the silent wilderness of houses."
"x36",""
"x36","Eastward, over the blackened ruins of the Albert Terrace and the"
"x36","splintered spire of the church, the sun blazed dazzling in a clear"
"x36","sky, and here and there some facet in the great wilderness of roofs"
"x36","caught the light and glared with a white intensity."
"x36",""
"x36","Northward were Kilburn and Hampsted, blue and crowded with houses;"
"x36","westward the great city was dimmed; and southward, beyond the"
"x36","Martians, the green waves of Regent's Park, the Langham Hotel, the"
"x36","dome of the Albert Hall, the Imperial Institute, and the giant"
"x36","mansions of the Brompton Road came out clear and little in the"
"x36","sunrise, the jagged ruins of Westminster rising hazily beyond.  Far"
"x36","away and blue were the Surrey hills, and the towers of the Crystal"
"x36","Palace glittered like two silver rods.  The dome of St. Paul's was"
"x36","dark against the sunrise, and injured, I saw for the first time, by a"
"x36","huge gaping cavity on its western side."
"x36",""
"x36","And as I looked at this wide expanse of houses and factories and"
"x36","churches, silent and abandoned; as I thought of the multitudinous"
"x36","hopes and efforts, the innumerable hosts of lives that had gone to"
"x36","build this human reef, and of the swift and ruthless destruction that"
"x36","had hung over it all; when I realised that the shadow had been rolled"
"x36","back, and that men might still live in the streets, and this dear vast"
"x36","dead city of mine be once more alive and powerful, I felt a wave of"
"x36","emotion that was near akin to tears."
"x36",""
"x36","The torment was over.  Even that day the healing would begin.  The"
"x36","survivors of the people scattered over the country--leaderless,"
"x36","lawless, foodless, like sheep without a shepherd--the thousands who"
"x36","had fled by sea, would begin to return; the pulse of life, growing"
"x36","stronger and stronger, would beat again in the empty streets and pour"
"x36","across the vacant squares.  Whatever destruction was done, the hand of"
"x36","the destroyer was stayed.  All the gaunt wrecks, the blackened"
"x36","skeletons of houses that stared so dismally at the sunlit grass of the"
"x36","hill, would presently be echoing with the hammers of the restorers and"
"x36","ringing with the tapping of their trowels.  At the thought I extended"
"x36","my hands towards the sky and began thanking God.  In a year, thought"
"x36","I--in a year. . ."
"x36",""
"x36","With overwhelming force came the thought of myself, of my wife, and"
"x36","the old life of hope and tender helpfulness that had ceased for ever."

"x36","WRECKAGE"
"x36",""
"x36",""
"x36","And now comes the strangest thing in my story.  Yet, perhaps, it is"
"x36","not altogether strange.  I remember, clearly and coldly and vividly,"
"x36","all that I did that day until the time that I stood weeping and"
"x36","praising God upon the summit of Primrose Hill.  And then I forget."
"x36",""
"x36","Of the next three days I know nothing.  I have learned since that,"
"x36","so far from my being the first discoverer of the Martian overthrow,"
"x36","several such wanderers as myself had already discovered this on the"
"x36","previous night.  One man--the first--had gone to St. Martin's-le-Grand,"
"x36","and, while I sheltered in the cabmen's hut, had contrived to"
"x36","telegraph to Paris.  Thence the joyful news had flashed all over the"
"x36","world; a thousand cities, chilled by ghastly apprehensions, suddenly"
"x36","flashed into frantic illuminations; they knew of it in Dublin,"
"x36","Edinburgh, Manchester, Birmingham, at the time when I stood upon the"
"x36","verge of the pit.  Already men, weeping with joy, as I have heard,"
"x36","shouting and staying their work to shake hands and shout, were making"
"x36","up trains, even as near as Crewe, to descend upon London.  The church"
"x36","bells that had ceased a fortnight since suddenly caught the news,"
"x36","until all England was bell-ringing.  Men on cycles, lean-faced,"
"x36","unkempt, scorched along every country lane shouting of unhoped"
"x36","deliverance, shouting to gaunt, staring figures of despair.  And for"
"x36","the food!  Across the Channel, across the Irish Sea, across the"
"x36","Atlantic, corn, bread, and meat were tearing to our relief.  All the"
"x36","shipping in the world seemed going Londonward in those days.  But of"
"x36","all this I have no memory.  I drifted--a demented man.  I found myself"
"x36","in a house of kindly people, who had found me on the third day"
"x36","wandering, weeping, and raving through the streets of St. John's Wood."
"x36","They have told me since that I was singing some insane doggerel about"
"x36","""The Last Man Left Alive! Hurrah!  The Last Man Left Alive!""  Troubled"
"x36","as they were with their own affairs, these people, whose name, much as"
"x36","I would like to express my gratitude to them, I may not even give"
"x36","here, nevertheless cumbered themselves with me, sheltered me, and"
"x36","protected me from myself.  Apparently they had learned something of my"
"x36","story from me during the days of my lapse."
"x36",""
"x36","Very gently, when my mind was assured again, did they break to me"
"x36","what they had learned of the fate of Leatherhead.  Two days after I"
"x36","was imprisoned it had been destroyed, with every soul in it, by a"
"x36","Martian.  He had swept it out of existence, as it seemed, without any"
"x36","provocation, as a boy might crush an ant hill, in the mere wantonness"
"x36","of power."
"x36",""
"x36","I was a lonely man, and they were very kind to me.  I was a lonely"
"x36","man and a sad one, and they bore with me.  I remained with them four"
"x36","days after my recovery.  All that time I felt a vague, a growing"
"x36","craving to look once more on whatever remained of the little life that"
"x36","seemed so happy and bright in my past.  It was a mere hopeless desire"
"x36","to feast upon my misery.  They dissuaded me.  They did all they could"
"x36","to divert me from this morbidity.  But at last I could resist the"
"x36","impulse no longer, and, promising faithfully to return to them, and"
"x36","parting, as I will confess, from these four-day friends with tears, I"
"x36","went out again into the streets that had lately been so dark and"
"x36","strange and empty."
"x36",""
"x36","Already they were busy with returning people; in places even there"
"x36","were shops open, and I saw a drinking fountain running water."
"x36",""
"x36","I remember how mockingly bright the day seemed as I went back on my"
"x36","melancholy pilgrimage to the little house at Woking, how busy the"
"x36","streets and vivid the moving life about me.  So many people were"
"x36","abroad everywhere, busied in a thousand activities, that it seemed"
"x36","incredible that any great proportion of the population could have been"
"x36","slain.  But then I noticed how yellow were the skins of the people I"
"x36","met, how shaggy the hair of the men, how large and bright their eyes,"
"x36","and that every other man still wore his dirty rags.  Their faces"
"x36","seemed all with one of two expressions--a leaping exultation and"
"x36","energy or a grim resolution.  Save for the expression of the faces,"
"x36","London seemed a city of tramps.  The vestries were indiscriminately"
"x36","distributing bread sent us by the French government.  The ribs of the"
"x36","few horses showed dismally.  Haggard special constables with white"
"x36","badges stood at the corners of every street.  I saw little of the"
"x36","mischief wrought by the Martians until I reached Wellington Street,"
"x36","and there I saw the red weed clambering over the buttresses of"
"x36","Waterloo Bridge."
"x36",""
"x36","At the corner of the bridge, too, I saw one of the common contrasts"
"x36","of that grotesque time--a sheet of paper flaunting against a thicket"
"x36","of the red weed, transfixed by a stick that kept it in place.  It was"
"x36","the placard of the first newspaper to resume publication--the _Daily"
"x36","Mail_.  I bought a copy for a blackened shilling I found in my pocket."
"x36","Most of it was in blank, but the solitary compositor who did the thing"
"x36","had amused himself by making a grotesque scheme of advertisement"
"x36","stereo on the back page.  The matter he printed was emotional; the"
"x36","news organisation had not as yet found its way back.  I learned"
"x36","nothing fresh except that already in one week the examination of the"
"x36","Martian mechanisms had yielded astonishing results.  Among other"
"x36","things, the article assured me what I did not believe at the time,"
"x36","that the ""Secret of Flying,"" was discovered.  At Waterloo I found the"
"x36","free trains that were taking people to their homes.  The first rush"
"x36","was already over.  There were few people in the train, and I was in no"
"x36","mood for casual conversation.  I got a compartment to myself, and sat"
"x36","with folded arms, looking greyly at the sunlit devastation that flowed"
"x36","past the windows.  And just outside the terminus the train jolted over"
"x36","temporary rails, and on either side of the railway the houses were"
"x36","blackened ruins.  To Clapham Junction the face of London was grimy"
"x36","with powder of the Black Smoke, in spite of two days of thunderstorms"
"x36","and rain, and at Clapham Junction the line had been wrecked again;"
"x36","there were hundreds of out-of-work clerks and shopmen working side by"
"x36","side with the customary navvies, and we were jolted over a hasty"
"x36","relaying."
"x36",""
"x36","All down the line from there the aspect of the country was gaunt"
"x36","and unfamiliar; Wimbledon particularly had suffered.  Walton, by virtue"
"x36","of its unburned pine woods, seemed the least hurt of any place along"
"x36","the line.  The Wandle, the Mole, every little stream, was a heaped"
"x36","mass of red weed, in appearance between butcher's meat and pickled"
"x36","cabbage.  The Surrey pine woods were too dry, however, for the festoons"
"x36","of the red climber.  Beyond Wimbledon, within sight of the line, in"
"x36","certain nursery grounds, were the heaped masses of earth about the"
"x36","sixth cylinder.  A number of people were standing about it, and some"
"x36","sappers were busy in the midst of it.  Over it flaunted a Union Jack,"
"x36","flapping cheerfully in the morning breeze.  The nursery grounds were"
"x36","everywhere crimson with the weed, a wide expanse of livid colour cut"
"x36","with purple shadows, and very painful to the eye.  One's gaze went"
"x36","with infinite relief from the scorched greys and sullen reds of the"
"x36","foreground to the blue-green softness of the eastward hills."
"x36",""
"x36","The line on the London side of Woking station was still undergoing"
"x36","repair, so I descended at Byfleet station and took the road to"
"x36","Maybury, past the place where I and the artilleryman had talked to the"
"x36","hussars, and on by the spot where the Martian had appeared to me in"
"x36","the thunderstorm.  Here, moved by curiosity, I turned aside to find,"
"x36","among a tangle of red fronds, the warped and broken dog cart with the"
"x36","whitened bones of the horse scattered and gnawed.  For a time I stood"
"x36","regarding these vestiges. . . ."
"x36",""
"x36","Then I returned through the pine wood, neck-high with red weed here"
"x36","and there, to find the landlord of the Spotted Dog had already found"
"x36","burial, and so came home past the College Arms.  A man standing at an"
"x36","open cottage door greeted me by name as I passed."
"x36",""
"x36","I looked at my house with a quick flash of hope that faded"
"x36","immediately.  The door had been forced; it was unfast and was opening"
"x36","slowly as I approached."
"x36",""
"x36","It slammed again.  The curtains of my study fluttered out of the"
"x36","open window from which I and the artilleryman had watched the dawn.  No"
"x36","one had closed it since.  The smashed bushes were just as I had left"
"x36","them nearly four weeks ago.  I stumbled into the hall, and the house"
"x36","felt empty.  The stair carpet was ruffled and discoloured where I had"
"x36","crouched, soaked to the skin from the thunderstorm the night of the"
"x36","catastrophe.  Our muddy footsteps I saw still went up the stairs."
"x36",""
"x36","I followed them to my study, and found lying on my writing-table"
"x36","still, with the selenite paper weight upon it, the sheet of work I had"
"x36","left on the afternoon of the opening of the cylinder.  For a space I"
"x36","stood reading over my abandoned arguments.  It was a paper on the"
"x36","probable development of Moral Ideas with the development of the"
"x36","civilising process; and the last sentence was the opening of a"
"x36","prophecy: ""In about two hundred years,"" I had written, ""we may"
"x36","expect----""  The sentence ended abruptly.  I remembered my inability"
"x36","to fix my mind that morning, scarcely a month gone by, and how I had"
"x36","broken off to get my _Daily Chronicle_ from the newsboy.  I remembered"
"x36","how I went down to the garden gate as he came along, and how I had"
"x36","listened to his odd story of ""Men from Mars."""
"x36",""
"x36","I came down and went into the dining room.  There were the mutton"
"x36","and the bread, both far gone now in decay, and a beer bottle"
"x36","overturned, just as I and the artilleryman had left them.  My home was"
"x36","desolate.  I perceived the folly of the faint hope I had cherished so"
"x36","long.  And then a strange thing occurred.  ""It is no use,"" said a"
"x36","voice.  ""The house is deserted.  No one has been here these ten days."
"x36","Do not stay here to torment yourself.  No one escaped but you."""
"x36",""
"x36","I was startled.  Had I spoken my thought aloud?  I turned, and the"
"x36","French window was open behind me.  I made a step to it, and stood"
"x36","looking out."
"x36",""
"x36","And there, amazed and afraid, even as I stood amazed and afraid,"
"x36","were my cousin and my wife--my wife white and tearless.  She gave a"
"x36","faint cry."
"x36",""
"x36","""I came,"" she said.  ""I knew--knew----"""

"x36","My knowledge of comparative physiology is confined to a book or two,"

"x36","At any rate, in all the bodies of the Martians that were examined"

"x36","Martians used with such deadly effect, and the generator of the"
"x36","Heat-Rays remains a puzzle.  The terrible disasters at the Ealing"
"x36","and South Kensington laboratories have disinclined analysts for further"
"x36","investigations upon the latter.  Spectrum analysis of the black powder"
"x36","points unmistakably to the presence of an unknown element with a"
"x36","brilliant group of three lines in the green, and it is possible that"
"x36","it combines with argon to form a compound which acts at once with"
"x36","deadly effect upon some constituent in the blood.  But such unproven"
"x36","speculations will scarcely be of interest to the general reader, to"
"x36","whom this story is addressed.  None of the brown scum that drifted"
"x36","down the Thames after the destruction of Shepperton was examined at"
"x36","the time, and now none is forthcoming."
"x36",""
"x36","The results of an anatomical examination of the Martians, so far"
"x36","as the prowling dogs had left such an examination possible, I have"
"x36","already given.  But everyone is familiar with the magnificent and"
"x36","almost complete specimen in spirits at the Natural History Museum, and"
"x36","the countless drawings that have been made from it; and beyond that"
"x36","the interest of their physiology and structure is purely scientific."
"x36",""
"x36","A question of graver and universal interest is the possibility of"
"x36","another attack from the Martians.  I do not think that nearly enough"
"x36","attention is being given to this aspect of the matter.  At present the"
"x36","planet Mars is in conjunction, but with every return to opposition I,"
"x36","for one, anticipate a renewal of their adventure.  In any case, we"
"x36","should be prepared.  It seems to me that it should be possible to"
"x36","define the position of the gun from which the shots are discharged, to"
"x36","keep a sustained watch upon this part of the planet, and to anticipate"
"x36","the arrival of the next attack."
"x36",""
"x36","In that case the cylinder might be destroyed with dynamite or"
"x36","artillery before it was sufficiently cool for the Martians to emerge,"
"x36","or they might be butchered by means of guns so soon as the screw"
"x36","opened.  It seems to me that they have lost a vast advantage in the"
"x36","failure of their first surprise.  Possibly they see it in the same"
"x36","light."
"x36",""
"x36","Lessing has advanced excellent reasons for supposing that the"
"x36","Martians have actually succeeded in effecting a landing on the planet"
"x36","Venus.  Seven months ago now, Venus and Mars were in alignment with"
"x36","the sun; that is to say, Mars was in opposition from the point of view"
"x36","of an observer on Venus.  Subsequently a peculiar luminous and sinuous"
"x36","marking appeared on the unillumined half of the inner planet, and"
"x36","almost simultaneously a faint dark mark of a similar sinuous character"
"x36","was detected upon a photograph of the Martian disk.  One needs to see"
"x36","the drawings of these appearances in order to appreciate fully their"
"x36","remarkable resemblance in character."
"x36",""
"x36","At any rate, whether we expect another invasion or not, our views"
"x36","of the human future must be greatly modified by these events.  We have"
"x36","learned now that we cannot regard this planet as being fenced in and a"
"x36","secure abiding place for Man; we can never anticipate the unseen good"
"x36","or evil that may come upon us suddenly out of space.  It may be that"
"x36","in the larger design of the universe this invasion from Mars is not"
"x36","without its ultimate benefit for men; it has robbed us of that serene"
"x36","confidence in the future which is the most fruitful source of"
"x36","decadence, the gifts to human science it has brought are enormous, and"
"x36","it has done much to promote the conception of the commonweal of"
"x36","mankind.  It may be that across the immensity of space the Martians"
"x36","have watched the fate of these pioneers of theirs and learned their"
"x36","lesson, and that on the planet Venus they have found a securer"
"x36","settlement.  Be that as it may, for many years yet there will"
"x36","certainly be no relaxation of the eager scrutiny of the Martian disk,"
"x36","and those fiery darts of the sky, the shooting stars, will bring with"
"x36","them as they fall an unavoidable apprehension to all the sons of men."
"x36",""
"x36","The broadening of men's views that has resulted can scarcely be"
"x36","exaggerated.  Before the cylinder fell there was a general persuasion"
"x36","that through all the deep of space no life existed beyond the petty"
"x36","surface of our minute sphere.  Now we see further.  If the Martians"
"x36","can reach Venus, there is no reason to suppose that the thing is"
"x36","impossible for men, and when the slow cooling of the sun makes this"
"x36","earth uninhabitable, as at last it must do, it may be that the thread"
"x36","of life that has begun here will have streamed out and caught our"
"x36","sister planet within its toils."
"x36",""
"x36","Dim and wonderful is the vision I have conjured up in my mind of"
"x36","life spreading slowly from this little seed bed of the solar system"
"x36","throughout the inanimate vastness of sidereal space.  But that is a"
"x36","remote dream.  It may be, on the other hand, that the destruction of"
"x36","the Martians is only a reprieve.  To them, and not to us, perhaps, is"
"x36","the future ordained."
"x36",""
"x36","I must confess the stress and danger of the time have left an"
"x36","abiding sense of doubt and insecurity in my mind.  I sit in my study"
"x36","writing by lamplight, and suddenly I see again the healing valley"
"x36","below set with writhing flames, and feel the house behind and about me"
"x36","empty and desolate.  I go out into the Byfleet Road, and vehicles pass"
"x36","me, a butcher boy in a cart, a cabful of visitors, a workman on a"
"x36","bicycle, children going to school, and suddenly they become vague and"
"x36","unreal, and I hurry again with the artilleryman through the hot,"
"x36","brooding silence.  Of a night I see the black powder darkening the"
"x36","silent streets, and the contorted bodies shrouded in that layer; they"
"x36","rise upon me tattered and dog-bitten.  They gibber and grow fiercer,"
"x36","paler, uglier, mad distortions of humanity at last, and I wake, cold"
"x36","and wretched, in the darkness of the night."
"x36",""
"x36","I go to London and see the busy multitudes in Fleet Street and the"
"x36","Strand, and it comes across my mind that they are but the ghosts of"
"x36","the past, haunting the streets that I have seen silent and wretched,"
"x36","going to and fro, phantasms in a dead city, the mockery of life in a"
"x36","galvanised body.  And strange, too, it is to stand on Primrose Hill,"
"x36","as I did but a day before writing this last chapter, to see the great"
"x36","province of houses, dim and blue through the haze of the smoke and"
"x36","mist, vanishing at last into the vague lower sky, to see the people"
"x36","walking to and fro among the flower beds on the hill, to see the"
"x36","sight-seers about the Martian machine that stands there still, to hear"
"x36","the tumult of playing children, and to recall the time when I saw it"
"x36","all bright and clear-cut, hard and silent, under the dawn of that last"
"x36","great day. . . ."
"x36",""
"x36","And strangest of all is it to hold my wife's hand again, and to think"
"x36","that I have counted her, and that she has counted me, among the dead."

"x159","INTRODUCTION."
"x159",""
"x159","ON February the First 1887, the Lady Vain was lost by collision"
"x159","with a derelict when about the latitude 1 degree S. and longitude"
"x159","107 degrees W."
"x159",""
"x159","On January the Fifth, 1888--that is eleven months and four days after--my"
"x159","uncle, Edward Prendick, a private gentleman, who certainly went"
"x159","aboard the Lady Vain at Callao, and who had been considered drowned,"
"x159","was picked up in latitude 5 degrees 3' S. and longitude 101 degrees W."
"x159","in a small open boat of which the name was illegible, but which is"
"x159","supposed to have belonged to the missing schooner Ipecacuanha."
"x159","He gave such a strange account of himself that he was supposed demented."
"x159","Subsequently he alleged that his mind was a blank from the moment"
"x159","of his escape from the Lady Vain.  His case was discussed among"
"x159","psychologists at the time as a curious instance of the lapse"
"x159","of memory consequent upon physical and mental stress."
"x159","The following narrative was found among his papers by the undersigned,"
"x159","his nephew and heir, but unaccompanied by any definite request"
"x159","for publication."
"x159",""
"x159","The only island known to exist in the region in which my uncle was"
"x159","picked up is Noble's Isle, a small volcanic islet and uninhabited."
"x159","It was visited in 1891 by H. M. S. Scorpion.  A party of sailors"
"x159","then landed, but found nothing living thereon except certain curious"
"x159","white moths, some hogs and rabbits, and some rather peculiar rats."
"x159","So that this narrative is without confirmation in its most"
"x159","essential particular.  With that understood, there seems no harm"
"x159","in putting this strange story before the public in accordance,"
"x159","as I believe, with my uncle's intentions.  There is at least this"
"x159","much in its behalf:  my uncle passed out of human knowledge about"
"x159","latitude 5 degrees S. and longitude 105 degrees E., and reappeared"
"x159","in the same part of the ocean after a space of eleven months."
"x159","In some way he must have lived during the interval.  And it seems that"
"x159","a schooner called the Ipecacuanha with a drunken captain, John Davies,"
"x159","did start from Africa with a puma and certain other animals aboard"
"x159","in January, 1887, that the vessel was well known at several ports"
"x159","in the South Pacific, and that it finally disappeared from those seas"
"x159","(with a considerable amount of copra aboard), sailing to its unknown"
"x159","fate from Bayna in December, 1887, a date that tallies entirely with my"
"x159","uncle's story."

"x159","I.  IN THE DINGEY OF THE ""LADY VAIN."""
"x159",""
"x159",""
"x159","I DO not propose to add anything to what has already been written"
"x159","concerning the loss of the ""Lady Vain.""  As everyone knows,"
"x159","she collided with a derelict when ten days out from Callao."
"x159","The longboat, with seven of the crew, was picked up eighteen days after"
"x159","by H. M. gunboat ""Myrtle,"" and the story of their terrible privations"
"x159","has become quite as well known as the far more horrible ""Medusa"" case."
"x159","But I have to add to the published story of the ""Lady Vain"""
"x159","another, possibly as horrible and far stranger.  It has hitherto"
"x159","been supposed that the four men who were in the dingey perished,"
"x159","but this is incorrect.  I have the best of evidence for this assertion:"
"x159","I was one of the four men."
"x159",""
"x159","But in the first place I must state that there never were four men"
"x159","in the dingey,--the number was three.  Constans, who was ""seen"
"x159","by the captain to jump into the gig,""{1} luckily for us and unluckily"
"x159","for himself did not reach us.  He came down out of the tangle"
"x159","of ropes under the stays of the smashed bowsprit, some small rope"
"x159","caught his heel as he let go, and he hung for a moment head downward,"
"x159","and then fell and struck a block or spar floating in the water."
"x159","We pulled towards him, but he never came up."
"x159",""
"x159","{1} Daily News, March 17, 1887."
"x159",""
"x159","I say luckily for us he did not reach us, and I might almost"
"x159","say luckily for himself; for we had only a small beaker"
"x159","of water and some soddened ship's biscuits with us, so sudden"
"x159","had been the alarm, so unprepared the ship for any disaster."
"x159","We thought the people on the launch would be better provisioned"
"x159","(though it seems they were not), and we tried to hail them.  They could"
"x159","not have heard us, and the next morning when the drizzle cleared,--which"
"x159","was not until past midday,--we could see nothing of them.  We could"
"x159","not stand up to look about us, because of the pitching of the boat."
"x159","The two other men who had escaped so far with me were a man named Helmar,"
"x159","a passenger like myself, and a seaman whose name I don't know,--a short"
"x159","sturdy man, with a stammer."
"x159",""
"x159","We drifted famishing, and, after our water had come to an end,"
"x159","tormented by an intolerable thirst, for eight days altogether."
"x159","After the second day the sea subsided slowly to a glassy calm.  It is"
"x159","quite impossible for the ordinary reader to imagine those eight days."
"x159","He has not, luckily for himself, anything in his memory to imagine with."
"x159","After the first day we said little to one another, and lay"
"x159","in our places in the boat and stared at the horizon, or watched,"
"x159","with eyes that grew larger and more haggard every day, the misery"
"x159","and weakness gaining upon our companions.  The sun became pitiless."
"x159","The water ended on the fourth day, and we were already thinking"
"x159","strange things and saying them with our eyes; but it was, I think,"
"x159","the sixth before Helmar gave voice to the thing we had all been thinking."
"x159","I remember our voices were dry and thin, so that we bent towards"
"x159","one another and spared our words.  I stood out against it with all"
"x159","my might, was rather for scuttling the boat and perishing together"
"x159","among the sharks that followed us; but when Helmar said that if his"
"x159","proposal was accepted we should have drink, the sailor came round"
"x159","to him."
"x159",""
"x159","I would not draw lots however, and in the night the sailor whispered"
"x159","to Helmar again and again, and I sat in the bows with my clasp-knife"
"x159","in my hand, though I doubt if I had the stuff in me to fight;"
"x159","and in the morning I agreed to Helmar's proposal, and we handed"
"x159","halfpence to find the odd man.  The lot fell upon the sailor;"
"x159","but he was the strongest of us and would not abide by it, and attacked"
"x159","Helmar with his hands.  They grappled together and almost stood up."
"x159","I crawled along the boat to them, intending to help Helmar by grasping"
"x159","the sailor's leg; but the sailor stumbled with the swaying of the boat,"
"x159","and the two fell upon the gunwale and rolled overboard together."
"x159","They sank like stones.  I remember laughing at that, and wondering"
"x159","why I laughed.  The laugh caught me suddenly like a thing"
"x159","from without."
"x159",""
"x159","I lay across one of the thwarts for I know not how long,"
"x159","thinking that if I had the strength I would drink sea-water"
"x159","and madden myself to die quickly.  And even as I lay there I saw,"
"x159","with no more interest than if it had been a picture, a sail come"
"x159","up towards me over the sky-line. My mind must have been wandering,"
"x159","and yet I remember all that happened, quite distinctly."
"x159","I remember how my head swayed with the seas, and the horizon"
"x159","with the sail above it danced up and down; but I also remember"
"x159","as distinctly that I had a persuasion that I was dead, and that I"
"x159","thought what a jest it was that they should come too late by such"
"x159","a little to catch me in my body."
"x159",""
"x159","For an endless period, as it seemed to me, I lay with my head"
"x159","on the thwart watching the schooner (she was a little ship,"
"x159","schooner-rigged fore and aft) come up out of the sea."
"x159","She kept tacking to and fro in a widening compass, for she was"
"x159","sailing dead into the wind.  It never entered my head to attempt"
"x159","to attract attention, and I do not remember anything distinctly after"
"x159","the sight of her side until I found myself in a little cabin aft."
"x159","There's a dim half-memory of being lifted up to the gangway, and of"
"x159","a big round countenance covered with freckles and surrounded with red"
"x159","hair staring at me over the bulwarks.  I also had a disconnected"
"x159","impression of a dark face, with extraordinary eyes, close to mine;"
"x159","but that I thought was a nightmare, until I met it again."
"x159","I fancy I recollect some stuff being poured in between my teeth;"

"x159","A youngish man with flaxen hair, a bristly straw-coloured moustache,"
"x159","and a dropping nether lip, was sitting and holding my wrist."
"x159","For a minute we stared at each other without speaking."
"x159","He had watery grey eyes, oddly void of expression."
"x159","Then just overhead came a sound like an iron bedstead being"
"x159","knocked about, and the low angry growling of some large animal."
"x159","At the same time the man spoke.  He repeated his question,--""How do you"
"x159","feel now?"""
"x159",""
"x159","I think I said I felt all right.  I could not recollect how I"

"x159","""Have some of this,"" said he, and gave me a dose of some"

"x159","He lent me some duck things of his own, for those I had worn in the boat"
"x159","had been thrown overboard.  They were rather loose for me, for he was"
"x159","large and long in his limbs.  He told me casually that the captain"
"x159","was three-parts drunk in his own cabin.  As I assumed the clothes,"
"x159","I began asking him some questions about the destination of the ship."
"x159","He said the ship was bound to Hawaii, but that it had to land"
"x159","him first."

"x159","III.  THE STRANGE FACE."
"x159",""

"x159","WE left the cabin and found a man at the companion obstructing"
"x159","our way.  He was standing on the ladder with his back to us,"
"x159","peering over the combing of the hatchway.  He was, I could see,"
"x159","a misshapen man, short, broad, and clumsy, with a crooked back,"
"x159","a hairy neck, and a head sunk between his shoulders.  He was dressed"
"x159","in dark-blue serge, and had peculiarly thick, coarse, black hair."
"x159","I heard the unseen dogs growl furiously, and forthwith he ducked"
"x159","back,--coming into contact with the hand I put out to fend him off"
"x159","from myself.  He turned with animal swiftness."
"x159",""
"x159","In some indefinable way the black face thus flashed upon me"
"x159","shocked me profoundly.  It was a singularly deformed one."
"x159","The facial part projected, forming something dimly suggestive"
"x159","of a muzzle, and the huge half-open mouth showed as big white teeth"
"x159","as I had ever seen in a human mouth.  His eyes were blood-shot"
"x159","at the edges, with scarcely a rim of white round the hazel pupils."
"x159","There was a curious glow of excitement in his face."
"x159",""
"x159","""Confound you!"" said Montgomery.  ""Why the devil don't you get"
"x159","out of the way?"""
"x159",""
"x159","The black-faced man started aside without a word."
"x159","I went on up the companion, staring at him instinctively"
"x159","as I did so.  Montgomery stayed at the foot for a moment."
"x159","""You have no business here, you know,"" he said in a deliberate tone."
"x159","""Your place is forward."""
"x159",""
"x159","The black-faced man cowered.  ""They--won't have me forward."""
"x159","He spoke slowly, with a queer, hoarse quality in his voice."
"x159",""
"x159","""Won't have you forward!"" said Montgomery, in a menacing voice."
"x159","""But I tell you to go!""  He was on the brink of saying something further,"
"x159","then looked up at me suddenly and followed me up the ladder."
"x159",""
"x159","I had paused half way through the hatchway, looking back, still astonished"
"x159","beyond measure at the grotesque ugliness of this black-faced creature."
"x159","I had never beheld such a repulsive and extraordinary face before,"
"x159","and yet--if the contradiction is credible--I experienced at"
"x159","the same time an odd feeling that in some way I _had_ already"
"x159","encountered exactly the features and gestures that now amazed me."
"x159","Afterwards it occurred to me that probably I had seen him as I"
"x159","was lifted aboard; and yet that scarcely satisfied my suspicion"
"x159","of a previous acquaintance.  Yet how one could have set eyes on"
"x159","so singular a face and yet have forgotten the precise occasion,"
"x159","passed my imagination."
"x159",""
"x159","Montgomery's movement to follow me released my attention, and I"
"x159","turned and looked about me at the flush deck of the little schooner."
"x159","I was already half prepared by the sounds I had heard for what I saw."
"x159","Certainly I never beheld a deck so dirty.  It was littered with"
"x159","scraps of carrot, shreds of green stuff, and indescribable filth."
"x159","Fastened by chains to the mainmast were a number of grisly staghounds,"
"x159","who now began leaping and barking at me, and by the mizzen a huge puma was"
"x159","cramped in a little iron cage far too small even to give it turning room."
"x159","Farther under the starboard bulwark were some big hutches containing"
"x159","a number of rabbits, and a solitary llama was squeezed in a mere"
"x159","box of a cage forward.  The dogs were muzzled by leather straps."
"x159","The only human being on deck was a gaunt and silent sailor at"
"x159","the wheel."
"x159",""
"x159","The patched and dirty spankers were tense before the wind,"
"x159","and up aloft the little ship seemed carrying every sail she had."
"x159","The sky was clear, the sun midway down the western sky;"
"x159","long waves, capped by the breeze with froth, were running with us."
"x159","We went past the steersman to the taffrail, and saw the water come"
"x159","foaming under the stern and the bubbles go dancing and vanishing"
"x159","in her wake.  I turned and surveyed the unsavoury length of"
"x159","the ship."
"x159",""
"x159","""Is this an ocean menagerie?"" said I."
"x159",""
"x159","""Looks like it,"" said Montgomery."
"x159",""
"x159","""What are these beasts for?  Merchandise, curios?  Does the captain"
"x159","think he is going to sell them somewhere in the South Seas?"""
"x159",""
"x159","""It looks like it, doesn't it?"" said Montgomery, and turned towards"
"x159","the wake again."
"x159",""
"x159","Suddenly we heard a yelp and a volley of furious blasphemy"
"x159","from the companion hatchway, and the deformed man with the black"
"x159","face came up hurriedly.  He was immediately followed by a heavy"
"x159","red-haired man in a white cap.  At the sight of the former"
"x159","the staghounds, who had all tired of barking at me by this time,"
"x159","became furiously excited, howling and leaping against their chains."
"x159","The black hesitated before them, and this gave the red-haired man"
"x159","time to come up with him and deliver a tremendous blow between"
"x159","the shoulder-blades. The poor devil went down like a felled ox,"
"x159","and rolled in the dirt among the furiously excited dogs."
"x159","It was lucky for him that they were muzzled.  The red-haired man gave"
"x159","a yawp of exultation and stood staggering, and as it seemed to me"
"x159","in serious danger of either going backwards down the companion hatchway"
"x159","or forwards upon his victim."
"x159",""
"x159","So soon as the second man had appeared, Montgomery had started forward."
"x159","""Steady on there!"" he cried, in a tone of remonstrance."
"x159","A couple of sailors appeared on the forecastle.  The black-faced man,"
"x159","howling in a singular voice rolled about under the feet of the dogs."
"x159","No one attempted to help him.  The brutes did their best to worry him,"
"x159","butting their muzzles at him.  There was a quick dance of their"
"x159","lithe grey-figured bodies over the clumsy, prostrate figure."
"x159","The sailors forward shouted, as though it was admirable sport."
"x159","Montgomery gave an angry exclamation, and went striding down"
"x159","the deck, and I followed him.  The black-faced man scrambled"
"x159","up and staggered forward, going and leaning over the bulwark"
"x159","by the main shrouds, where he remained, panting and glaring"
"x159","over his shoulder at the dogs.  The red-haired man laughed a"
"x159","satisfied laugh."
"x159",""
"x159","""Look here, Captain,"" said Montgomery, with his lisp a little accentuated,"
"x159","gripping the elbows of the red-haired man, ""this won't do!"""
"x159",""
"x159","I stood behind Montgomery.  The captain came half round,"
"x159","and regarded him with the dull and solemn eyes of a drunken man."
"x159","""Wha' won't do?"" he said, and added, after looking sleepily into"
"x159","Montgomery's face for a minute, ""Blasted Sawbones!"""
"x159",""
"x159","With a sudden movement he shook his arms free, and after two"
"x159","ineffectual attempts stuck his freckled fists into his side pockets."

"x159","and staggered towards the side.  ""Do what I like on my own ship,"""
"x159","he said."
"x159",""
"x159","I think Montgomery might have left him then, seeing the brute was drunk;"

"x159","to the bulwarks."

"x159","""Look you here, Captain,"" he said; ""that man of mine is not to be"
"x159","ill-treated. He has been hazed ever since he came aboard."""
"x159",""
"x159","For a minute, alcoholic fumes kept the captain speechless."
"x159","""Blasted Sawbones!"" was all he considered necessary."
"x159",""
"x159","I could see that Montgomery had one of those slow, pertinacious tempers"
"x159","that will warm day after day to a white heat, and never again"
"x159","cool to forgiveness; and I saw too that this quarrel had been"
"x159","some time growing.  ""The man's drunk,"" said I, perhaps officiously;"
"x159","""you'll do no good."""
"x159",""
"x159","Montgomery gave an ugly twist to his dropping lip.  ""He's always drunk."
"x159","Do you think that excuses his assaulting his passengers?"""
"x159",""
"x159","""My ship,"" began the captain, waving his hand unsteadily"
"x159","towards the cages, ""was a clean ship.  Look at it now!"""
"x159","It was certainly anything but clean.  ""Crew,"" continued the captain,"
"x159","""clean, respectable crew."""

"x159",""
"x159","Montgomery turned away.  ""_You_ leave that man alone, anyhow,"" he said,"
"x159","nodding his head as he spoke."
"x159",""
"x159","But the captain meant to quarrel now.  He raised his voice.  ""If he comes"

"x159","Cut out his blasted insides!  Who are you, to tell me what I'm to do?"
"x159","I tell you I'm captain of this ship,--captain and owner."
"x159","I'm the law here, I tell you,--the law and the prophets."

"x159","began some abuse even fouler than the last.  ""Shut up!"" I said,"
"x159","turning on him sharply, for I had seen danger in Montgomery's white face."
"x159","With that I brought the downpour on myself."

"x159",""
"x159","THAT night land was sighted after sundown, and the schooner"
"x159","hove to.  Montgomery intimated that was his destination."
"x159","It was too far to see any details; it seemed to me then simply"
"x159","a low-lying patch of dim blue in the uncertain blue-grey sea."
"x159","An almost vertical streak of smoke went up from it into the sky."
"x159","The captain was not on deck when it was sighted.  After he had vented"
"x159","his wrath on me he had staggered below, and I understand he went to sleep"
"x159","on the floor of his own cabin.  The mate practically assumed the command."
"x159","He was the gaunt, taciturn individual we had seen at the wheel."
"x159","Apparently he was in an evil temper with Montgomery.  He took"
"x159","not the slightest notice of either of us.  We dined with him in a"
"x159","sulky silence, after a few ineffectual efforts on my part to talk."
"x159","It struck me too that the men regarded my companion and his animals"
"x159","in a singularly unfriendly manner.  I found Montgomery very reticent"
"x159","about his purpose with these creatures, and about his destination;"
"x159","and though I was sensible of a growing curiosity as to both, I did not"
"x159","press him."

"x159","We remained talking on the quarter deck until the sky was thick"

"x159","The puma lay crouched together, watching us with shining eyes, a black"
"x159","heap in the corner of its cage.  Montgomery produced some cigars."
"x159","He talked to me of London in a tone of half-painful reminiscence,"
"x159","asking all kinds of questions about changes that had taken place."
"x159","He spoke like a man who had loved his life there, and had been"
"x159","suddenly and irrevocably cut off from it.  I gossiped as well as I"
"x159","could of this and that.  All the time the strangeness of him was"
"x159","shaping itself in my mind; and as I talked I peered at his odd,"
"x159","pallid face in the dim light of the binnacle lantern behind me.  Then I"
"x159","looked out at the darkling sea, where in the dimness his little island"
"x159","was hidden."
"x159",""
"x159","This man, it seemed to me, had come out of Immensity merely to save"
"x159","my life.  To-morrow he would drop over the side, and vanish again out"
"x159","of my existence.  Even had it been under commonplace circumstances,"
"x159","it would have made me a trifle thoughtful; but in the first place was"
"x159","the singularity of an educated man living on this unknown little island,"
"x159","and coupled with that the extraordinary nature of his luggage."
"x159","I found myself repeating the captain's question. What did he want"
"x159","with the beasts?  Why, too, had he pretended they were not his when I"
"x159","had remarked about them at first?  Then, again, in his personal attendant"
"x159","there was a bizarre quality which had impressed me profoundly."
"x159","These circumstances threw a haze of mystery round the man.  They laid"
"x159","hold of my imagination, and hampered my tongue."

"x159","Towards midnight our talk of London died away, and we stood"
"x159","side by side leaning over the bulwarks and staring dreamily"

"x159","""But, Montgomery,"" I appealed."
"x159",""
"x159","He distorted his lower lip, and nodded his head hopelessly at"
"x159","the grey-haired man beside him, to indicate his powerlessness to help me."
"x159",""
"x159","""I'll see to _you_, presently,"" said the captain."
"x159",""
"x159","Then began a curious three-cornered altercation."
"x159","Alternately I appealed to one and another of the three men,--first"
"x159","to the grey-haired man to let me land, and then to the drunken"
"x159","captain to keep me aboard.  I even bawled entreaties to the sailors."
"x159","Montgomery said never a word, only shook his head."
"x159","""You're going overboard, I tell you,"" was the captain's refrain."
"x159","""Law be damned!  I'm king here.""  At last I must confess"
"x159","my voice suddenly broke in the middle of a vigorous threat."
"x159","I felt a gust of hysterical petulance, and went aft and stared dismally"
"x159","at nothing."
"x159",""
"x159","Meanwhile the sailors progressed rapidly with the task of"
"x159","unshipping the packages and caged animals.  A large launch,"
"x159","with two standing lugs, lay under the lee of the schooner;"
"x159","and into this the strange assortment of goods were swung."
"x159","I did not then see the hands from the island that were receiving"
"x159","the packages, for the hull of the launch was hidden from me"
"x159","by the side of the schooner.  Neither Montgomery nor his companion"
"x159","took the slightest notice of me, but busied themselves in assisting"
"x159","and directing the four or five sailors who were unloading the goods."
"x159","The captain went forward interfering rather than assisting."
"x159","I was alternately despairful and desperate.  Once or twice"
"x159","as I stood waiting there for things to accomplish themselves,"
"x159","I could not resist an impulse to laugh at my miserable quandary."
"x159","I felt all the wretcheder for the lack of a breakfast."
"x159","Hunger and a lack of blood-corpuscles take all the manhood from a man."
"x159","I perceived pretty clearly that I had not the stamina"
"x159","either to resist what the captain chose to do to expel me,"
"x159","or to force myself upon Montgomery and his companion."
"x159","So I waited passively upon fate; and the work of transferring"
"x159","Montgomery's possessions to the launch went on as if I did"
"x159","not exist."
"x159",""
"x159","Presently that work was finished, and then came a struggle."
"x159","I was hauled, resisting weakly enough, to the gangway."
"x159","Even then I noticed the oddness of the brown faces of the men who were"
"x159","with Montgomery in the launch; but the launch was now fully laden,"
"x159","and was shoved off hastily.  A broadening gap of green water"
"x159","appeared under me, and I pushed back with all my strength to avoid"
"x159","falling headlong.  The hands in the launch shouted derisively,"
"x159","and I heard Montgomery curse at them; and then the captain,"
"x159","the mate, and one of the seamen helping him, ran me aft towards"
"x159","the stern."
"x159",""
"x159","The dingey of the ""Lady Vain"" had been towing behind; it was"
"x159","half full of water, had no oars, and was quite unvictualled."
"x159","I refused to go aboard her, and flung myself full length on the deck."
"x159","In the end, they swung me into her by a rope (for they had no"
"x159","stern ladder), and then they cut me adrift.  I drifted slowly"
"x159","from the schooner.  In a kind of stupor I watched all hands take"
"x159","to the rigging, and slowly but surely she came round to the wind;"
"x159","the sails fluttered, and then bellied out as the wind came into them."
"x159","I stared at her weather-beaten side heeling steeply towards me;"
"x159","and then she passed out of my range of view."
"x159",""
"x159","I did not turn my head to follow her.  At first I could scarcely"
"x159","believe what had happened.  I crouched in the bottom of the dingey,"
"x159","stunned, and staring blankly at the vacant, oily sea.  Then I realised"
"x159","that I was in that little hell of mine again, now half swamped;"
"x159","and looking back over the gunwale, I saw the schooner standing away"
"x159","from me, with the red-haired captain mocking at me over the taffrail,"
"x159","and turning towards the island saw the launch growing smaller as she"
"x159","approached the beach."
"x159",""
"x159","Abruptly the cruelty of this desertion became clear to me."
"x159","I had no means of reaching the land unless I should chance to drift there."
"x159","I was still weak, you must remember, from my exposure in the boat;"
"x159","I was empty and very faint, or I should have had more heart."
"x159","But as it was I suddenly began to sob and weep, as I had never done"
"x159","since I was a little child.  The tears ran down my face.  In a passion"
"x159","of despair I struck with my fists at the water in the bottom of the boat,"
"x159","and kicked savagely at the gunwale.  I prayed aloud for God to let"
"x159","me die."

"x159","VI.  THE EVIL-LOOKING BOATMEN."
"x159",""
"x159",""
"x159","BUT the islanders, seeing that I was really adrift, took pity on me."
"x159","I drifted very slowly to the eastward, approaching the island slantingly;"
"x159","and presently I saw, with hysterical relief, the launch come round and"
"x159","return towards me.  She was heavily laden, and I could make out as she"
"x159","drew nearer Montgomery's white-haired, broad-shouldered companion sitting"
"x159","cramped up with the dogs and several packing-cases in the stern sheets."
"x159","This individual stared fixedly at me without moving or speaking."
"x159","The black-faced cripple was glaring at me as fixedly in the bows"
"x159","near the puma.  There were three other men besides,--three strange"
"x159","brutish-looking fellows, at whom the staghounds were snarling savagely."
"x159","Montgomery, who was steering, brought the boat by me, and rising,"
"x159","caught and fastened my painter to the tiller to tow me, for there was no"
"x159","room aboard."
"x159",""
"x159","I had recovered from my hysterical phase by this time"
"x159","and answered his hail, as he approached, bravely enough."
"x159","I told him the dingey was nearly swamped, and he reached me a piggin."
"x159","I was jerked back as the rope tightened between the boats."
"x159","For some time I was busy baling."
"x159",""
"x159","It was not until I had got the water under (for the water"
"x159","in the dingey had been shipped; the boat was perfectly sound)"
"x159","that I had leisure to look at the people in the launch again."
"x159",""
"x159","The white-haired man I found was still regarding me steadfastly,"
"x159","but with an expression, as I now fancied, of some perplexity."
"x159","When my eyes met his, he looked down at the staghound that sat"
"x159","between his knees.  He was a powerfully-built man, as I have said,"
"x159","with a fine forehead and rather heavy features; but his eyes"
"x159","had that odd drooping of the skin above the lids which often"
"x159","comes with advancing years, and the fall of his heavy mouth"
"x159","at the corners gave him an expression of pugnacious resolution."
"x159","He talked to Montgomery in a tone too low for me to hear."
"x159",""
"x159","From him my eyes travelled to his three men; and a strange crew they were."
"x159","I saw only their faces, yet there was something in their"
"x159","faces--I knew not what--that gave me a queer spasm of disgust."
"x159","I looked steadily at them, and the impression did not pass,"
"x159","though I failed to see what had occasioned it.  They seemed"
"x159","to me then to be brown men; but their limbs were oddly swathed"
"x159","in some thin, dirty, white stuff down even to the fingers and feet:"
"x159","I have never seen men so wrapped up before, and women so only in the East."
"x159","They wore turbans too, and thereunder peered out their elfin"
"x159","faces at me,--faces with protruding lower-jaws and bright eyes."
"x159","They had lank black hair, almost like horsehair, and seemed"
"x159","as they sat to exceed in stature any race of men I have seen."
"x159","The white-haired man, who I knew was a good six feet in height,"
"x159","sat a head below any one of the three.  I found afterwards that really"
"x159","none were taller than myself; but their bodies were abnormally long,"
"x159","and the thigh-part of the leg short and curiously twisted."
"x159","At any rate, they were an amazingly ugly gang, and over the heads"
"x159","of them under the forward lug peered the black face of the man whose"
"x159","eyes were luminous in the dark.  As I stared at them, they met my gaze;"
"x159","and then first one and then another turned away from my direct stare,"
"x159","and looked at me in an odd, furtive manner.  It occurred to me that I"
"x159","was perhaps annoying them, and I turned my attention to the island"
"x159","we were approaching."
"x159",""
"x159","It was low, and covered with thick vegetation,--chiefly a kind of palm,"
"x159","that was new to me.  From one point a thin white thread of vapour rose"
"x159","slantingly to an immense height, and then frayed out like a down feather."
"x159","We were now within the embrace of a broad bay flanked on either"
"x159","hand by a low promontory.  The beach was of dull-grey sand,"
"x159","and sloped steeply up to a ridge, perhaps sixty or seventy feet above"
"x159","the sea-level, and irregularly set with trees and undergrowth."
"x159","Half way up was a square enclosure of some greyish stone, which I found"
"x159","subsequently was built partly of coral and partly of pumiceous lava."
"x159","Two thatched roofs peeped from within this enclosure."
"x159","A man stood awaiting us at the water's edge.  I fancied while we"
"x159","were still far off that I saw some other and very grotesque-looking"
"x159","creatures scuttle into the bushes upon the slope; but I saw nothing"
"x159","of these as we drew nearer.  This man was of a moderate size,"
"x159","and with a black negroid face.  He had a large, almost lipless,"
"x159","mouth, extraordinary lank arms, long thin feet, and bow-legs,"
"x159","and stood with his heavy face thrust forward staring at us."
"x159","He was dressed like Montgomery and his white-haired companion,"
"x159","in jacket and trousers of blue serge.  As we came still nearer,"
"x159","this individual began to run to and fro on the beach, making the most"
"x159","grotesque movements."
"x159",""
"x159","At a word of command from Montgomery, the four men in the launch"
"x159","sprang up, and with singularly awkward gestures struck the lugs."
"x159","Montgomery steered us round and into a narrow little dock excavated"
"x159","in the beach.  Then the man on the beach hastened towards us."
"x159","This dock, as I call it, was really a mere ditch just long"
"x159","enough at this phase of the tide to take the longboat."
"x159","I heard the bows ground in the sand, staved the dingey off the rudder"
"x159","of the big boat with my piggin, and freeing the painter, landed."
"x159","The three muffled men, with the clumsiest movements, scrambled out"
"x159","upon the sand, and forthwith set to landing the cargo, assisted by"
"x159","the man on the beach.  I was struck especially by the curious"
"x159","movements of the legs of the three swathed and bandaged boatmen,--not"
"x159","stiff they were, but distorted in some odd way, almost as if they"
"x159","were jointed in the wrong place.  The dogs were still snarling,"
"x159","and strained at their chains after these men, as the white-haired"
"x159","man landed with them.  The three big fellows spoke to one another"
"x159","in odd guttural tones, and the man who had waited for us on"
"x159","the beach began chattering to them excitedly--a foreign language,"
"x159","as I fancied--as they laid hands on some bales piled near the stern."
"x159","Somewhere I had heard such a voice before, and I could not think where."
"x159","The white-haired man stood, holding in a tumult of six dogs, and bawling"
"x159","orders over their din.  Montgomery, having unshipped the rudder,"
"x159","landed likewise, and all set to work at unloading.  I was too faint,"
"x159","what with my long fast and the sun beating down on my bare head, to offer"
"x159","any assistance."
"x159",""
"x159","Presently the white-haired man seemed to recollect my presence,"
"x159","and came up to me."
"x159",""
"x159","""You look,"" said he, ""as though you had scarcely breakfasted."""
"x159","His little eyes were a brilliant black under his heavy brows."
"x159","""I must apologise for that.  Now you are our guest, we must"
"x159","make you comfortable,--though you are uninvited, you know."""
"x159","He looked keenly into my face.  ""Montgomery says you are an educated man,"
"x159","Mr. Prendick; says you know something of science.  May I ask what"
"x159","that signifies?"""
"x159",""
"x159","I told him I had spent some years at the Royal College of Science,"
"x159","and had done some researches in biology under Huxley.  He raised"
"x159","his eyebrows slightly at that."
"x159",""
"x159","""That alters the case a little, Mr. Prendick,"" he said,"
"x159","with a trifle more respect in his manner.  ""As it happens,"
"x159","we are biologists here.  This is a biological station--of a sort."""
"x159","His eye rested on the men in white who were busily hauling the puma,"
"x159","on rollers, towards the walled yard.  ""I and Montgomery, at least,"""
"x159","he added.  Then, ""When you will be able to get away, I can't say."
"x159","We're off the track to anywhere.  We see a ship once in a twelve-month"
"x159","or so."""
"x159",""
"x159","He left me abruptly, and went up the beach past this group, and I"
"x159","think entered the enclosure.  The other two men were with Montgomery,"
"x159","erecting a pile of smaller packages on a low-wheeled truck."
"x159","The llama was still on the launch with the rabbit hutches;"
"x159","the staghounds were still lashed to the thwarts."
"x159","The pile of things completed, all three men laid hold of the truck"
"x159","and began shoving the ton-weight or so upon it after the puma."
"x159","Presently Montgomery left them, and coming back to me held out"
"x159","his hand."
"x159",""
"x159","""I'm glad,"" said he, ""for my own part.  That captain was a silly ass."
"x159","He'd have made things lively for you."""
"x159",""
"x159","""It was you,"" said I, ""that saved me again."""
"x159",""
"x159","""That depends.  You'll find this island an infernally rum place,"
"x159","I promise you.  I'd watch my goings carefully, if I were you."
"x159","_He_--"" He hesitated, and seemed to alter his mind about what"
"x159","was on his lips.  ""I wish you'd help me with these rabbits,"""
"x159","he said."
"x159",""
"x159","His procedure with the rabbits was singular.  I waded"
"x159","in with him, and helped him lug one of the hutches ashore."
"x159","No sooner was that done than he opened the door of it, and tilting"
"x159","the thing on one end turned its living contents out on the ground."
"x159","They fell in a struggling heap one on the top of the other."
"x159","He clapped his hands, and forthwith they went off with that hopping"
"x159","run of theirs, fifteen or twenty of them I should think, up"
"x159","the beach."
"x159",""
"x159","""Increase and multiply, my friends,"" said Montgomery."
"x159","""Replenish the island.  Hitherto we've had a certain lack of meat here."""

"x159","As I watched them disappearing, the white-haired man returned with a"
"x159","brandy-flask and some biscuits.  ""Something to go on with, Prendick,"""
"x159","said he, in a far more familiar tone than before.  I made no ado,"
"x159","but set to work on the biscuits at once, while the white-haired man"
"x159","helped Montgomery to release about a score more of the rabbits."
"x159","Three big hutches, however, went up to the house with the puma."

"x159","I noticed then that the puma in its cage and the pile of packages"

"x159","He twisted his heavy mouth into a faint smile--he was one of those"
"x159","saturnine people who smile with the corners of the mouth down,--and"
"x159","bowed his acknowledgment of my complaisance.  The main entrance"

"x159","the corner we came to a small doorway I had not previously observed."
"x159","The white-haired man produced a bundle of keys from the pocket"
"x159","of his greasy blue jacket, opened this door, and entered."
"x159","His keys, and the elaborate locking-up of the place even while it"
"x159","was still under his eye, struck me as peculiar.  I followed him,"
"x159","and found myself in a small apartment, plainly but not uncomfortably"
"x159","furnished and with its inner door, which was slightly ajar, opening into"
"x159","a paved courtyard.  This inner door Montgomery at once closed."
"x159","A hammock was slung across the darker corner of the room, and a"

"x159",""
"x159","This the white-haired man told me was to be my apartment;"
"x159","and the inner door, which ""for fear of accidents,"" he said,"
"x159","he would lock on the other side, was my limit inward."
"x159","He called my attention to a convenient deck-chair before the window,"
"x159","and to an array of old books, chiefly, I found, surgical works"
"x159","and editions of the Latin and Greek classics (languages I"
"x159","cannot read with any comfort), on a shelf near the hammock."
"x159","He left the room by the outer door, as if to avoid opening the inner"
"x159","one again."
"x159",""
"x159","""We usually have our meals in here,"" said Montgomery, and then,"
"x159","as if in doubt, went out after the other.  ""Moreau!"" I heard"

"x159","Then as I handled the books on the shelf it came up in consciousness:"
"x159","Where had I heard the name of Moreau before?  I sat down before"

"x159","Through the window I saw one of those unaccountable men in white, lugging a"
"x159","packing-case along the beach.  Presently the window-frame hid him."
"x159","Then I heard a key inserted and turned in the lock behind me."
"x159","After a little while I heard through the locked door the noise"
"x159","of the staghounds, that had now been brought up from the beach."
"x159","They were not barking, but sniffing and growling in a curious fashion."
"x159","I could hear the rapid patter of their feet, and Montgomery's voice"
"x159","soothing them."
"x159",""
"x159","I was very much impressed by the elaborate secrecy of these two men"
"x159","regarding the contents of the place, and for some time I was thinking"
"x159","of that and of the unaccountable familiarity of the name of Moreau;"
"x159","but so odd is the human memory that I could not then recall that"
"x159","well-known name in its proper connection.  From that my thoughts"
"x159","went to the indefinable queerness of the deformed man on the beach."
"x159","I never saw such a gait, such odd motions as he pulled at the box."
"x159","I recalled that none of these men had spoken to me, though most"
"x159","of them I had found looking at me at one time or another in a"
"x159","peculiarly furtive manner, quite unlike the frank stare of your"
"x159","unsophisticated savage.  Indeed, they had all seemed remarkably taciturn,"
"x159","and when they did speak, endowed with very uncanny voices."
"x159","What was wrong with them?  Then I recalled the eyes of Montgomery's"
"x159","ungainly attendant."
"x159",""
"x159","Just as I was thinking of him he came in.  He was now dressed in white,"
"x159","and carried a little tray with some coffee and boiled vegetables thereon."
"x159","I could hardly repress a shuddering recoil as he came, bending amiably,"
"x159","and placed the tray before me on the table.  Then astonishment"
"x159","paralysed me.  Under his stringy black locks I saw his ear;"
"x159","it jumped upon me suddenly close to my face.  The man had pointed ears,"
"x159","covered with a fine brown fur!"

"x159","""Your breakfast, sair,"" he said."

"x159","I stared at his face without attempting to answer him.  He turned"

"x159","I followed him out with my eyes; and as I did so, by some odd trick"
"x159","of unconscious cerebration, there came surging into my head the phrase,"
"x159","""The Moreau Hollows""--was it?  ""The Moreau--"" Ah!  It sent my memory"
"x159","back ten years.  ""The Moreau Horrors!""  The phrase drifted loose"
"x159","in my mind for a moment, and then I saw it in red lettering on a little"
"x159","buff-coloured pamphlet, to read which made one shiver and creep."
"x159","Then I remembered distinctly all about it.  That long-forgotten"
"x159","pamphlet came back with startling vividness to my mind."
"x159","I had been a mere lad then, and Moreau was, I suppose, about fifty,--a"
"x159","prominent and masterful physiologist, well-known in scientific"
"x159","circles for his extraordinary imagination and his brutal directness"
"x159","in discussion."
"x159",""
"x159","Was this the same Moreau?  He had published some very astonishing"
"x159","facts in connection with the transfusion of blood, and in"
"x159","addition was known to be doing valuable work on morbid growths."
"x159","Then suddenly his career was closed.  He had to leave England."
"x159","A journalist obtained access to his laboratory in the capacity"
"x159","of laboratory-assistant, with the deliberate intention of making"
"x159","sensational exposures; and by the help of a shocking accident"
"x159","(if it was an accident), his gruesome pamphlet became notorious."
"x159","On the day of its publication a wretched dog, flayed and"
"x159","otherwise mutilated, escaped from Moreau's house.  It was in"
"x159","the silly season, and a prominent editor, a cousin of the temporary"
"x159","laboratory-assistant, appealed to the conscience of the nation."
"x159","It was not the first time that conscience has turned against the methods"
"x159","of research.  The doctor was simply howled out of the country."
"x159","It may be that he deserved to be; but I still think that the tepid"
"x159","support of his fellow-investigators and his desertion by the great"
"x159","body of scientific workers was a shameful thing.  Yet some of"
"x159","his experiments, by the journalist's account, were wantonly cruel."
"x159","He might perhaps have purchased his social peace by abandoning"
"x159","his investigations; but he apparently preferred the latter, as most men"
"x159","would who have once fallen under the overmastering spell of research."
"x159","He was unmarried, and had indeed nothing but his own interest"
"x159","to consider."
"x159",""
"x159","I felt convinced that this must be the same man.  Everything pointed"
"x159","to it.  It dawned upon me to what end the puma and the other"
"x159","animals--which had now been brought with other luggage into the"
"x159","enclosure behind the house--were destined; and a curious faint odour,"
"x159","the halitus of something familiar, an odour that had been in"
"x159","the background of my consciousness hitherto, suddenly came forward"
"x159","into the forefront of my thoughts.  It was the antiseptic odour"
"x159","of the dissecting-room. I heard the puma growling through the wall,"
"x159","and one of the dogs yelped as though it had been struck."
"x159",""
"x159","Yet surely, and especially to another scientific man, there was"
"x159","nothing so horrible in vivisection as to account for this secrecy;"
"x159","and by some odd leap in my thoughts the pointed ears and luminous"
"x159","eyes of Montgomery's attendant came back again before me with"
"x159","the sharpest definition.  I stared before me out at the green sea,"
"x159","frothing under a freshening breeze, and let these and other strange"
"x159","memories of the last few days chase one another through my mind."

"x159",""
"x159",""
"x159","MONTGOMERY interrupted my tangle of mystification and suspicion"
"x159","about one o'clock, and his grotesque attendant followed him"
"x159","with a tray bearing bread, some herbs and other eatables,"
"x159","a flask of whiskey, a jug of water, and three glasses and knives."
"x159","I glanced askance at this strange creature, and found him watching"
"x159","me with his queer, restless eyes.  Montgomery said he would lunch"
"x159","with me, but that Moreau was too preoccupied with some work"
"x159","to come."
"x159",""
"x159","""Moreau!"" said I.  ""I know that name."""
"x159",""
"x159","""The devil you do!"" said he.  ""What an ass I was to mention it to you!"
"x159","I might have thought.  Anyhow, it will give you an inkling"
"x159","of our--mysteries.  Whiskey?"""
"x159",""
"x159","""No, thanks; I'm an abstainer."""
"x159",""
"x159","""I wish I'd been.  But it's no use locking the door"
"x159","after the steed is stolen.  It was that infernal"
"x159","stuff which led to my coming here,--that, and a foggy night."
"x159","I thought myself in luck at the time, when Moreau offered to get me off."
"x159","It's queer--"""
"x159",""
"x159","""Montgomery,"" said I, suddenly, as the outer door closed, ""why has"
"x159","your man pointed ears?"""
"x159",""
"x159","""Damn!"" he said, over his first mouthful of food.  He stared at me"
"x159","for a moment, and then repeated, ""Pointed ears?"""
"x159",""
"x159","""Little points to them,"" said I, as calmly as possible, with a catch"
"x159","in my breath; ""and a fine black fur at the edges?"""
"x159",""
"x159","He helped himself to whiskey and water with great deliberation."
"x159","""I was under the impression--that his hair covered his ears."""
"x159",""
"x159","""I saw them as he stooped by me to put that coffee you sent to me"
"x159","on the table.  And his eyes shine in the dark."""
"x159",""
"x159","By this time Montgomery had recovered from the surprise of my question."
"x159","""I always thought,"" he said deliberately, with a certain"
"x159","accentuation of his flavouring of lisp, ""that there _was_ something"
"x159","the matter with his ears, from the way he covered them."
"x159","What were they like?"""
"x159",""
"x159","I was persuaded from his manner that this ignorance was a pretence."
"x159","Still, I could hardly tell the man that I thought him a liar."
"x159","""Pointed,"" I said; ""rather small and furry,--distinctly furry."
"x159","But the whole man is one of the strangest beings I ever set"
"x159","eyes on."""
"x159",""
"x159","A sharp, hoarse cry of animal pain came from the enclosure behind us."
"x159","Its depth and volume testified to the puma.  I saw Montgomery wince."
"x159",""
"x159","""Yes?"" he said."
"x159",""
"x159","""Where did you pick up the creature?"""
"x159",""
"x159","""San Francisco.  He's an ugly brute, I admit.  Half-witted, you know."
"x159","Can't remember where he came from.  But I'm used to him, you know."
"x159","We both are.  How does he strike you?"""
"x159",""
"x159","""He's unnatural,"" I said.  ""There's something about him--don't"
"x159","think me fanciful, but it gives me a nasty little sensation,"
"x159","a tightening of my muscles, when he comes near me.  It's a touch--of"
"x159","the diabolical, in fact."""
"x159",""
"x159","Montgomery had stopped eating while I told him this.  ""Rum!"" he said."
"x159","""I can't see it.""  He resumed his meal.  ""I had no idea of it,"""
"x159","he said, and masticated.  ""The crew of the schooner must have"
"x159","felt it the same.  Made a dead set at the poor devil.  You saw"
"x159","the captain?"""
"x159",""
"x159","Suddenly the puma howled again, this time more painfully."
"x159","Montgomery swore under his breath.  I had half a mind to attack him"
"x159","about the men on the beach.  Then the poor brute within gave vent"
"x159","to a series of short, sharp cries."
"x159",""
"x159","""Your men on the beach,"" said I; ""what race are they?"""
"x159",""
"x159","""Excellent fellows, aren't they?"" said he, absentmindedly,"
"x159","knitting his brows as the animal yelled out sharply."
"x159",""
"x159","I said no more.  There was another outcry worse than the former."
"x159","He looked at me with his dull grey eyes, and then took some"
"x159","more whiskey.  He tried to draw me into a discussion about alcohol,"
"x159","professing to have saved my life with it.  He seemed anxious"
"x159","to lay stress on the fact that I owed my life to him.  I answered"
"x159","him distractedly."
"x159",""
"x159","Presently our meal came to an end; the misshapen monster with"
"x159","the pointed ears cleared the remains away, and Montgomery left"
"x159","me alone in the room again.  All the time he had been in a state"
"x159","of ill-concealed irritation at the noise of the vivisected puma."
"x159","He had spoken of his odd want of nerve, and left me to the"
"x159","obvious application."
"x159",""
"x159","I found myself that the cries were singularly irritating,"
"x159","and they grew in depth and intensity as the afternoon wore on."
"x159","They were painful at first, but their constant resurgence at last"
"x159","altogether upset my balance.  I flung aside a crib of Horace I"
"x159","had been reading, and began to clench my fists, to bite my lips,"
"x159","and to pace the room.  Presently I got to stopping my ears with"
"x159","my fingers."
"x159",""
"x159","The emotional appeal of those yells grew upon me steadily,"
"x159","grew at last to such an exquisite expression of suffering that I"
"x159","could stand it in that confined room no longer.  I stepped"
"x159","out of the door into the slumberous heat of the late afternoon,"
"x159","and walking past the main entrance--locked again, I noticed--turned"
"x159","the corner of the wall."
"x159",""
"x159","The crying sounded even louder out of doors.  It was as if all the pain"
"x159","in the world had found a voice.  Yet had I known such pain was in"
"x159","the next room, and had it been dumb, I believe--I have thought since--I"
"x159","could have stood it well enough.  It is when suffering finds a voice"
"x159","and sets our nerves quivering that this pity comes troubling us."
"x159","But in spite of the brilliant sunlight and the green fans of the trees"
"x159","waving in the soothing sea-breeze, the world was a confusion,"
"x159","blurred with drifting black and red phantasms, until I was out of earshot"

"x159","IX.  THE THING IN THE FOREST."
"x159",""
"x159",""
"x159","I STRODE through the undergrowth that clothed the ridge behind the house,"
"x159","scarcely heeding whither I went; passed on through the shadow of a thick"
"x159","cluster of straight-stemmed trees beyond it, and so presently found"
"x159","myself some way on the other side of the ridge, and descending towards"
"x159","a streamlet that ran through a narrow valley.  I paused and listened."
"x159","The distance I had come, or the intervening masses of thicket,"
"x159","deadened any sound that might be coming from the enclosure."
"x159","The air was still.  Then with a rustle a rabbit emerged, and went"
"x159","scampering up the slope before me.  I hesitated, and sat down in the edge"
"x159","of the shade."
"x159",""
"x159","The place was a pleasant one.  The rivulet was hidden"
"x159","by the luxuriant vegetation of the banks save at one point,"
"x159","where I caught a triangular patch of its glittering water."
"x159","On the farther side I saw through a bluish haze a tangle of trees"
"x159","and creepers, and above these again the luminous blue of the sky."
"x159","Here and there a splash of white or crimson marked the blooming of some"
"x159","trailing epiphyte.  I let my eyes wander over this scene for a while,"
"x159","and then began to turn over in my mind again the strange peculiarities"
"x159","of Montgomery's man.  But it was too hot to think elaborately,"
"x159","and presently I fell into a tranquil state midway between dozing"
"x159","and waking."
"x159",""
"x159","From this I was aroused, after I know not how long, by a"
"x159","rustling amidst the greenery on the other side of the stream."
"x159","For a moment I could see nothing but the waving summits of"
"x159","the ferns and reeds.  Then suddenly upon the bank of the stream"
"x159","appeared something--at first I could not distinguish what it was."
"x159","It bowed its round head to the water, and began to drink."
"x159","Then I saw it was a man, going on all-fours like a beast.  He was clothed"
"x159","in bluish cloth, and was of a copper-coloured hue, with black hair."
"x159","It seemed that grotesque ugliness was an invariable character of"
"x159","these islanders.  I could hear the suck of the water at his lips as"
"x159","he drank."
"x159",""
"x159","I leant forward to see him better, and a piece of lava, detached by"
"x159","my hand, went pattering down the slope.  He looked up guiltily,"
"x159","and his eyes met mine.  Forthwith he scrambled to his feet,"
"x159","and stood wiping his clumsy hand across his mouth and regarding me."
"x159","His legs were scarcely half the length of his body."
"x159","So, staring one another out of countenance, we remained for perhaps"
"x159","the space of a minute.  Then, stopping to look back once or twice,"
"x159","he slunk off among the bushes to the right of me, and I heard"
"x159","the swish of the fronds grow faint in the distance and die away."
"x159","Long after he had disappeared, I remained sitting up staring"
"x159","in the direction of his retreat.  My drowsy tranquillity"
"x159","had gone."
"x159",""
"x159","I was startled by a noise behind me, and turning suddenly saw"
"x159","the flapping white tail of a rabbit vanishing up the slope."
"x159","I jumped to my feet.  The apparition of this grotesque, half-bestial"
"x159","creature had suddenly populated the stillness of the afternoon for me."
"x159","I looked around me rather nervously, and regretted that I was unarmed."
"x159","Then I thought that the man I had just seen had been clothed"
"x159","in bluish cloth, had not been naked as a savage would have been;"
"x159","and I tried to persuade myself from that fact that he was after all"
"x159","probably a peaceful character, that the dull ferocity of his countenance"
"x159","belied him."
"x159",""
"x159","Yet I was greatly disturbed at the apparition.  I walked"
"x159","to the left along the slope, turning my head about and peering"
"x159","this way and that among the straight stems of the trees."
"x159","Why should a man go on all-fours and drink with his lips?  Presently I"
"x159","heard an animal wailing again, and taking it to be the puma, I turned"
"x159","about and walked in a direction diametrically opposite to the sound."
"x159","This led me down to the stream, across which I stepped and pushed"
"x159","my way up through the undergrowth beyond."
"x159",""
"x159","I was startled by a great patch of vivid scarlet on the ground,"
"x159","and going up to it found it to be a peculiar fungus, branched and"
"x159","corrugated like a foliaceous lichen, but deliquescing into slime"
"x159","at the touch; and then in the shadow of some luxuriant ferns I"
"x159","came upon an unpleasant thing,--the dead body of a rabbit covered"
"x159","with shining flies, but still warm and with the head torn off."
"x159","I stopped aghast at the sight of the scattered blood."
"x159","Here at least was one visitor to the island disposed of!"
"x159","There were no traces of other violence about it.  It looked as though it"
"x159","had been suddenly snatched up and killed; and as I stared at the little"
"x159","furry body came the difficulty of how the thing had been done."
"x159","The vague dread that had been in my mind since I had seen the inhuman"
"x159","face of the man at the stream grew distincter as I stood there."
"x159","I began to realise the hardihood of my expedition among these"
"x159","unknown people.  The thicket about me became altered to my imagination."
"x159","Every shadow became something more than a shadow,--became an ambush;"
"x159","every rustle became a threat.  Invisible things seemed watching me."
"x159","I resolved to go back to the enclosure on the beach.  I suddenly"
"x159","turned away and thrust myself violently, possibly even frantically,"
"x159","through the bushes, anxious to get a clear space about me"
"x159","again."
"x159",""
"x159","I stopped just in time to prevent myself emerging upon an open space."
"x159","It was a kind of glade in the forest, made by a fall; seedlings were"
"x159","already starting up to struggle for the vacant space; and beyond,"
"x159","the dense growth of stems and twining vines and splashes of fungus"
"x159","and flowers closed in again.  Before me, squatting together upon"
"x159","the fungoid ruins of a huge fallen tree and still unaware of my approach,"
"x159","were three grotesque human figures.  One was evidently a female;"
"x159","the other two were men.  They were naked, save for swathings"
"x159","of scarlet cloth about the middle; and their skins were of a dull"
"x159","pinkish-drab colour, such as I had seen in no savages before."
"x159","They had fat, heavy, chinless faces, retreating foreheads,"
"x159","and a scant bristly hair upon their heads.  I never saw such"
"x159","bestial-looking creatures."
"x159",""
"x159","They were talking, or at least one of the men was talking to the other two,"
"x159","and all three had been too closely interested to heed the rustling of"
"x159","my approach.  They swayed their heads and shoulders from side to side."
"x159","The speaker's words came thick and sloppy, and though I could"
"x159","hear them distinctly I could not distinguish what he said."
"x159","He seemed to me to be reciting some complicated gibberish."
"x159","Presently his articulation became shriller, and spreading his hands"
"x159","he rose to his feet.  At that the others began to gibber in unison,"
"x159","also rising to their feet, spreading their hands and swaying their"
"x159","bodies in rhythm with their chant.  I noticed then the abnormal"
"x159","shortness of their legs, and their lank, clumsy feet.  All three began"
"x159","slowly to circle round, raising and stamping their feet and waving"
"x159","their arms; a kind of tune crept into their rhythmic recitation,"
"x159","and a refrain,--""Aloola,"" or ""Balloola,"" it sounded like."
"x159","Their eyes began to sparkle, and their ugly faces to brighten,"
"x159","with an expression of strange pleasure.  Saliva dripped from their"
"x159","lipless mouths."
"x159",""
"x159","Suddenly, as I watched their grotesque and unaccountable gestures,"
"x159","I perceived clearly for the first time what it was that had offended me,"
"x159","what had given me the two inconsistent and conflicting impressions"
"x159","of utter strangeness and yet of the strangest familiarity."
"x159","The three creatures engaged in this mysterious rite were human in shape,"
"x159","and yet human beings with the strangest air about them of some"
"x159","familiar animal.  Each of these creatures, despite its human form,"
"x159","its rag of clothing, and the rough humanity of its bodily form,"
"x159","had woven into it--into its movements, into the expression of"
"x159","its countenance, into its whole presence--some now irresistible"
"x159","suggestion of a hog, a swinish taint, the unmistakable mark of"
"x159","the beast."
"x159",""
"x159","I stood overcome by this amazing realisation and then the most horrible"
"x159","questionings came rushing into my mind.  They began leaping in the air,"
"x159","first one and then the other, whooping and grunting.  Then one slipped,"
"x159","and for a moment was on all-fours,--to recover, indeed, forthwith."
"x159","But that transitory gleam of the true animalism of these monsters"
"x159","was enough."
"x159",""
"x159","I turned as noiselessly as possible, and becoming every now"
"x159","and then rigid with the fear of being discovered, as a branch"
"x159","cracked or a leaf rustled, I pushed back into the bushes."
"x159","It was long before I grew bolder, and dared to move freely."
"x159","My only idea for the moment was to get away from these foul beings, and I"
"x159","scarcely noticed that I had emerged upon a faint pathway amidst the trees."
"x159","Then suddenly traversing a little glade, I saw with an unpleasant start"
"x159","two clumsy legs among the trees, walking with noiseless footsteps"
"x159","parallel with my course, and perhaps thirty yards away from me."
"x159","The head and upper part of the body were hidden by a tangle of creeper."
"x159","I stopped abruptly, hoping the creature did not see me."
"x159","The feet stopped as I did.  So nervous was I that I controlled"
"x159","an impulse to headlong flight with the utmost difficulty."
"x159","Then looking hard, I distinguished through the interlacing network"
"x159","the head and body of the brute I had seen drinking.  He moved his head."
"x159","There was an emerald flash in his eyes as he glanced at me from"
"x159","the shadow of the trees, a half-luminous colour that vanished as"
"x159","he turned his head again.  He was motionless for a moment, and then"
"x159","with a noiseless tread began running through the green confusion."
"x159","In another moment he had vanished behind some bushes."
"x159","I could not see him, but I felt that he had stopped and was watching me"
"x159","again."
"x159",""
"x159","What on earth was he,--man or beast?  What did he want with me?"
"x159","I had no weapon, not even a stick.  Flight would be madness."
"x159","At any rate the Thing, whatever it was, lacked the courage to attack me."
"x159","Setting my teeth hard, I walked straight towards him."
"x159","I was anxious not to show the fear that seemed chilling my backbone."
"x159","I pushed through a tangle of tall white-flowered bushes,"
"x159","and saw him twenty paces beyond, looking over his shoulder at me"
"x159","and hesitating.  I advanced a step or two, looking steadfastly into"
"x159","his eyes."
"x159",""
"x159","""Who are you?"" said I."
"x159",""
"x159","He tried to meet my gaze.  ""No!"" he said suddenly, and turning went"
"x159","bounding away from me through the undergrowth.  Then he turned"
"x159","and stared at me again.  His eyes shone brightly out of the dusk"
"x159","under the trees."
"x159",""
"x159","My heart was in my mouth; but I felt my only chance was bluff,"
"x159","and walked steadily towards him.  He turned again, and vanished"
"x159","into the dusk.  Once more I thought I caught the glint of his eyes,"
"x159","and that was all."
"x159",""
"x159","For the first time I realised how the lateness of the hour"
"x159","might affect me.  The sun had set some minutes since, the swift"
"x159","dusk of the tropics was already fading out of the eastern sky,"
"x159","and a pioneer moth fluttered silently by my head.  Unless I would"
"x159","spend the night among the unknown dangers of the mysterious forest,"
"x159","I must hasten back to the enclosure.  The thought of a return"
"x159","to that pain-haunted refuge was extremely disagreeable, but still"
"x159","more so was the idea of being overtaken in the open by darkness"
"x159","and all that darkness might conceal.  I gave one more look"
"x159","into the blue shadows that had swallowed up this odd creature,"
"x159","and then retraced my way down the slope towards the stream,"
"x159","going as I judged in the direction from which I had come."
"x159",""
"x159","I walked eagerly, my mind confused with many things,"
"x159","and presently found myself in a level place among scattered trees."
"x159","The colourless clearness that comes after the sunset flush"
"x159","was darkling; the blue sky above grew momentarily deeper,"
"x159","and the little stars one by one pierced the attenuated light;"
"x159","the interspaces of the trees, the gaps in the further vegetation,"
"x159","that had been hazy blue in the daylight, grew black and mysterious."
"x159","I pushed on.  The colour vanished from the world."
"x159","The tree-tops rose against the luminous blue sky in inky silhouette,"
"x159","and all below that outline melted into one formless blackness."
"x159","Presently the trees grew thinner, and the shrubby undergrowth"
"x159","more abundant.  Then there was a desolate space covered with"
"x159","a white sand, and then another expanse of tangled bushes."
"x159","I did not remember crossing the sand-opening before."
"x159","I began to be tormented by a faint rustling upon my right hand."
"x159","I thought at first it was fancy, for whenever I stopped there"
"x159","was silence, save for the evening breeze in the tree-tops."
"x159","Then when I turned to hurry on again there was an echo to"
"x159","my footsteps."
"x159",""
"x159","I turned away from the thickets, keeping to the more open ground,"
"x159","and endeavouring by sudden turns now and then to surprise something"
"x159","in the act of creeping upon me.  I saw nothing, and nevertheless"
"x159","my sense of another presence grew steadily.  I increased my pace,"
"x159","and after some time came to a slight ridge, crossed it, and turned sharply,"
"x159","regarding it steadfastly from the further side.  It came out black"
"x159","and clear-cut against the darkling sky; and presently a shapeless"
"x159","lump heaved up momentarily against the sky-line and vanished again."
"x159","I felt assured now that my tawny-faced antagonist was stalking me"
"x159","once more; and coupled with that was another unpleasant realisation,"
"x159","that I had lost my way."
"x159",""
"x159","For a time I hurried on hopelessly perplexed, and pursued by that"
"x159","stealthy approach.  Whatever it was, the Thing either lacked the courage"
"x159","to attack me, or it was waiting to take me at some disadvantage."
"x159","I kept studiously to the open.  At times I would turn and listen;"
"x159","and presently I had half persuaded myself that my pursuer had abandoned"
"x159","the chase, or was a mere creation of my disordered imagination."
"x159","Then I heard the sound of the sea.  I quickened my footsteps"
"x159","almost into a run, and immediately there was a stumble in"
"x159","my rear."
"x159",""
"x159","I turned suddenly, and stared at the uncertain trees behind me."
"x159","One black shadow seemed to leap into another.  I listened,"
"x159","rigid, and heard nothing but the creep of the blood in my ears."
"x159","I thought that my nerves were unstrung, and that my imagination"
"x159","was tricking me, and turned resolutely towards the sound of the"
"x159","sea again."
"x159",""
"x159","In a minute or so the trees grew thinner, and I emerged upon"
"x159","a bare, low headland running out into the sombre water."
"x159","The night was calm and clear, and the reflection of the growing"
"x159","multitude of the stars shivered in the tranquil heaving of the sea."
"x159","Some way out, the wash upon an irregular band of reef shone"
"x159","with a pallid light of its own.  Westward I saw the zodiacal"
"x159","light mingling with the yellow brilliance of the evening star."
"x159","The coast fell away from me to the east, and westward it was hidden"
"x159","by the shoulder of the cape.  Then I recalled the fact that Moreau's"
"x159","beach lay to the west."
"x159",""
"x159","A twig snapped behind me, and there was a rustle.  I turned, and stood"
"x159","facing the dark trees.  I could see nothing--or else I could see too much."
"x159","Every dark form in the dimness had its ominous quality, its peculiar"
"x159","suggestion of alert watchfulness.  So I stood for perhaps a minute,"
"x159","and then, with an eye to the trees still, turned westward to cross"
"x159","the headland; and as I moved, one among the lurking shadows moved"
"x159","to follow me."
"x159",""
"x159","My heart beat quickly.  Presently the broad sweep of a bay"
"x159","to the westward became visible, and I halted again."
"x159","The noiseless shadow halted a dozen yards from me."
"x159","A little point of light shone on the further bend of the curve,"
"x159","and the grey sweep of the sandy beach lay faint under the starlight."
"x159","Perhaps two miles away was that little point of light."
"x159","To get to the beach I should have to go through the trees where the"
"x159","shadows lurked, and down a bushy slope."
"x159",""
"x159","I could see the Thing rather more distinctly now.  It was no animal,"
"x159","for it stood erect.  At that I opened my mouth to speak, and found"
"x159","a hoarse phlegm choked my voice.  I tried again, and shouted,"
"x159","""Who is there?""  There was no answer.  I advanced a step."
"x159","The Thing did not move, only gathered itself together.  My foot"
"x159","struck a stone.  That gave me an idea.  Without taking my eyes off"
"x159","the black form before me, I stooped and picked up this lump of rock;"
"x159","but at my motion the Thing turned abruptly as a dog might have done,"
"x159","and slunk obliquely into the further darkness.  Then I recalled"
"x159","a schoolboy expedient against big dogs, and twisted the rock into"
"x159","my handkerchief, and gave this a turn round my wrist.  I heard a movement"
"x159","further off among the shadows, as if the Thing was in retreat."
"x159","Then suddenly my tense excitement gave way; I broke into a profuse"
"x159","perspiration and fell a-trembling, with my adversary routed and this"
"x159","weapon in my hand."
"x159",""
"x159","It was some time before I could summon resolution to go down through"
"x159","the trees and bushes upon the flank of the headland to the beach."
"x159","At last I did it at a run; and as I emerged from the thicket"
"x159","upon the sand, I heard some other body come crashing after me."
"x159","At that I completely lost my head with fear, and began running"
"x159","along the sand.  Forthwith there came the swift patter of soft"
"x159","feet in pursuit.  I gave a wild cry, and redoubled my pace."
"x159","Some dim, black things about three or four times the size of rabbits"
"x159","went running or hopping up from the beach towards the bushes as"
"x159","I passed."
"x159",""
"x159","So long as I live, I shall remember the terror of that chase."
"x159","I ran near the water's edge, and heard every now and then the splash"
"x159","of the feet that gained upon me.  Far away, hopelessly far,"
"x159","was the yellow light.  All the night about us was black and still."
"x159","Splash, splash, came the pursuing feet, nearer and nearer."
"x159","I felt my breath going, for I was quite out of training; it whooped"
"x159","as I drew it, and I felt a pain like a knife at my side.  I perceived"
"x159","the Thing would come up with me long before I reached the enclosure,"
"x159","and, desperate and sobbing for my breath, I wheeled round upon it"
"x159","and struck at it as it came up to me,--struck with all my strength."
"x159","The stone came out of the sling of the handkerchief as I did so."
"x159","As I turned, the Thing, which had been running on all-fours,"
"x159","rose to its feet, and the missile fell fair on its left temple."
"x159","The skull rang loud, and the animal-man blundered into me,"
"x159","thrust me back with its hands, and went staggering past me to fall"
"x159","headlong upon the sand with its face in the water; and there it lay"
"x159","still."
"x159",""
"x159","I could not bring myself to approach that black heap.  I left"
"x159","it there, with the water rippling round it, under the still stars,"
"x159","and giving it a wide berth pursued my way towards the yellow glow"
"x159","of the house; and presently, with a positive effect of relief,"
"x159","came the pitiful moaning of the puma, the sound that had"
"x159","originally driven me out to explore this mysterious island."
"x159","At that, though I was faint and horribly fatigued, I gathered"
"x159","together all my strength, and began running again towards the light."

"x159","After about an hour I heard Montgomery shouting my name,"
"x159","far away to the north.  That set me thinking of my plan of action."

"x159","vivisectors and their animalised victims.  Some of these no doubt"
"x159","they could press into their service against me if need arose."
"x159","I knew both Moreau and Montgomery carried revolvers; and, save for a feeble"
"x159","bar of deal spiked with a small nail, the merest mockery of a mace,"
"x159","I was unarmed."
"x159",""
"x159","So I lay still there, until I began to think of food and drink;"
"x159","and at that thought the real hopelessness of my position came home to me."
"x159","I knew no way of getting anything to eat.  I was too ignorant of botany"
"x159","to discover any resort of root or fruit that might lie about me;"
"x159","I had no means of trapping the few rabbits upon the island."
"x159","It grew blanker the more I turned the prospect over.  At last in"
"x159","the desperation of my position, my mind turned to the animal men I"

"x159","In turn I recalled each one I had seen, and tried to draw some augury"

"x159","I took little time to think, or they would have caught me then,"

"x159","towards the sound of the sea.  I remember a growth of thorny plants,"
"x159","with spines that stabbed like pen-knives. I emerged bleeding and"
"x159","with torn clothes upon the lip of a long creek opening northward."
"x159","I went straight into the water without a minute's hesitation, wading up"
"x159","the creek, and presently finding myself kneedeep in a little stream."

"x159","stem of a palm-tree. I gripped my stick, and stood up facing him."

"x159","It was purely an experiment.  It was a limbless thing, with a"
"x159","horrible face, that writhed along the ground in a serpentine fashion."
"x159","It was immensely strong, and in infuriating pain.  It lurked in"
"x159","the woods for some days, until we hunted it; and then it wriggled"
"x159","into the northern part of the island, and we divided the party"
"x159","to close in upon it.  Montgomery insisted upon coming with me."
"x159","The man had a rifle; and when his body was found, one of the barrels"
"x159","was curved into the shape of an S and very nearly bitten through."
"x159","Montgomery shot the thing.  After that I stuck to the ideal of"
"x159","humanity--except for little things."""

"x159","I fall short of the things I dream.  The human shape I can get now,"
"x159","almost with ease, so that it is lithe and graceful, or thick and strong;"
"x159","but often there is trouble with the hands and the claws,--painful things,"
"x159","that I dare not shape too freely.  But it is in the subtle grafting"

"x159","of the emotions.  Cravings, instincts, desires that harm humanity,"
"x159","a strange hidden reservoir to burst forth suddenly and inundate"
"x159","the whole being of the creature with anger, hate, or fear."
"x159","These creatures of mine seemed strange and uncanny to you so soon"

"x159","observe them, that the persuasion fades.  First one animal trait,"
"x159","then another, creeps to the surface and stares out at me."

"x159","about it, for he interferes in their affairs.  He has trained one"
"x159","or two of them to our service.  He's ashamed of it, but I believe"
"x159","he half likes some of those beasts.  It's his business, not mine."
"x159","They only sicken me with a sense of failure.  I take no interest in them."

"x159",""
"x159",""
"x159","I WOKE early.  Moreau's explanation stood before my mind,"
"x159","clear and definite, from the moment of my awakening.  I got out"
"x159","of the hammock and went to the door to assure myself that the key"
"x159","was turned.  Then I tried the window-bar, and found it firmly fixed."
"x159","That these man-like creatures were in truth only bestial monsters,"
"x159","mere grotesque travesties of men, filled me with a vague uncertainty"
"x159","of their possibilities which was far worse than any definite fear."
"x159",""
"x159","A tapping came at the door, and I heard the glutinous accents"
"x159","of M'ling speaking.  I pocketed one of the revolvers (keeping one"
"x159","hand upon it), and opened to him."
"x159",""
"x159","""Good-morning, sair,"" he said, bringing in, in addition to the customary"
"x159","herb-breakfast, an ill-cooked rabbit.  Montgomery followed him."
"x159","His roving eye caught the position of my arm and he smiled askew."
"x159",""
"x159","The puma was resting to heal that day; but Moreau, who was singularly"
"x159","solitary in his habits, did not join us.  I talked with Montgomery"
"x159","to clear my ideas of the way in which the Beast Folk lived."
"x159","In particular, I was urgent to know how these inhuman monsters were kept"
"x159","from falling upon Moreau and Montgomery and from rending one another."
"x159","He explained to me that the comparative safety of Moreau and"
"x159","himself was due to the limited mental scope of these monsters."
"x159","In spite of their increased intelligence and the tendency of their"
"x159","animal instincts to reawaken, they had certain fixed ideas implanted"
"x159","by Moreau in their minds, which absolutely bounded their imaginations."
"x159","They were really hypnotised; had been told that certain things"
"x159","were impossible, and that certain things were not to be done,"
"x159","and these prohibitions were woven into the texture of their minds beyond"
"x159","any possibility of disobedience or dispute."
"x159",""
"x159","Certain matters, however, in which old instinct was at war"
"x159","with Moreau's convenience, were in a less stable condition."
"x159","A series of propositions called the Law (I had already heard them recited)"
"x159","battled in their minds with the deep-seated, ever-rebellious cravings"
"x159","of their animal natures.  This Law they were ever repeating,"
"x159","I found, and ever breaking.  Both Montgomery and Moreau displayed"
"x159","particular solicitude to keep them ignorant of the taste of blood;"
"x159","they feared the inevitable suggestions of that flavour."
"x159","Montgomery told me that the Law, especially among the feline Beast People,"
"x159","became oddly weakened about nightfall; that then the animal was at"
"x159","its strongest; that a spirit of adventure sprang up in them at the dusk,"
"x159","when they would dare things they never seemed to dream about by day."
"x159","To that I owed my stalking by the Leopard-man, on the night of my arrival."
"x159","But during these earlier days of my stay they broke the Law only"
"x159","furtively and after dark; in the daylight there was a general"
"x159","atmosphere of respect for its multifarious prohibitions."
"x159",""
"x159","And here perhaps I may give a few general facts about the island"
"x159","and the Beast People.  The island, which was of irregular outline"
"x159","and lay low upon the wide sea, had a total area, I suppose,"
"x159","of seven or eight square miles.{2} It was volcanic in origin,"
"x159","and was now fringed on three sides by coral reefs; some fumaroles"
"x159","to the northward, and a hot spring, were the only vestiges of"
"x159","the forces that had long since originated it.  Now and then a faint"
"x159","quiver of earthquake would be sensible, and sometimes the ascent"
"x159","of the spire of smoke would be rendered tumultuous by gusts of steam;"
"x159","but that was all.  The population of the island, Montgomery informed me,"
"x159","now numbered rather more than sixty of these strange creations"
"x159","of Moreau's art, not counting the smaller monstrosities"
"x159","which lived in the undergrowth and were without human form."
"x159","Altogether he had made nearly a hundred and twenty; but many had died,"
"x159","and others--like the writhing Footless Thing of which he had told"
"x159","me--had come by violent ends.  In answer to my question, Montgomery"
"x159","said that they actually bore offspring, but that these generally died."
"x159","When they lived, Moreau took them and stamped the human form upon them."
"x159","There was no evidence of the inheritance of their acquired"
"x159","human characteristics.  The females were less numerous than the males,"
"x159","and liable to much furtive persecution in spite of the monogamy the"
"x159","Law enjoined."
"x159",""
"x159","     {2} This description corresponds in every respect to Noble's Isle."
"x159","         -- C. E. P."
"x159",""
"x159","It would be impossible for me to describe these Beast People in detail;"
"x159","my eye has had no training in details, and unhappily I cannot sketch."
"x159","Most striking, perhaps, in their general appearance was the"
"x159","disproportion between the legs of these creatures and the length"
"x159","of their bodies; and yet--so relative is our idea of grace--my"
"x159","eye became habituated to their forms, and at last I even fell"
"x159","in with their persuasion that my own long thighs were ungainly."
"x159","Another point was the forward carriage of the head and the clumsy"
"x159","and inhuman curvature of the spine.  Even the Ape-man lacked"
"x159","that inward sinuous curve of the back which makes the human"
"x159","figure so graceful.  Most had their shoulders hunched clumsily,"
"x159","and their short forearms hung weakly at their sides.  Few of them"
"x159","were conspicuously hairy, at least until the end of my time upon"
"x159","the island."
"x159",""
"x159","The next most obvious deformity was in their faces,"
"x159","almost all of which were prognathous, malformed about the ears,"
"x159","with large and protuberant noses, very furry or very bristly hair,"
"x159","and often strangely-coloured or strangely-placed eyes."
"x159","None could laugh, though the Ape-man had a chattering titter."
"x159","Beyond these general characters their heads had little in common;"
"x159","each preserved the quality of its particular species:"
"x159","the human mark distorted but did not hide the leopard, the ox,"
"x159","or the sow, or other animal or animals, from which the creature"
"x159","had been moulded.  The voices, too, varied exceedingly."
"x159","The hands were always malformed; and though some surprised me by their"
"x159","unexpected human appearance, almost all were deficient in the number"
"x159","of the digits, clumsy about the finger-nails, and lacking any"
"x159","tactile sensibility."
"x159",""
"x159","The two most formidable Animal Men were my Leopard-man and a creature"
"x159","made of hyena and swine.  Larger than these were the three bull-creatures"
"x159","who pulled in the boat.  Then came the silvery-hairy-man, who was also"
"x159","the Sayer of the Law, M'ling, and a satyr-like creature of ape and goat."
"x159","There were three Swine-men and a Swine-woman, a mare-rhinoceros-creature,"
"x159","and several other females whose sources I did not ascertain."
"x159","There were several wolf-creatures, a bear-bull, and a Saint-Bernard-man. I"
"x159","have already described the Ape-man, and there was a particularly hateful"
"x159","(and evil-smelling) old woman made of vixen and bear, whom I hated"
"x159","from the beginning.  She was said to be a passionate votary of the Law."
"x159","Smaller creatures were certain dappled youths and my little"
"x159","sloth-creature. But enough of this catalogue."
"x159",""
"x159","At first I had a shivering horror of the brutes, felt all too keenly"
"x159","that they were still brutes; but insensibly I became a little"
"x159","habituated to the idea of them, and moreover I was affected by"
"x159","Montgomery's attitude towards them.  He had been with them so long"
"x159","that he had come to regard them as almost normal human beings."
"x159","His London days seemed a glorious, impossible past to him."
"x159","Only once in a year or so did he go to Arica to deal with"
"x159","Moreau's agent, a trader in animals there.  He hardly met the finest"
"x159","type of mankind in that seafaring village of Spanish mongrels."
"x159","The men aboard-ship, he told me, seemed at first just as strange"
"x159","to him as the Beast Men seemed to me,--unnaturally long in the leg,"
"x159","flat in the face, prominent in the forehead, suspicious, dangerous,"
"x159","and cold-hearted. In fact, he did not like men:  his heart"
"x159","had warmed to me, he thought, because he had saved my life."
"x159","I fancied even then that he had a sneaking kindness for some of these"
"x159","metamorphosed brutes, a vicious sympathy with some of their ways,"
"x159","but that he attempted to veil it from me at first."
"x159",""
"x159","M'ling, the black-faced man, Montgomery's attendant, the first of"
"x159","the Beast Folk I had encountered, did not live with the others across"
"x159","the island, but in a small kennel at the back of the enclosure."
"x159","The creature was scarcely so intelligent as the Ape-man, but far"
"x159","more docile, and the most human-looking of all the Beast Folk;"
"x159","and Montgomery had trained it to prepare food, and indeed to"
"x159","discharge all the trivial domestic offices that were required."
"x159","It was a complex trophy of Moreau's horrible skill,--a bear, tainted with"
"x159","dog and ox, and one of the most elaborately made of all his creatures."
"x159","It treated Montgomery with a strange tenderness and devotion."
"x159","Sometimes he would notice it, pat it, call it half-mocking, half-jocular"
"x159","names, and so make it caper with extraordinary delight; sometimes he"
"x159","would ill-treat it, especially after he had been at the whiskey,"
"x159","kicking it, beating it, pelting it with stones or lighted fusees."
"x159","But whether he treated it well or ill, it loved nothing so much as to be"
"x159","near him."
"x159",""
"x159","I say I became habituated to the Beast People, that a thousand"
"x159","things which had seemed unnatural and repulsive speedily became"
"x159","natural and ordinary to me.  I suppose everything in existence"
"x159","takes its colour from the average hue of our surroundings."
"x159","Montgomery and Moreau were too peculiar and individual"
"x159","to keep my general impressions of humanity well defined."
"x159","I would see one of the clumsy bovine-creatures who worked the launch"
"x159","treading heavily through the undergrowth, and find myself asking,"
"x159","trying hard to recall, how he differed from some really human"
"x159","yokel trudging home from his mechanical labours; or I would meet"
"x159","the Fox-bear woman's vulpine, shifty face, strangely human in its"
"x159","speculative cunning, and even imagine I had met it before in some"
"x159","city byway."
"x159",""
"x159","Yet every now and then the beast would flash out upon me beyond"
"x159","doubt or denial.  An ugly-looking man, a hunch-backed human savage"
"x159","to all appearance, squatting in the aperture of one of the dens,"
"x159","would stretch his arms and yawn, showing with startling suddenness"
"x159","scissor-edged incisors and sabre-like canines, keen and brilliant"
"x159","as knives.  Or in some narrow pathway, glancing with a transitory"
"x159","daring into the eyes of some lithe, white-swathed female figure,"
"x159","I would suddenly see (with a spasmodic revulsion) that she had"
"x159","slit-like pupils, or glancing down note the curving nail with which"
"x159","she held her shapeless wrap about her.  It is a curious thing, by"
"x159","the bye, for which I am quite unable to account, that these weird"
"x159","creatures--the females, I mean--had in the earlier days of my stay an"
"x159","instinctive sense of their own repulsive clumsiness, and displayed"

"x159","After I had breakfasted with Montgomery, he took me across"
"x159","the island to see the fumarole and the source of the hot spring"
"x159","into whose scalding waters I had blundered on the previous day."
"x159","Both of us carried whips and loaded revolvers.  While going through"
"x159","a leafy jungle on our road thither, we heard a rabbit squealing."
"x159","We stopped and listened, but we heard no more; and presently we"
"x159","went on our way, and the incident dropped out of our minds."
"x159","Montgomery called my attention to certain little pink animals"
"x159","with long hind-legs, that went leaping through the undergrowth."
"x159","He told me they were creatures made of the offspring of the Beast People,"
"x159","that Moreau had invented.  He had fancied they might serve for meat,"
"x159","but a rabbit-like habit of devouring their young had defeated"
"x159","this intention.  I had already encountered some of these"

"x159","It seemed to me rather a pretty little creature; and as Montgomery stated"

"x159","the exultation of hunting.  We burst out again among rocks,"

"x159","at us over his shoulder.  At that the Wolf Folk howled with delight."
"x159","The Thing was still clothed, and at a distance its face still seemed human;"
"x159","but the carriage of its four limbs was feline, and the furtive"
"x159","droop of its shoulder was distinctly that of a hunted animal."

"x159","At last the fury of the hunt slackened.  We had pinned the wretched"
"x159","brute into a corner of the island.  Moreau, whip in hand, marshalled us"
"x159","all into an irregular line, and we advanced now slowly, shouting to one"
"x159","another as we advanced and tightening the cordon about our victim."

"x159","""Confound you, Prendick!"" said Moreau.  ""I wanted him."""

"x159","I went to the headland and watched the bull-men, black against"
"x159","the evening sky as they carried the weighted dead body out to sea;"
"x159","and like a wave across my mind came the realisation of the unspeakable"

"x159","the rocks beneath me were the Ape-man, the Hyena-swine, and several"
"x159","other of the Beast People, standing about Montgomery and Moreau."

"x159","expressions of their loyalty to the Law; yet I felt an absolute"

"x159","in the rabbit-killing. A strange persuasion came upon me, that,"
"x159","save for the grossness of the line, the grotesqueness of the forms,"
"x159","I had here before me the whole balance of human life in miniature,"
"x159","the whole interplay of instinct, reason, and fate in its simplest form."

"x159","been beasts, their instincts fitly adapted to their surroundings,"
"x159","and happy as living things may be.  Now they stumbled in the shackles"
"x159","of humanity, lived in a fear that never died, fretted by a law they"
"x159","could not understand; their mock-human existence, begun in an agony,"

"x159","Had Moreau had any intelligible object, I could have sympathised at"
"x159","least a little with him.  I am not so squeamish about pain as that."

"x159","his mad, aimless investigations, drove him on; and the Things were"
"x159","thrown out to live a year or so, to struggle and blunder and suffer,"

"x159","the old animal hate moved them to trouble one another; the Law held"
"x159","them back from a brief hot struggle and a decisive end to their"
"x159","natural animosities."

"x159","In those days my fear of the Beast People went the way of my personal"

"x159","red drops starting out upon it, and the lidless eyes ablaze."

"x159","me headlong with a broken forearm; and the great monster,"
"x159","swathed in lint and with red-stained bandages fluttering about it,"
"x159","leapt over me and passed.  I rolled over and over down the beach,"
"x159","tried to sit up, and collapsed upon my broken arm.  Then Moreau appeared,"
"x159","his massive white face all the more terrible for the blood that"
"x159","trickled from his forehead.  He carried a revolver in one hand."
"x159","He scarcely glanced at me, but rushed off at once in pursuit of"
"x159","the puma."
"x159",""
"x159","I tried the other arm and sat up.  The muffled figure in front ran"
"x159","in great striding leaps along the beach, and Moreau followed her."

"x159","plunge into them, and Moreau, running slantingly to intercept her,"
"x159","fired and missed as she disappeared.  Then he too vanished"
"x159","in the green confusion.  I stared after them, and then the pain"
"x159","in my arm flamed up, and with a groan I staggered to my feet."

"x159","nothing of the puma affair; had been felling wood, and heard him calling."
"x159","They went on shouting together.  Two Beast Men came crouching"
"x159","and peering at them through the undergrowth, with gestures and a"
"x159","furtive carriage that alarmed Montgomery by their strangeness."
"x159","He hailed them, and they fled guiltily.  He stopped shouting"

"x159","and intensely excited.  They came crashing through the ferns,"
"x159","and stopped with fierce faces when they saw him.  He cracked his whip"
"x159","in some trepidation, and forthwith they rushed at him.  Never before"

"x159","rushed into a thicket and driven out an under-sized Ocelot-man,"
"x159","also blood-stained, and lame through a wound in the foot."
"x159","This brute had run a little way and then turned savagely at bay,"

"x159","The peaceful splendour of the night healed again."
"x159","The moon was now past the meridian and travelling down the west."
"x159","It was at its full, and very bright riding through the empty blue sky."
"x159","The shadow of the wall lay, a yard wide and of inky blackness, at my feet."
"x159","The eastward sea was a featureless grey, dark and mysterious;"
"x159","and between the sea and the shadow the grey sands (of volcanic"

"x159","after his terrible death, and with the hard eyes open, staring at"
"x159","the dead white moon above.  I sat down upon the edge of the sink,"
"x159","and with my eyes upon that ghastly pile of silvery light and ominous"
"x159","shadows began to turn over my plans.  In the morning I would gather"
"x159","some provisions in the dingey, and after setting fire to the pyre"
"x159","before me, push out into the desolation of the high sea once more."
"x159","I felt that for Montgomery there was no help; that he was, in truth,"
"x159","half akin to these Beast Folk, unfitted for human kindred."

"x159","I do not know how long I sat there scheming.  It must have been"
"x159","an hour or so.  Then my planning was interrupted by the return of"
"x159","Montgomery to my neighbourhood.  I heard a yelling from many throats,"
"x159","a tumult of exultant cries passing down towards the beach,"
"x159","whooping and howling, and excited shrieks that seemed to come to a stop"
"x159","near the water's edge.  The riot rose and fell; I heard heavy blows"
"x159","and the splintering smash of wood, but it did not trouble me then."
"x159","A discordant chanting began."

"x159","My thoughts went back to my means of escape.  I got up, brought the lamp,"

"x159","opened one.  I saw something out of the tail of my eye,--a red"

"x159","Behind me lay the yard, vividly black-and-white in the moonlight,"
"x159","and the pile of wood and faggots on which Moreau and his mutilated"
"x159","victims lay, one over another.  They seemed to be gripping one another"
"x159","in one last revengeful grapple.  His wounds gaped, black as night,"
"x159","and the blood that had dripped lay in black patches upon the sand."
"x159","Then I saw, without understanding, the cause of my phantom,--a"
"x159","ruddy glow that came and danced and went upon the wall opposite."
"x159","I misinterpreted this, fancied it was a reflection of my"
"x159","flickering lamp, and turned again to the stores in the shed."
"x159","I went on rummaging among them, as well as a one-armed man could,"
"x159","finding this convenient thing and that, and putting them"
"x159","aside for to-morrow's launch.  My movements were slow,"

"x159","The quality of the sounds changed so greatly that it arrested"

"x159","I began to run at once towards this fire, revolver in hand.  I saw the pink"
"x159","tongue of Montgomery's pistol lick out once, close to the ground."
"x159","He was down.  I shouted with all my strength and fired into the air."

"x159","with a bearded grey face--lay, I found, with the fore part of its"

"x159","so dreadfully that in mercy I blew its brains out at once."
"x159","The other brute was one of the Bull-men swathed in white."

"x159","Suddenly I heard a thud and a hissing behind me, and, looking round,"
"x159","sprang to my feet with a cry of horror.  Against the warm dawn"
"x159","great tumultuous masses of black smoke were boiling up out of"
"x159","the enclosure, and through their stormy darkness shot flickering"
"x159","threads of blood-red flame.  Then the thatched roof caught."
"x159","I saw the curving charge of the flames across the sloping straw."
"x159","A spurt of fire jetted from the window of my room."

"x159","The hopelessness of saving any of the contents of the enclosure"

"x159","chips and splinters were scattered broadcast, and the ashes"
"x159","of the bonfire were blackening and smoking under the dawn."

"x159","""Sorry,"" he said presently, with an effort.  He seemed trying to think."
"x159","""The last,"" he murmured, ""the last of this silly universe."
"x159","What a mess--"""
"x159",""
"x159","I listened.  His head fell helplessly to one side.  I thought some drink"

"x159","bring drink at hand.  He seemed suddenly heavier.  My heart went cold."
"x159","I bent down to his face, put my hand through the rent in his blouse."
"x159","He was dead; and even as he died a line of white heat, the limb"
"x159","of the sun, rose eastward beyond the projection of the bay,"
"x159","splashing its radiance across the sky and turning the dark sea into"
"x159","a weltering tumult of dazzling light.  It fell like a glory upon his"

"x159","I let his head fall gently upon the rough pillow I had made for him,"

"x159","""They are mad; they are fools,"" said the Dog-man.  ""Even now they"
"x159","talk together beyond there.  They say, 'The Master is dead."
"x159","The Other with the Whip is dead.  That Other who walked in the Sea is"
"x159","as we are.  We have no Master, no Whips, no House of Pain, any more."
"x159","There is an end.  We love the Law, and will keep it; but there"
"x159","is no Pain, no Master, no Whips for ever again.'  So they say."
"x159","But I know, Master, I know."""
"x159",""
"x159","I felt in the darkness, and patted the Dog-man's head.  ""It is well,"""
"x159","I said again."
"x159",""
"x159","""Presently you will slay them all,"" said the Dog-man."
"x159",""
"x159","""Presently,"" I answered, ""I will slay them all,--after certain"
"x159","days and certain things have come to pass.  Every one of them save"
"x159","those you spare, every one of them shall be slain."""

"x159","""What the Master wishes to kill, the Master kills,"" said the Dog-man"
"x159","with a certain satisfaction in his voice."

"x159","""And that their sins may grow,"" I said, ""let them live in their folly"
"x159","until their time is ripe.  Let them not know that I am the Master."""
"x159",""
"x159","""The Master's will is sweet,"" said the Dog-man, with the ready tact"
"x159","of his canine blood."
"x159",""
"x159","""But one has sinned,"" said I. ""Him I will kill, whenever I may meet him."
"x159","When I say to you, 'That is he,' see that you fall upon him."
"x159","And now I will go to the men and women who are assembled together."""
"x159",""
"x159","For a moment the opening of the hut was blackened by the exit of"
"x159","the Dog-man. Then I followed and stood up, almost in the exact spot"
"x159","where I had been when I had heard Moreau and his staghound pursuing me."
"x159","But now it was night, and all the miasmatic ravine about me was black;"
"x159","and beyond, instead of a green, sunlit slope, I saw a red fire,"
"x159","before which hunched, grotesque figures moved to and fro."
"x159","Farther were the thick trees, a bank of darkness, fringed above"
"x159","with the black lace of the upper branches.  The moon was just riding"
"x159","up on the edge of the ravine, and like a bar across its face drove"
"x159","the spire of vapour that was for ever streaming from the fumaroles of"
"x159","the island."
"x159",""
"x159","""Walk by me,"" said I, nerving myself; and side by side we walked"
"x159","down the narrow way, taking little heed of the dim Things that peered"
"x159","at us out of the huts."
"x159",""
"x159","None about the fire attempted to salute me.  Most of them"
"x159","disregarded me, ostentatiously.  I looked round for the Hyena-swine,"
"x159","but he was not there.  Altogether, perhaps twenty of the Beast"
"x159","Folk squatted, staring into the fire or talking to one another."
"x159",""
"x159","""He is dead, he is dead! the Master is dead!"" said the voice"
"x159","of the Ape-man to the right of me.  ""The House of Pain--there"
"x159","is no House of Pain!"""
"x159",""
"x159","""He is not dead,"" said I, in a loud voice.  ""Even now he watches us!"""
"x159",""
"x159","This startled them.  Twenty pairs of eyes regarded me."
"x159",""
"x159","""The House of Pain is gone,"" said I. ""It will come again."
"x159","The Master you cannot see; yet even now he listens among you."""
"x159",""
"x159","""True, true!"" said the Dog-man."
"x159",""
"x159","They were staggered at my assurance.  An animal may be ferocious"
"x159","and cunning enough, but it takes a real man to tell a lie."
"x159",""
"x159","""The Man with the Bandaged Arm speaks a strange thing,"""
"x159","said one of the Beast Folk."
"x159",""
"x159","""I tell you it is so,"" I said.  ""The Master and the House of Pain"
"x159","will come again.  Woe be to him who breaks the Law!"""
"x159",""
"x159","They looked curiously at one another.  With an affectation of indifference"
"x159","I began to chop idly at the ground in front of me with my hatchet."
"x159","They looked, I noticed, at the deep cuts I made in the turf."
"x159",""
"x159","Then the Satyr raised a doubt.  I answered him.  Then one of the dappled"
"x159","things objected, and an animated discussion sprang up round the fire."
"x159","Every moment I began to feel more convinced of my present security."
"x159","I talked now without the catching in my breath, due to the intensity"
"x159","of my excitement, that had troubled me at first.  In the course of about"
"x159","an hour I had really convinced several of the Beast Folk of the truth"
"x159","of my assertions, and talked most of the others into a dubious state."
"x159","I kept a sharp eye for my enemy the Hyena-swine, but he never appeared."
"x159","Every now and then a suspicious movement would startle me, but my"
"x159","confidence grew rapidly.  Then as the moon crept down from the zenith,"
"x159","one by one the listeners began to yawn (showing the oddest teeth in"
"x159","the light of the sinking fire), and first one and then another retired"
"x159","towards the dens in the ravine; and I, dreading the silence and darkness,"
"x159","went with them, knowing I was safer with several of them than with"
"x159","one alone."
"x159",""
"x159","In this manner began the longer part of my sojourn upon this"
"x159","Island of Doctor Moreau.  But from that night until the end came,"
"x159","there was but one thing happened to tell save a series of innumerable"
"x159","small unpleasant details and the fretting of an incessant uneasiness."
"x159","So that I prefer to make no chronicle for that gap of time,"
"x159","to tell only one cardinal incident of the ten months I spent as an"
"x159","intimate of these half-humanised brutes.  There is much that sticks"
"x159","in my memory that I could write,--things that I would cheerfully"
"x159","give my right hand to forget; but they do not help the telling of"
"x159","the story."
"x159",""
"x159","In the retrospect it is strange to remember how soon I fell"
"x159","in with these monsters' ways, and gained my confidence again."
"x159","I had my quarrels with them of course, and could show some of"
"x159","their teeth-marks still; but they soon gained a wholesome respect"
"x159","for my trick of throwing stones and for the bite of my hatchet."
"x159","And my Saint-Bernard-man's loyalty was of infinite service to me."
"x159","I found their simple scale of honour was based mainly on the capacity"
"x159","for inflicting trenchant wounds.  Indeed, I may say--without vanity,"
"x159","I hope--that I held something like pre-eminence among them."
"x159","One or two, whom in a rare access of high spirits I had scarred"
"x159","rather badly, bore me a grudge; but it vented itself chiefly"
"x159","behind my back, and at a safe distance from my missiles,"
"x159","in grimaces."
"x159",""
"x159","The Hyena-swine avoided me, and I was always on the alert for him."
"x159","My inseparable Dog-man hated and dreaded him intensely."
"x159","I really believe that was at the root of the brute's attachment to me."
"x159","It was soon evident to me that the former monster had tasted blood,"
"x159","and gone the way of the Leopard-man. He formed a lair somewhere in"
"x159","the forest, and became solitary.  Once I tried to induce the Beast Folk to"
"x159","hunt him, but I lacked the authority to make them co-operate for one end."
"x159","Again and again I tried to approach his den and come upon him unaware;"
"x159","but always he was too acute for me, and saw or winded me and got away."
"x159","He too made every forest pathway dangerous to me and my ally"
"x159","with his lurking ambuscades.  The Dog-man scarcely dared to leave"
"x159","my side."
"x159",""
"x159","In the first month or so the Beast Folk, compared with their"
"x159","latter condition, were human enough, and for one or two besides"
"x159","my canine friend I even conceived a friendly tolerance."
"x159","The little pink sloth-creature displayed an odd affection for me,"
"x159","and took to following me about.  The Monkey-man bored me, however;"
"x159","he assumed, on the strength of his five digits, that he was my equal,"
"x159","and was for ever jabbering at me,--jabbering the most arrant nonsense."
"x159","One thing about him entertained me a little:  he had a fantastic trick"
"x159","of coining new words.  He had an idea, I believe, that to gabble"
"x159","about names that meant nothing was the proper use of speech."
"x159","He called it ""Big Thinks"" to distinguish it from ""Little Thinks,"""
"x159","the sane every-day interests of life.  If ever I made a remark"
"x159","he did not understand, he would praise it very much, ask me to say"
"x159","it again, learn it by heart, and go off repeating it, with a word"
"x159","wrong here or there, to all the milder of the Beast People."
"x159","He thought nothing of what was plain and comprehensible."
"x159","I invented some very curious ""Big Thinks"" for his especial use."
"x159","I think now that he was the silliest creature I ever met;"
"x159","he had developed in the most wonderful way the distinctive silliness"
"x159","of man without losing one jot of the natural folly of a monkey."
"x159",""
"x159","This, I say, was in the earlier weeks of my solitude among these brutes."
"x159","During that time they respected the usage established by the Law,"
"x159","and behaved with general decorum.  Once I found another rabbit torn"
"x159","to pieces,--by the Hyena-swine, I am assured,--but that was all."
"x159","It was about May when I first distinctly perceived a growing difference"
"x159","in their speech and carriage, a growing coarseness of articulation,"
"x159","a growing disinclination to talk.  My Monkey-man's jabber multiplied"
"x159","in volume but grew less and less comprehensible, more and more simian."
"x159","Some of the others seemed altogether slipping their hold upon speech,"
"x159","though they still understood what I said to them at that time."
"x159","(Can you imagine language, once clear-cut and exact, softening and"
"x159","guttering, losing shape and import, becoming mere lumps of sound again?)"
"x159","And they walked erect with an increasing difficulty.  Though they"
"x159","evidently felt ashamed of themselves, every now and then I would come"
"x159","upon one or another running on toes and finger-tips, and quite unable"
"x159","to recover the vertical attitude.  They held things more clumsily;"
"x159","drinking by suction, feeding by gnawing, grew commoner every day."
"x159","I realised more keenly than ever what Moreau had told me about"
"x159","the ""stubborn beast-flesh."" They were reverting, and reverting very"
"x159","rapidly."
"x159",""
"x159","Some of them--the pioneers in this, I noticed with some surprise,"
"x159","were all females--began to disregard the injunction of decency,"
"x159","deliberately for the most part.  Others even attempted public outrages"
"x159","upon the institution of monogamy.  The tradition of the Law was clearly"
"x159","losing its force.  I cannot pursue this disagreeable subject."
"x159",""
"x159","My Dog-man imperceptibly slipped back to the dog again; day by day"
"x159","he became dumb, quadrupedal, hairy.  I scarcely noticed the transition"
"x159","from the companion on my right hand to the lurching dog at my side."
"x159",""
"x159","As the carelessness and disorganisation increased from day to day,"
"x159","the lane of dwelling places, at no time very sweet, became so"
"x159","loathsome that I left it, and going across the island made myself"
"x159","a hovel of boughs amid the black ruins of Moreau's enclosure."
"x159","Some memory of pain, I found, still made that place the safest from"
"x159","the Beast Folk."
"x159",""
"x159","It would be impossible to detail every step of the lapsing of"
"x159","these monsters,--to tell how, day by day, the human semblance left them;"
"x159","how they gave up bandagings and wrappings, abandoned at last every"
"x159","stitch of clothing; how the hair began to spread over the exposed limbs;"
"x159","how their foreheads fell away and their faces projected;"
"x159","how the quasi-human intimacy I had permitted myself with some"
"x159","of them in the first month of my loneliness became a shuddering"
"x159","horror to recall."
"x159",""
"x159","The change was slow and inevitable.  For them and for me it came"
"x159","without any definite shock.  I still went among them in safety,"
"x159","because no jolt in the downward glide had released the increasing"
"x159","charge of explosive animalism that ousted the human day by day."
"x159","But I began to fear that soon now that shock must come."
"x159","My Saint-Bernard-brute followed me to the enclosure every night,"
"x159","and his vigilance enabled me to sleep at times in something like peace."
"x159","The little pink sloth-thing became shy and left me, to crawl back"
"x159","to its natural life once more among the tree-branches. We were in just"
"x159","the state of equilibrium that would remain in one of those ""Happy Family"""
"x159","cages which animal-tamers exhibit, if the tamer were to leave it"
"x159","for ever."
"x159",""
"x159","Of course these creatures did not decline into such beasts as"
"x159","the reader has seen in zoological gardens,--into ordinary bears,"
"x159","wolves, tigers, oxen, swine, and apes.  There was still something"
"x159","strange about each; in each Moreau had blended this animal with that."
"x159","One perhaps was ursine chiefly, another feline chiefly, another"
"x159","bovine chiefly; but each was tainted with other creatures,--a kind"
"x159","of generalised animalism appearing through the specific dispositions."
"x159","And the dwindling shreds of the humanity still startled me every"
"x159","now and then,--a momentary recrudescence of speech perhaps,"
"x159","an unexpected dexterity of the fore-feet, a pitiful attempt to"
"x159","walk erect."
"x159",""
"x159","I too must have undergone strange changes.  My clothes hung about"
"x159","me as yellow rags, through whose rents showed the tanned skin."
"x159","My hair grew long, and became matted together.  I am told that"
"x159","even now my eyes have a strange brightness, a swift alertness"
"x159","of movement."
"x159",""
"x159","At first I spent the daylight hours on the southward beach"
"x159","watching for a ship, hoping and praying for a ship."
"x159","I counted on the ""Ipecacuanha"" returning as the year wore on;"
"x159","but she never came.  Five times I saw sails, and thrice smoke;"
"x159","but nothing ever touched the island.  I always had a bonfire ready,"
"x159","but no doubt the volcanic reputation of the island was taken to account"
"x159","for that."
"x159",""
"x159","It was only about September or October that I began to think of making"
"x159","a raft.  By that time my arm had healed, and both my hands were at"
"x159","my service again.  At first, I found my helplessness appalling."
"x159","I had never done any carpentry or such-like work in my life, and I spent"
"x159","day after day in experimental chopping and binding among the trees."
"x159","I had no ropes, and could hit on nothing wherewith to make ropes;"
"x159","none of the abundant creepers seemed limber or strong enough,"
"x159","and with all my litter of scientific education I could not devise"
"x159","any way of making them so.  I spent more than a fortnight"
"x159","grubbing among the black ruins of the enclosure and on"
"x159","the beach where the boats had been burnt, looking for nails"
"x159","and other stray pieces of metal that might prove of service."
"x159","Now and then some Beast-creature would watch me, and go leaping"
"x159","off when I called to it.  There came a season of thunder-storms"
"x159","and heavy rain, which greatly retarded my work; but at last the raft"
"x159","was completed."
"x159",""
"x159","I was delighted with it.  But with a certain lack of practical sense"
"x159","which has always been my bane, I had made it a mile or more from the sea;"
"x159","and before I had dragged it down to the beach the thing had fallen"
"x159","to pieces.  Perhaps it is as well that I was saved from launching it;"
"x159","but at the time my misery at my failure was so acute that for some"
"x159","days I simply moped on the beach, and stared at the water and thought"
"x159","of death."
"x159",""
"x159","I did not, however, mean to die, and an incident occurred that warned"
"x159","me unmistakably of the folly of letting the days pass so,--for each"
"x159","fresh day was fraught with increasing danger from the Beast People."
"x159",""
"x159","I was lying in the shade of the enclosure wall, staring out to sea,"
"x159","when I was startled by something cold touching the skin of my heel,"
"x159","and starting round found the little pink sloth-creature blinking"
"x159","into my face.  He had long since lost speech and active movement,"
"x159","and the lank hair of the little brute grew thicker every day and his"
"x159","stumpy claws more askew.  He made a moaning noise when he saw he had"
"x159","attracted my attention, went a little way towards the bushes and looked"
"x159","back at me."
"x159",""
"x159","At first I did not understand, but presently it occurred to me that"
"x159","he wished me to follow him; and this I did at last,--slowly, for the day"
"x159","was hot.  When we reached the trees he clambered into them, for he could"
"x159","travel better among their swinging creepers than on the ground."
"x159","And suddenly in a trampled space I came upon a ghastly group."
"x159","My Saint-Bernard-creature lay on the ground, dead; and near"
"x159","his body crouched the Hyena-swine, gripping the quivering flesh"
"x159","with its misshapen claws, gnawing at it, and snarling with delight."
"x159","As I approached, the monster lifted its glaring eyes to mine,"
"x159","its lips went trembling back from its red-stained teeth,"
"x159","and it growled menacingly.  It was not afraid and not ashamed;"
"x159","the last vestige of the human taint had vanished.  I advanced a step"
"x159","farther, stopped, and pulled out my revolver.  At last I had him face"
"x159","to face."
"x159",""
"x159","The brute made no sign of retreat; but its ears went back,"
"x159","its hair bristled, and its body crouched together."
"x159","I aimed between the eyes and fired.  As I did so, the Thing rose"
"x159","straight at me in a leap, and I was knocked over like a ninepin."
"x159","It clutched at me with its crippled hand, and struck me in the face."
"x159","Its spring carried it over me.  I fell under the hind part of its body;"
"x159","but luckily I had hit as I meant, and it had died even as it leapt."
"x159","I crawled out from under its unclean weight and stood up trembling,"
"x159","staring at its quivering body.  That danger at least was over;"
"x159","but this, I knew was only the first of the series of relapses that"
"x159","must come."
"x159",""
"x159","I burnt both of the bodies on a pyre of brushwood; but after that I saw"
"x159","that unless I left the island my death was only a question of time."
"x159","The Beast People by that time had, with one or two exceptions,"
"x159","left the ravine and made themselves lairs according to their taste"
"x159","among the thickets of the island.  Few prowled by day, most of"
"x159","them slept, and the island might have seemed deserted to a new-comer;"
"x159","but at night the air was hideous with their calls and howling."
"x159","I had half a mind to make a massacre of them; to build traps,"
"x159","or fight them with my knife.  Had I possessed sufficient cartridges,"
"x159","I should not have hesitated to begin the killing.  There could"
"x159","now be scarcely a score left of the dangerous carnivores;"
"x159","the braver of these were already dead.  After the death of this poor"
"x159","dog of mine, my last friend, I too adopted to some extent the practice"
"x159","of slumbering in the daytime in order to be on my guard at night."
"x159","I rebuilt my den in the walls of the enclosure, with such a narrow"
"x159","opening that anything attempting to enter must necessarily make"
"x159","a considerable noise.  The creatures had lost the art of fire too,"
"x159","and recovered their fear of it.  I turned once more, almost passionately"
"x159","now, to hammering together stakes and branches to form a raft for"
"x159","my escape."
"x159",""
"x159","I found a thousand difficulties.  I am an extremely unhandy man"
"x159","(my schooling was over before the days of Slojd); but most"
"x159","of the requirements of a raft I met at last in some clumsy,"
"x159","circuitous way or other, and this time I took care of the strength."
"x159","The only insurmountable obstacle was that I had no vessel to contain"
"x159","the water I should need if I floated forth upon these untravelled seas."
"x159","I would have even tried pottery, but the island contained no clay."
"x159","I used to go moping about the island trying with all my might"
"x159","to solve this one last difficulty.  Sometimes I would give"
"x159","way to wild outbursts of rage, and hack and splinter some"
"x159","unlucky tree in my intolerable vexation.  But I could think"
"x159","of nothing."
"x159",""
"x159","And then came a day, a wonderful day, which I spent in ecstasy."
"x159","I saw a sail to the southwest, a small sail like that of a little schooner;"
"x159","and forthwith I lit a great pile of brushwood, and stood by it in"
"x159","the heat of it, and the heat of the midday sun, watching.  All day I"
"x159","watched that sail, eating or drinking nothing, so that my head reeled;"
"x159","and the Beasts came and glared at me, and seemed to wonder,"
"x159","and went away.  It was still distant when night came and swallowed"
"x159","it up; and all night I toiled to keep my blaze bright and high,"
"x159","and the eyes of the Beasts shone out of the darkness, marvelling."
"x159","In the dawn the sail was nearer, and I saw it was the dirty"
"x159","lug-sail of a small boat.  But it sailed strangely.  My eyes were"
"x159","weary with watching, and I peered and could not believe them."
"x159","Two men were in the boat, sitting low down,--one by the bows,"
"x159","the other at the rudder.  The head was not kept to the wind; it yawed and"
"x159","fell away."
"x159",""
"x159","As the day grew brighter, I began waving the last rag of my jacket to them;"
"x159","but they did not notice me, and sat still, facing each other.  I went"
"x159","to the lowest point of the low headland, and gesticulated and shouted."
"x159","There was no response, and the boat kept on her aimless course,"
"x159","making slowly, very slowly, for the bay.  Suddenly a great white bird"
"x159","flew up out of the boat, and neither of the men stirred nor noticed it;"
"x159","it circled round, and then came sweeping overhead with its strong"
"x159","wings outspread."
"x159",""
"x159","Then I stopped shouting, and sat down on the headland and rested my chin"
"x159","on my hands and stared.  Slowly, slowly, the boat drove past towards"
"x159","the west.  I would have swum out to it, but something--a cold, vague"
"x159","fear--kept me back.  In the afternoon the tide stranded the boat, and left"
"x159","it a hundred yards or so to the westward of the ruins of the enclosure."
"x159","The men in it were dead, had been dead so long that they fell"
"x159","to pieces when I tilted the boat on its side and dragged them out."
"x159","One had a shock of red hair, like the captain of the ""Ipecacuanha,"" and"
"x159","a dirty white cap lay in the bottom of the boat."
"x159",""
"x159","As I stood beside the boat, three of the Beasts came slinking"
"x159","out of the bushes and sniffing towards me.  One of my spasms"
"x159","of disgust came upon me.  I thrust the little boat down the beach"
"x159","and clambered on board her.  Two of the brutes were Wolf-beasts,"
"x159","and came forward with quivering nostrils and glittering eyes;"
"x159","the third was the horrible nondescript of bear and bull."
"x159","When I saw them approaching those wretched remains, heard them"
"x159","snarling at one another and caught the gleam of their teeth,"
"x159","a frantic horror succeeded my repulsion.  I turned my back upon them,"
"x159","struck the lug and began paddling out to sea.  I could not bring myself"
"x159","to look behind me."
"x159",""
"x159","I lay, however, between the reef and the island that night,"
"x159","and the next morning went round to the stream and filled the empty"
"x159","keg aboard with water.  Then, with such patience as I could command,"
"x159","I collected a quantity of fruit, and waylaid and killed two rabbits"
"x159","with my last three cartridges.  While I was doing this I left"
"x159","the boat moored to an inward projection of the reef, for fear"
"x159","of the Beast People."

"x159","XXII.  THE MAN ALONE."
"x159",""
"x159",""
"x159","IN the evening I started, and drove out to sea before a gentle wind"
"x159","from the southwest, slowly, steadily; and the island grew smaller"
"x159","and smaller, and the lank spire of smoke dwindled to a finer and"
"x159","finer line against the hot sunset.  The ocean rose up around me,"
"x159","hiding that low, dark patch from my eyes.  The daylight, the trailing"
"x159","glory of the sun, went streaming out of the sky, was drawn aside"
"x159","like some luminous curtain, and at last I looked into the blue"
"x159","gulf of immensity which the sunshine hides, and saw the floating"
"x159","hosts of the stars.  The sea was silent, the sky was silent."
"x159","I was alone with the night and silence."
"x159",""
"x159","So I drifted for three days, eating and drinking sparingly, and meditating"
"x159","upon all that had happened to me,--not desiring very greatly then to see"
"x159","men again.  One unclean rag was about me, my hair a black tangle:"
"x159","no doubt my discoverers thought me a madman."
"x159",""
"x159","It is strange, but I felt no desire to return to mankind."
"x159","I was only glad to be quit of the foulness of the Beast People."
"x159","And on the third day I was picked up by a brig from Apia to San Francisco."
"x159","Neither the captain nor the mate would believe my story, judging that"
"x159","solitude and danger had made me mad; and fearing their opinion might"
"x159","be that of others, I refrained from telling my adventure further,"
"x159","and professed to recall nothing that had happened to me between"
"x159","the loss of the ""Lady Vain"" and the time when I was picked up again,--the"
"x159","space of a year."
"x159",""
"x159","I had to act with the utmost circumspection to save myself from the"
"x159","suspicion of insanity.  My memory of the Law, of the two dead sailors,"
"x159","of the ambuscades of the darkness, of the body in the canebrake,"
"x159","haunted me; and, unnatural as it seems, with my return to mankind came,"
"x159","instead of that confidence and sympathy I had expected, a strange"
"x159","enhancement of the uncertainty and dread I had experienced"
"x159","during my stay upon the island.  No one would believe me;"
"x159","I was almost as queer to men as I had been to the Beast People."
"x159","I may have caught something of the natural wildness of my companions."
"x159","They say that terror is a disease, and anyhow I can witness that for"
"x159","several years now a restless fear has dwelt in my mind,--such a restless"
"x159","fear as a half-tamed lion cub may feel."
"x159",""
"x159","My trouble took the strangest form.  I could not persuade myself"
"x159","that the men and women I met were not also another Beast People,"
"x159","animals half wrought into the outward image of human souls, and that they"
"x159","would presently begin to revert,--to show first this bestial mark"
"x159","and then that.  But I have confided my case to a strangely able"
"x159","man,--a man who had known Moreau, and seemed half to credit my story;"
"x159","a mental specialist,--and he has helped me mightily, though I do not"
"x159","expect that the terror of that island will ever altogether leave me."
"x159","At most times it lies far in the back of my mind, a mere distant cloud,"
"x159","a memory, and a faint distrust; but there are times when the little"
"x159","cloud spreads until it obscures the whole sky.  Then I look about me"
"x159","at my fellow-men; and I go in fear.  I see faces, keen and bright;"
"x159","others dull or dangerous; others, unsteady, insincere,--none that"
"x159","have the calm authority of a reasonable soul.  I feel as though"
"x159","the animal was surging up through them; that presently the degradation"
"x159","of the Islanders will be played over again on a larger scale."
"x159","I know this is an illusion; that these seeming men and women about"
"x159","me are indeed men and women,--men and women for ever, perfectly"
"x159","reasonable creatures, full of human desires and tender solicitude,"
"x159","emancipated from instinct and the slaves of no fantastic"
"x159","Law,--beings altogether different from the Beast Folk.  Yet I shrink"
"x159","from them, from their curious glances, their inquiries and assistance,"
"x159","and long to be away from them and alone.  For that reason I live near"
"x159","the broad free downland, and can escape thither when this shadow"
"x159","is over my soul; and very sweet is the empty downland then, under the"
"x159","wind-swept sky."
"x159",""
"x159","When I lived in London the horror was well-nigh insupportable."
"x159","I could not get away from men:  their voices came through windows;"
"x159","locked doors were flimsy safeguards.  I would go out into the streets"
"x159","to fight with my delusion, and prowling women would mew after me;"
"x159","furtive, craving men glance jealously at me; weary, pale workers"
"x159","go coughing by me with tired eyes and eager paces, like wounded"
"x159","deer dripping blood; old people, bent and dull, pass murmuring"
"x159","to themselves; and, all unheeding, a ragged tail of gibing children."
"x159","Then I would turn aside into some chapel,--and even there,"
"x159","such was my disturbance, it seemed that the preacher gibbered"
"x159","""Big Thinks,"" even as the Ape-man had done; or into some library,"
"x159","and there the intent faces over the books seemed but patient"
"x159","creatures waiting for prey.  Particularly nauseous were the blank,"
"x159","expressionless faces of people in trains and omnibuses;"
"x159","they seemed no more my fellow-creatures than dead bodies would be,"
"x159","so that I did not dare to travel unless I was assured of being alone."
"x159","And even it seemed that I too was not a reasonable creature,"
"x159","but only an animal tormented with some strange disorder in its"
"x159","brain which sent it to wander alone, like a sheep stricken"
"x159","with gid."
"x159",""
"x159","This is a mood, however, that comes to me now, I thank God,"
"x159","more rarely.  I have withdrawn myself from the confusion of cities"
"x159","and multitudes, and spend my days surrounded by wise books,--bright"
"x159","windows in this life of ours, lit by the shining souls of men."
"x159","I see few strangers, and have but a small household."
"x159","My days I devote to reading and to experiments in chemistry,"
"x159","and I spend many of the clear nights in the study of astronomy."
"x159","There is--though I do not know how there is or why there is--a sense"
"x159","of infinite peace and protection in the glittering hosts of heaven."
"x159","There it must be, I think, in the vast and eternal laws of matter,"
"x159","and not in the daily cares and sins and troubles of men, that whatever"
"x159","is more than animal within us must find its solace and its hope.  I hope,"
"x159","or I could not live."
"x159",""
"x159","And so, in hope and solitude, my story ends."

"x5230","THE STRANGE MAN’S ARRIVAL"
"x5230",""
"x5230",""
"x5230","The stranger came early in February, one wintry day, through a biting"
"x5230","wind and a driving snow, the last snowfall of the year, over the down,"
"x5230","walking from Bramblehurst railway station, and carrying a little black"
"x5230","portmanteau in his thickly gloved hand. He was wrapped up from head to"
"x5230","foot, and the brim of his soft felt hat hid every inch of his face but"
"x5230","the shiny tip of his nose; the snow had piled itself against his"
"x5230","shoulders and chest, and added a white crest to the burden he carried."
"x5230","He staggered into the “Coach and Horses” more dead than alive, and"
"x5230","flung his portmanteau down. “A fire,” he cried, “in the name of human"
"x5230","charity! A room and a fire!” He stamped and shook the snow from off"
"x5230","himself in the bar, and followed Mrs. Hall into her guest parlour to"
"x5230","strike his bargain. And with that much introduction, that and a couple"
"x5230","of sovereigns flung upon the table, he took up his quarters in the inn."
"x5230",""
"x5230","Mrs. Hall lit the fire and left him there while she went to prepare him"
"x5230","a meal with her own hands. A guest to stop at Iping in the wintertime"
"x5230","was an unheard-of piece of luck, let alone a guest who was no"
"x5230","“haggler,” and she was resolved to show herself worthy of her good"
"x5230","fortune. As soon as the bacon was well under way, and Millie, her"
"x5230","lymphatic maid, had been brisked up a bit by a few deftly chosen"
"x5230","expressions of contempt, she carried the cloth, plates, and glasses"
"x5230","into the parlour and began to lay them with the utmost _éclat_."
"x5230","Although the fire was burning up briskly, she was surprised to see that"
"x5230","her visitor still wore his hat and coat, standing with his back to her"
"x5230","and staring out of the window at the falling snow in the yard. His"
"x5230","gloved hands were clasped behind him, and he seemed to be lost in"
"x5230","thought. She noticed that the melting snow that still sprinkled his"
"x5230","shoulders dripped upon her carpet. “Can I take your hat and coat, sir?”"
"x5230","she said, “and give them a good dry in the kitchen?”"
"x5230",""
"x5230","“No,” he said without turning."
"x5230",""
"x5230","She was not sure she had heard him, and was about to repeat her"
"x5230","question."
"x5230",""
"x5230","He turned his head and looked at her over his shoulder. “I prefer to"
"x5230","keep them on,” he said with emphasis, and she noticed that he wore big"
"x5230","blue spectacles with sidelights, and had a bush side-whisker over his"
"x5230","coat-collar that completely hid his cheeks and face."
"x5230",""
"x5230","“Very well, sir,” she said. “_As_ you like. In a bit the room will be"
"x5230","warmer.”"
"x5230",""
"x5230","He made no answer, and had turned his face away from her again, and"
"x5230","Mrs. Hall, feeling that her conversational advances were ill-timed,"
"x5230","laid the rest of the table things in a quick staccato and whisked out"
"x5230","of the room. When she returned he was still standing there, like a man"
"x5230","of stone, his back hunched, his collar turned up, his dripping hat-brim"
"x5230","turned down, hiding his face and ears completely. She put down the eggs"
"x5230","and bacon with considerable emphasis, and called rather than said to"
"x5230","him, “Your lunch is served, sir.”"
"x5230",""
"x5230","“Thank you,” he said at the same time, and did not stir until she was"
"x5230","closing the door. Then he swung round and approached the table with a"
"x5230","certain eager quickness."
"x5230",""
"x5230","As she went behind the bar to the kitchen she heard a sound repeated at"
"x5230","regular intervals. Chirk, chirk, chirk, it went, the sound of a spoon"
"x5230","being rapidly whisked round a basin. “That girl!” she said. “There! I"
"x5230","clean forgot it. It’s her being so long!” And while she herself"
"x5230","finished mixing the mustard, she gave Millie a few verbal stabs for her"
"x5230","excessive slowness. She had cooked the ham and eggs, laid the table,"
"x5230","and done everything, while Millie (help indeed!) had only succeeded in"
"x5230","delaying the mustard. And him a new guest and wanting to stay! Then she"
"x5230","filled the mustard pot, and, putting it with a certain stateliness upon"
"x5230","a gold and black tea-tray, carried it into the parlour."
"x5230",""
"x5230","She rapped and entered promptly. As she did so her visitor moved"
"x5230","quickly, so that she got but a glimpse of a white object disappearing"
"x5230","behind the table. It would seem he was picking something from the"
"x5230","floor. She rapped down the mustard pot on the table, and then she"
"x5230","noticed the overcoat and hat had been taken off and put over a chair in"
"x5230","front of the fire, and a pair of wet boots threatened rust to her steel"
"x5230","fender. She went to these things resolutely. “I suppose I may have them"
"x5230","to dry now,” she said in a voice that brooked no denial."
"x5230",""
"x5230","“Leave the hat,” said her visitor, in a muffled voice, and turning she"
"x5230","saw he had raised his head and was sitting and looking at her."
"x5230",""
"x5230","For a moment she stood gaping at him, too surprised to speak."
"x5230",""
"x5230","He held a white cloth—it was a serviette he had brought with him—over"
"x5230","the lower part of his face, so that his mouth and jaws were completely"
"x5230","hidden, and that was the reason of his muffled voice. But it was not"
"x5230","that which startled Mrs. Hall. It was the fact that all his forehead"
"x5230","above his blue glasses was covered by a white bandage, and that another"
"x5230","covered his ears, leaving not a scrap of his face exposed excepting"
"x5230","only his pink, peaked nose. It was bright, pink, and shiny just as it"
"x5230","had been at first. He wore a dark-brown velvet jacket with a high,"
"x5230","black, linen-lined collar turned up about his neck. The thick black"
"x5230","hair, escaping as it could below and between the cross bandages,"
"x5230","projected in curious tails and horns, giving him the strangest"
"x5230","appearance conceivable. This muffled and bandaged head was so unlike"
"x5230","what she had anticipated, that for a moment she was rigid."
"x5230",""
"x5230","He did not remove the serviette, but remained holding it, as she saw"
"x5230","now, with a brown gloved hand, and regarding her with his inscrutable"
"x5230","blue glasses. “Leave the hat,” he said, speaking very distinctly"
"x5230","through the white cloth."
"x5230",""
"x5230","Her nerves began to recover from the shock they had received. She"
"x5230","placed the hat on the chair again by the fire. “I didn’t know, sir,”"
"x5230","she began, “that—” and she stopped embarrassed."
"x5230",""
"x5230","“Thank you,” he said drily, glancing from her to the door and then at"
"x5230","her again."
"x5230",""
"x5230","“I’ll have them nicely dried, sir, at once,” she said, and carried his"
"x5230","clothes out of the room. She glanced at his white-swathed head and blue"
"x5230","goggles again as she was going out of the door; but his napkin was"
"x5230","still in front of his face. She shivered a little as she closed the"
"x5230","door behind her, and her face was eloquent of her surprise and"
"x5230","perplexity. “I _never_,” she whispered. “There!” She went quite softly"
"x5230","to the kitchen, and was too preoccupied to ask Millie what she was"
"x5230","messing about with _now_, when she got there."
"x5230",""
"x5230","The visitor sat and listened to her retreating feet. He glanced"
"x5230","inquiringly at the window before he removed his serviette, and resumed"
"x5230","his meal. He took a mouthful, glanced suspiciously at the window, took"
"x5230","another mouthful, then rose and, taking the serviette in his hand,"
"x5230","walked across the room and pulled the blind down to the top of the"
"x5230","white muslin that obscured the lower panes. This left the room in a"
"x5230","twilight. This done, he returned with an easier air to the table and"
"x5230","his meal."
"x5230",""
"x5230","“The poor soul’s had an accident or an op’ration or somethin’,” said"
"x5230","Mrs. Hall. “What a turn them bandages did give me, to be sure!”"
"x5230",""
"x5230","She put on some more coal, unfolded the clothes-horse, and extended the"
"x5230","traveller’s coat upon this. “And they goggles! Why, he looked more like"
"x5230","a divin’ helmet than a human man!” She hung his muffler on a corner of"
"x5230","the horse. “And holding that handkerchief over his mouth all the time."
"x5230","Talkin’ through it! ... Perhaps his mouth was hurt too—maybe.”"
"x5230",""
"x5230","She turned round, as one who suddenly remembers. “Bless my soul alive!”"
"x5230","she said, going off at a tangent; “ain’t you done them taters _yet_,"
"x5230","Millie?”"
"x5230",""
"x5230","When Mrs. Hall went to clear away the stranger’s lunch, her idea that"
"x5230","his mouth must also have been cut or disfigured in the accident she"
"x5230","supposed him to have suffered, was confirmed, for he was smoking a"
"x5230","pipe, and all the time that she was in the room he never loosened the"
"x5230","silk muffler he had wrapped round the lower part of his face to put the"
"x5230","mouthpiece to his lips. Yet it was not forgetfulness, for she saw he"
"x5230","glanced at it as it smouldered out. He sat in the corner with his back"
"x5230","to the window-blind and spoke now, having eaten and drunk and being"
"x5230","comfortably warmed through, with less aggressive brevity than before."
"x5230","The reflection of the fire lent a kind of red animation to his big"
"x5230","spectacles they had lacked hitherto."
"x5230",""
"x5230","“I have some luggage,” he said, “at Bramblehurst station,” and he asked"
"x5230","her how he could have it sent. He bowed his bandaged head quite"
"x5230","politely in acknowledgment of her explanation. “To-morrow?” he said."
"x5230","“There is no speedier delivery?” and seemed quite disappointed when she"
"x5230","answered, “No.” Was she quite sure? No man with a trap who would go"
"x5230","over?"
"x5230",""
"x5230","Mrs. Hall, nothing loath, answered his questions and developed a"
"x5230","conversation. “It’s a steep road by the down, sir,” she said in answer"
"x5230","to the question about a trap; and then, snatching at an opening, said,"
"x5230","“It was there a carriage was upsettled, a year ago and more. A"
"x5230","gentleman killed, besides his coachman. Accidents, sir, happen in a"
"x5230","moment, don’t they?”"
"x5230",""
"x5230","But the visitor was not to be drawn so easily. “They do,” he said"
"x5230","through his muffler, eyeing her quietly through his impenetrable"
"x5230","glasses."
"x5230",""
"x5230","“But they take long enough to get well, don’t they? ... There was my"
"x5230","sister’s son, Tom, jest cut his arm with a scythe, tumbled on it in the"
"x5230","’ayfield, and, bless me! he was three months tied up sir. You’d hardly"
"x5230","believe it. It’s regular given me a dread of a scythe, sir.”"
"x5230",""
"x5230","“I can quite understand that,” said the visitor."
"x5230",""
"x5230","“He was afraid, one time, that he’d have to have an op’ration—he was"
"x5230","that bad, sir.”"
"x5230",""
"x5230","The visitor laughed abruptly, a bark of a laugh that he seemed to bite"
"x5230","and kill in his mouth. “_Was_ he?” he said."
"x5230",""
"x5230","“He was, sir. And no laughing matter to them as had the doing for him,"
"x5230","as I had—my sister being took up with her little ones so much. There"
"x5230","was bandages to do, sir, and bandages to undo. So that if I may make so"
"x5230","bold as to say it, sir—”"
"x5230",""
"x5230","“Will you get me some matches?” said the visitor, quite abruptly. “My"
"x5230","pipe is out.”"
"x5230",""
"x5230","Mrs. Hall was pulled up suddenly. It was certainly rude of him, after"
"x5230","telling him all she had done. She gasped at him for a moment, and"
"x5230","remembered the two sovereigns. She went for the matches."
"x5230",""
"x5230","“Thanks,” he said concisely, as she put them down, and turned his"
"x5230","shoulder upon her and stared out of the window again. It was altogether"
"x5230","too discouraging. Evidently he was sensitive on the topic of operations"
"x5230","and bandages. She did not “make so bold as to say,” however, after all."
"x5230","But his snubbing way had irritated her, and Millie had a hot time of it"
"x5230","that afternoon."
"x5230",""
"x5230","The visitor remained in the parlour until four o’clock, without giving"
"x5230","the ghost of an excuse for an intrusion. For the most part he was quite"
"x5230","still during that time; it would seem he sat in the growing darkness"
"x5230","smoking in the firelight—perhaps dozing."
"x5230",""
"x5230","Once or twice a curious listener might have heard him at the coals, and"
"x5230","for the space of five minutes he was audible pacing the room. He seemed"

"x5230","fire—which lit his eyes like adverse railway signals, but left his"
"x5230","downcast face in darkness—and the scanty vestiges of the day that came"
"x5230","in through the open door. Everything was ruddy, shadowy, and indistinct"
"x5230","to her, the more so since she had just been lighting the bar lamp, and"
"x5230","her eyes were dazzled. But for a second it seemed to her that the man"
"x5230","she looked at had an enormous mouth wide open—a vast and incredible"
"x5230","mouth that swallowed the whole of the lower portion of his face. It was"
"x5230","the sensation of a moment: the white-bound head, the monstrous goggle"
"x5230","eyes, and this huge yawn below it. Then he stirred, started up in his"
"x5230","chair, put up his hand. She opened the door wide, so that the room was"
"x5230","lighter, and she saw him more clearly, with the muffler held up to his"
"x5230","face just as she had seen him hold the serviette before. The shadows,"
"x5230","she fancied, had tricked her."

"x5230","Mrs. Hall went away to get a lamp, and he rose and stretched himself."

"x5230","“But I’m really glad to have the clock seen to,” he said, seeing a"
"x5230","certain hesitation in Mr. Henfrey’s manner. “Very glad.” Mr. Henfrey"
"x5230","had intended to apologise and withdraw, but this anticipation reassured"
"x5230","him. The stranger turned round with his back to the fireplace and put"
"x5230","his hands behind his back. “And presently,” he said, “when the"
"x5230","clock-mending is over, I think I should like to have some tea. But not"
"x5230","till the clock-mending is over.”"

"x5230","about his boxes at Bramblehurst. She told him she had mentioned the"

"x5230",""

"x5230","Lock myself up. Sometimes—now and then. Not at present, certainly. At"
"x5230","such times the slightest disturbance, the entry of a stranger into the"

"x5230","After Mrs. Hall had left the room, he remained standing in front of the"

"x5230","extracted the works; and he tried to work in as slow and quiet and"
"x5230","unassuming a manner as possible. He worked with the lamp close to him,"
"x5230","and the green shade threw a brilliant light upon his hands, and upon"
"x5230","the frame and wheels, and left the rest of the room shadowy. When he"
"x5230","looked up, coloured patches swam in his eyes. Being constitutionally of"
"x5230","a curious nature, he had removed the works—a quite unnecessary"
"x5230","proceeding—with the idea of delaying his departure and perhaps falling"
"x5230","into conversation with the stranger. But the stranger stood there,"
"x5230","perfectly silent and still. So still, it got on Henfrey’s nerves. He"
"x5230","felt alone in the room and looked up, and there, grey and dim, was the"
"x5230","bandaged head and huge blue lenses staring fixedly, with a mist of"
"x5230","green spots drifting in front of them. It was so uncanny to Henfrey"
"x5230","that for a minute they remained staring blankly at one another. Then"
"x5230","Henfrey looked down again. Very uncomfortable position! One would like"
"x5230","to say something. Should he remark that the weather was very cold for"

"x5230",""
"x5230","He told Hall how his aunt at Hastings had been swindled by a stranger"

"x5230","Teddy trudged on his way with his mind considerably relieved."

"x5230","Instead of “seeing ’bout it,” however, Hall on his return was severely"

"x5230","the point. But the seed of suspicion Teddy had sown germinated in the"
"x5230","mind of Mr. Hall in spite of these discouragements. “You wim’ don’t"
"x5230","know everything,” said Mr. Hall, resolved to ascertain more about the"
"x5230","personality of his guest at the earliest possible opportunity. And"
"x5230","after the stranger had gone to bed, which he did about half-past nine,"
"x5230","Mr. Hall went very aggressively into the parlour and looked very hard"
"x5230","at his wife’s furniture, just to show that the stranger wasn’t master"
"x5230","there, and scrutinised closely and a little contemptuously a sheet of"
"x5230","mathematical computations the stranger had left. When retiring for the"
"x5230","night he instructed Mrs. Hall to look very closely at the stranger’s"
"x5230","luggage when it came next day."
"x5230",""
"x5230","“You mind your own business, Hall,” said Mrs. Hall, “and I’ll mind"

"x5230",""
"x5230","She was all the more inclined to snap at Hall because the stranger was"
"x5230","undoubtedly an unusually strange sort of stranger, and she was by no"

"x5230","woke up dreaming of huge white heads like turnips, that came trailing"

"x5230","THE THOUSAND AND ONE BOTTLES"
"x5230",""
"x5230",""
"x5230","So it was that on the twenty-ninth day of February, at the beginning of"
"x5230","the thaw, this singular person fell out of infinity into Iping village."
"x5230","Next day his luggage arrived through the slush—and very remarkable"
"x5230","luggage it was. There were a couple of trunks indeed, such as a"
"x5230","rational man might need, but in addition there were a box of books—big,"
"x5230","fat books, of which some were just in an incomprehensible"
"x5230","handwriting—and a dozen or more crates, boxes, and cases, containing"
"x5230","objects packed in straw, as it seemed to Hall, tugging with a casual"
"x5230","curiosity at the straw—glass bottles. The stranger, muffled in hat,"
"x5230","coat, gloves, and wrapper, came out impatiently to meet Fearenside’s"
"x5230","cart, while Hall was having a word or so of gossip preparatory to"
"x5230","helping bring them in. Out he came, not noticing Fearenside’s dog, who"
"x5230","was sniffing in a _dilettante_ spirit at Hall’s legs. “Come along with"
"x5230","those boxes,” he said. “I’ve been waiting long enough.”"
"x5230",""

"x5230","hands on the smaller crate."

"x5230","No sooner had Fearenside’s dog caught sight of him, however, than it"
"x5230","began to bristle and growl savagely, and when he rushed down the steps"

"x5230","cried Hall, jumping back, for he was no hero with dogs, and Fearenside"
"x5230","howled, “Lie down!” and snatched his whip."

"x5230","heard the rip of his trousering. Then the finer end of Fearenside’s"
"x5230","whip reached his property, and the dog, yelping with dismay, retreated"
"x5230","under the wheels of the waggon. It was all the business of a swift"
"x5230","half-minute. No one spoke, everyone shouted. The stranger glanced"
"x5230","swiftly at his torn glove and at his leg, made as if he would stoop to"
"x5230","the latter, then turned and rushed swiftly up the steps into the inn."
"x5230","They heard him go headlong across the passage and up the uncarpeted"
"x5230","stairs to his bedroom."

"x5230","“You brute, you!” said Fearenside, climbing off the waggon with his"

"x5230",""
"x5230","Hall had stood gaping. “He wuz bit,” said Hall. “I’d better go and see"

"x5230",""
"x5230","He went straight upstairs, and the stranger’s door being ajar, he"

"x5230","The blind was down and the room dim. He caught a glimpse of a most"
"x5230","singular thing, what seemed a handless arm waving towards him, and a"
"x5230","face of three huge indeterminate spots on white, very like the face of"
"x5230","a pale pansy. Then he was struck violently in the chest, hurled back,"
"x5230","and the door slammed in his face and locked. It was so rapid that it"
"x5230","gave him no time to observe. A waving of indecipherable shapes, a blow,"
"x5230","and a concussion. There he stood on the dark little landing, wondering"
"x5230","what it might be that he had seen."
"x5230",""
"x5230","A couple of minutes after, he rejoined the little group that had formed"
"x5230","outside the “Coach and Horses.” There was Fearenside telling about it"
"x5230","all over again for the second time; there was Mrs. Hall saying his dog"
"x5230","didn’t have no business to bite her guests; there was Huxter, the"
"x5230","general dealer from over the road, interrogative; and Sandy Wadgers"

"x5230","Mr. Hall, staring at them from the steps and listening, found it"

"x5230","slender bottles containing coloured and white fluids, fluted blue"
"x5230","bottles labeled Poison, bottles with round bodies and slender necks,"
"x5230","large green-glass bottles, large white-glass bottles, bottles with"

"x5230",">MR. CUSS INTERVIEWS THE STRANGER"
"x5230",""
"x5230",""
"x5230","I have told the circumstances of the stranger’s arrival in Iping with a"
"x5230","certain fulness of detail, in order that the curious impression he"
"x5230","created may be understood by the reader. But excepting two odd"
"x5230","incidents, the circumstances of his stay until the extraordinary day of"
"x5230","the club festival may be passed over very cursorily. There were a"
"x5230","number of skirmishes with Mrs. Hall on matters of domestic discipline,"
"x5230","but in every case until late April, when the first signs of penury"
"x5230","began, he over-rode her by the easy expedient of an extra payment. Hall"
"x5230","did not like him, and whenever he dared he talked of the advisability"
"x5230","of getting rid of him; but he showed his dislike chiefly by concealing"
"x5230","it ostentatiously, and avoiding his visitor as much as possible. “Wait"
"x5230","till the summer,” said Mrs. Hall sagely, “when the artisks are"
"x5230","beginning to come. Then we’ll see. He may be a bit overbearing, but"
"x5230","bills settled punctual is bills settled punctual, whatever you’d like"
"x5230","to say.”"
"x5230",""
"x5230","The stranger did not go to church, and indeed made no difference"
"x5230","between Sunday and the irreligious days, even in costume. He worked, as"
"x5230","Mrs. Hall thought, very fitfully. Some days he would come down early"
"x5230","and be continuously busy. On others he would rise late, pace his room,"
"x5230","fretting audibly for hours together, smoke, sleep in the armchair by"
"x5230","the fire. Communication with the world beyond the village he had none."
"x5230","His temper continued very uncertain; for the most part his manner was"
"x5230","that of a man suffering under almost unendurable provocation, and once"
"x5230","or twice things were snapped, torn, crushed, or broken in spasmodic"
"x5230","gusts of violence. He seemed under a chronic irritation of the greatest"
"x5230","intensity. His habit of talking to himself in a low voice grew steadily"
"x5230","upon him, but though Mrs. Hall listened conscientiously she could make"
"x5230","neither head nor tail of what she heard."
"x5230",""
"x5230","He rarely went abroad by daylight, but at twilight he would go out"
"x5230","muffled up invisibly, whether the weather were cold or not, and he"
"x5230","chose the loneliest paths and those most overshadowed by trees and"
"x5230","banks. His goggling spectacles and ghastly bandaged face under the"
"x5230","penthouse of his hat, came with a disagreeable suddenness out of the"
"x5230","darkness upon one or two home-going labourers, and Teddy Henfrey,"
"x5230","tumbling out of the “Scarlet Coat” one night, at half-past nine, was"
"x5230","scared shamefully by the stranger’s skull-like head (he was walking hat"
"x5230","in hand) lit by the sudden light of the opened inn door. Such children"
"x5230","as saw him at nightfall dreamt of bogies, and it seemed doubtful"
"x5230","whether he disliked boys more than they disliked him, or the reverse;"
"x5230","but there was certainly a vivid enough dislike on either side."
"x5230",""
"x5230","It was inevitable that a person of so remarkable an appearance and"
"x5230","bearing should form a frequent topic in such a village as Iping."
"x5230","Opinion was greatly divided about his occupation. Mrs. Hall was"
"x5230","sensitive on the point. When questioned, she explained very carefully"
"x5230","that he was an “experimental investigator,” going gingerly over the"
"x5230","syllables as one who dreads pitfalls. When asked what an experimental"
"x5230","investigator was, she would say with a touch of superiority that most"
"x5230","educated people knew such things as that, and would thus explain that"
"x5230","he “discovered things.” Her visitor had had an accident, she said,"
"x5230","which temporarily discoloured his face and hands, and being of a"
"x5230","sensitive disposition, he was averse to any public notice of the fact."
"x5230",""
"x5230","Out of her hearing there was a view largely entertained that he was a"
"x5230","criminal trying to escape from justice by wrapping himself up so as to"
"x5230","conceal himself altogether from the eye of the police. This idea sprang"
"x5230","from the brain of Mr. Teddy Henfrey. No crime of any magnitude dating"
"x5230","from the middle or end of February was known to have occurred."
"x5230","Elaborated in the imagination of Mr. Gould, the probationary assistant"
"x5230","in the National School, this theory took the form that the stranger was"
"x5230","an Anarchist in disguise, preparing explosives, and he resolved to"
"x5230","undertake such detective operations as his time permitted. These"
"x5230","consisted for the most part in looking very hard at the stranger"
"x5230","whenever they met, or in asking people who had never seen the stranger,"
"x5230","leading questions about him. But he detected nothing."
"x5230",""
"x5230","Another school of opinion followed Mr. Fearenside, and either accepted"
"x5230","the piebald view or some modification of it; as, for instance, Silas"
"x5230","Durgan, who was heard to assert that “if he chooses to show enself at"
"x5230","fairs he’d make his fortune in no time,” and being a bit of a"
"x5230","theologian, compared the stranger to the man with the one talent. Yet"
"x5230","another view explained the entire matter by regarding the stranger as a"
"x5230","harmless lunatic. That had the advantage of accounting for everything"
"x5230","straight away."
"x5230",""
"x5230","Between these main groups there were waverers and compromisers. Sussex"
"x5230","folk have few superstitions, and it was only after the events of early"
"x5230","April that the thought of the supernatural was first whispered in the"
"x5230","village. Even then it was only credited among the women folk."
"x5230",""
"x5230","But whatever they thought of him, people in Iping, on the whole, agreed"
"x5230","in disliking him. His irritability, though it might have been"
"x5230","comprehensible to an urban brain-worker, was an amazing thing to these"
"x5230","quiet Sussex villagers. The frantic gesticulations they surprised now"
"x5230","and then, the headlong pace after nightfall that swept him upon them"
"x5230","round quiet corners, the inhuman bludgeoning of all tentative advances"
"x5230","of curiosity, the taste for twilight that led to the closing of doors,"
"x5230","the pulling down of blinds, the extinction of candles and lamps—who"
"x5230","could agree with such goings on? They drew aside as he passed down the"
"x5230","village, and when he had gone by, young humourists would up with"
"x5230","coat-collars and down with hat-brims, and go pacing nervously after him"
"x5230","in imitation of his occult bearing. There was a song popular at that"
"x5230","time called “The Bogey Man”. Miss Statchell sang it at the schoolroom"
"x5230","concert (in aid of the church lamps), and thereafter whenever one or"
"x5230","two of the villagers were gathered together and the stranger appeared,"
"x5230","a bar or so of this tune, more or less sharp or flat, was whistled in"
"x5230","the midst of them. Also belated little children would call “Bogey Man!”"
"x5230","after him, and make off tremulously elated."
"x5230",""
"x5230","Cuss, the general practitioner, was devoured by curiosity. The bandages"
"x5230","excited his professional interest, the report of the thousand and one"
"x5230","bottles aroused his jealous regard. All through April and May he"
"x5230","coveted an opportunity of talking to the stranger, and at last, towards"
"x5230","Whitsuntide, he could stand it no longer, but hit upon the"
"x5230","subscription-list for a village nurse as an excuse. He was surprised to"
"x5230","find that Mr. Hall did not know his guest’s name. “He give a name,”"
"x5230","said Mrs. Hall—an assertion which was quite unfounded—“but I didn’t"
"x5230","rightly hear it.” She thought it seemed so silly not to know the man’s"
"x5230","name."
"x5230",""
"x5230","Cuss rapped at the parlour door and entered. There was a fairly audible"
"x5230","imprecation from within. “Pardon my intrusion,” said Cuss, and then the"
"x5230","door closed and cut Mrs. Hall off from the rest of the conversation."
"x5230",""
"x5230","She could hear the murmur of voices for the next ten minutes, then a"
"x5230","cry of surprise, a stirring of feet, a chair flung aside, a bark of"
"x5230","laughter, quick steps to the door, and Cuss appeared, his face white,"
"x5230","his eyes staring over his shoulder. He left the door open behind him,"
"x5230","and without looking at her strode across the hall and went down the"
"x5230","steps, and she heard his feet hurrying along the road. He carried his"
"x5230","hat in his hand. She stood behind the door, looking at the open door of"
"x5230","the parlour. Then she heard the stranger laughing quietly, and then his"
"x5230","footsteps came across the room. She could not see his face where she"
"x5230","stood. The parlour door slammed, and the place was silent again."
"x5230",""
"x5230","Cuss went straight up the village to Bunting the vicar. “Am I mad?”"
"x5230","Cuss began abruptly, as he entered the shabby little study. “Do I look"
"x5230","like an insane person?”"
"x5230",""
"x5230","“What’s happened?” said the vicar, putting the ammonite on the loose"

"x5230",""
"x5230","“Well?”"

"x5230",""
"x5230","When his nerves had been steadied by a glass of cheap sherry—the only"
"x5230","drink the good vicar had available—he told him of the interview he had"

"x5230","that Nurse Fund. He’d stuck his hands in his pockets as I came in, and"
"x5230","he sat down lumpily in his chair. Sniffed. I told him I’d heard he took"
"x5230","an interest in scientific things. He said yes. Sniffed again. Kept on"

"x5230","test-tubes in stands, and a smell of—evening primrose. Would he"
"x5230","subscribe? Said he’d consider it. Asked him, point-blank, was he"
"x5230","researching. Said he was. A long research? Got quite cross. ‘A damnable"
"x5230","long research,’ said he, blowing the cork out, so to speak. ‘Oh,’ said"

"x5230","valuable prescription—what for he wouldn’t say. Was it medical? ‘Damn"
"x5230","you! What are you fishing after?’ I apologised. Dignified sniff and"
"x5230","cough. He resumed. He’d read it. Five ingredients. Put it down; turned"
"x5230","his head. Draught of air from window lifted the paper. Swish, rustle."
"x5230","He was working in a room with an open fireplace, he said. Saw a"
"x5230","flicker, and there was the prescription burning and lifting"

"x5230","Just at that point, to illustrate his story, out came his arm.”"

"x5230","THE BURGLARY AT THE VICARAGE"
"x5230",""
"x5230",""
"x5230","The facts of the burglary at the vicarage came to us chiefly through"
"x5230","the medium of the vicar and his wife. It occurred in the small hours of"
"x5230","Whit Monday, the day devoted in Iping to the Club festivities. Mrs."
"x5230","Bunting, it seems, woke up suddenly in the stillness that comes before"
"x5230","the dawn, with the strong impression that the door of their bedroom had"
"x5230","opened and closed. She did not arouse her husband at first, but sat up"
"x5230","in bed listening. She then distinctly heard the pad, pad, pad of bare"
"x5230","feet coming out of the adjoining dressing-room and walking along the"
"x5230","passage towards the staircase. As soon as she felt assured of this, she"
"x5230","aroused the Rev. Mr. Bunting as quietly as possible. He did not strike"
"x5230","a light, but putting on his spectacles, her dressing-gown and his bath"
"x5230","slippers, he went out on the landing to listen. He heard quite"
"x5230","distinctly a fumbling going on at his study desk down-stairs, and then"
"x5230","a violent sneeze."
"x5230",""
"x5230","At that he returned to his bedroom, armed himself with the most obvious"
"x5230","weapon, the poker, and descended the staircase as noiselessly as"
"x5230","possible. Mrs. Bunting came out on the landing."
"x5230",""
"x5230","The hour was about four, and the ultimate darkness of the night was"
"x5230","past. There was a faint shimmer of light in the hall, but the study"
"x5230","doorway yawned impenetrably black. Everything was still except the"
"x5230","faint creaking of the stairs under Mr. Bunting’s tread, and the slight"
"x5230","movements in the study. Then something snapped, the drawer was opened,"
"x5230","and there was a rustle of papers. Then came an imprecation, and a match"
"x5230","was struck and the study was flooded with yellow light. Mr. Bunting was"
"x5230","now in the hall, and through the crack of the door he could see the"
"x5230","desk and the open drawer and a candle burning on the desk. But the"
"x5230","robber he could not see. He stood there in the hall undecided what to"
"x5230","do, and Mrs. Bunting, her face white and intent, crept slowly"
"x5230","downstairs after him. One thing kept Mr. Bunting’s courage; the"
"x5230","persuasion that this burglar was a resident in the village."

"x5230","They heard the chink of money, and realised that the robber had found"

"x5230","looked behind the screen, while Mr. Bunting, by a kindred impulse,"
"x5230","peered under the desk. Then Mrs. Bunting turned back the"
"x5230","window-curtains, and Mr. Bunting looked up the chimney and probed it"
"x5230","with the poker. Then Mrs. Bunting scrutinised the waste-paper basket"
"x5230","and Mr. Bunting opened the lid of the coal-scuttle. Then they came to a"

"x5230","seeing it closed and nothing there, neither said a word to the other"
"x5230","about it at the time. Mrs. Hall passed her husband in the passage and"
"x5230","ran on first upstairs. Someone sneezed on the staircase. Hall,"
"x5230","following six steps behind, thought that he heard her sneeze. She,"
"x5230","going on first, was under the impression that Hall was sneezing. She"
"x5230","flung open the door and stood regarding the room. “Of all the curious!”"
"x5230","she said."
"x5230",""
"x5230","She heard a sniff close behind her head as it seemed, and turning, was"
"x5230","surprised to see Hall a dozen feet off on the topmost stair. But in"
"x5230","another moment he was beside her. She bent forward and put her hand on"
"x5230","the pillow and then under the clothes."
"x5230",""
"x5230","“Cold,” she said. “He’s been up this hour or more.”"

"x5230","As she did so, a most extraordinary thing happened. The bed-clothes"

"x5230","hand had clutched them in the centre and flung them aside. Immediately"
"x5230","after, the stranger’s hat hopped off the bed-post, described a whirling"
"x5230","flight in the air through the better part of a circle, and then dashed"
"x5230","straight at Mrs. Hall’s face. Then as swiftly came the sponge from the"
"x5230","washstand; and then the chair, flinging the stranger’s coat and"
"x5230","trousers carelessly aside, and laughing drily in a voice singularly"
"x5230","like the stranger’s, turned itself up with its four legs at Mrs. Hall,"
"x5230","seemed to take aim at her for a moment, and charged at her. She"
"x5230","screamed and turned, and then the chair legs came gently but firmly"
"x5230","against her back and impelled her and Hall out of the room. The door"
"x5230","slammed violently and was locked. The chair and bed seemed to be"
"x5230","executing a dance of triumph for a moment, and then abruptly everything"
"x5230","was still."

"x5230","Mrs. Hall was left almost in a fainting condition in Mr. Hall’s arms on"

"x5230","preferred to talk in the passage. Over the way Huxter’s apprentice came"
"x5230","out and began taking down the shutters of the tobacco window. He was"
"x5230","called over to join the discussion. Mr. Huxter naturally followed over"
"x5230","in the course of a few minutes. The Anglo-Saxon genius for"
"x5230","parliamentary government asserted itself; there was a great deal of"
"x5230","talk and no decisive action. “Let’s have the facts first,” insisted Mr."
"x5230","Sandy Wadgers. “Let’s be sure we’d be acting perfectly right in bustin’"

"x5230","rumour of the burglary at the vicarage, and two and two were put"
"x5230","together. Hall, assisted by Wadgers, went off to find Mr. Shuckleforth,"
"x5230","the magistrate, and take his advice. No one ventured upstairs. How the"
"x5230","stranger occupied himself is unknown. Now and then he would stride"
"x5230","violently up and down, and twice came an outburst of curses, a tearing"
"x5230","of paper, and a violent smashing of bottles."
"x5230",""
"x5230","The little group of scared but curious people increased. Mrs. Huxter"
"x5230","came over; some gay young fellows resplendent in black ready-made"
"x5230","jackets and _piqué_ paper ties—for it was Whit Monday—joined the group"
"x5230","with confused interrogations. Young Archie Harker distinguished himself"
"x5230","by going up the yard and trying to peep under the window-blinds. He"

"x5230","staring at his metamorphosed face, accepted automatically. Then, when"

"x5230","You must picture Mr. Thomas Marvel as a person of copious, flexible"
"x5230","visage, a nose of cylindrical protrusion, a liquorish, ample,"
"x5230","fluctuating mouth, and a beard of bristling eccentricity. His figure"
"x5230","inclined to embonpoint; his short limbs accentuated this inclination."
"x5230","He wore a furry silk hat, and the frequent substitution of twine and"
"x5230","shoe-laces for buttons, apparent at critical points of his costume,"
"x5230","marked a man essentially bachelor."

"x5230","Mr. Thomas Marvel was sitting with his feet in a ditch by the roadside"

"x5230","contemplating trying on a pair of boots. They were the soundest boots"
"x5230","he had come across for a long time, but too large for him; whereas the"
"x5230","ones he had were, in dry weather, a very comfortable fit, but too"
"x5230","thin-soled for damp. Mr. Thomas Marvel hated roomy shoes, but then he"
"x5230","hated damp. He had never properly thought out which he hated most, and"
"x5230","it was a pleasant day, and there was nothing better to do. So he put"
"x5230","the four shoes in a graceful group on the turf and looked at them. And"
"x5230","seeing them there among the grass and springing agrimony, it suddenly"

"x5230","The stranger, after some hesitation, leant against one of the"

"x5230","table-cloth in one hand, and three books tied together—as it proved"

"x5230","he gave a sort of gasp, and turning sharply to the left, began to run."
"x5230","“Stop, thief!” cried Huxter, and set off after him. Mr. Huxter’s"
"x5230","sensations were vivid but brief. He saw the man just before him and"
"x5230","spurting briskly for the church corner and the hill road. He saw the"
"x5230","village flags and festivities beyond, and a face or so turned towards"
"x5230","him. He bawled, “Stop!” again. He had hardly gone ten strides before"
"x5230","his shin was caught in some mysterious fashion, and he was no longer"
"x5230","running, but flying with inconceivable rapidity through the air. He saw"
"x5230","the ground suddenly close to his face. The world seemed to splash into"

"x5230","it reflects or refracts it, or does all these things. If it neither"
"x5230","reflects nor refracts nor absorbs light, it cannot of itself be"
"x5230","visible. You see an opaque red box, for instance, because the colour"
"x5230","absorbs some of the light and reflects the rest, all the red part of"
"x5230","the light, to you. If it did not absorb any particular part of the"
"x5230","light, but reflected it all, then it would be a shining white box."
"x5230","Silver! A diamond box would neither absorb much of the light nor"
"x5230","reflect much from the general surface, but just here and there where"
"x5230","the surfaces were favourable the light would be reflected and"
"x5230","refracted, so that you would get a brilliant appearance of flashing"
"x5230","reflections and translucencies—a sort of skeleton of light. A glass box"
"x5230","would not be so brilliant, nor so clearly visible, as a diamond box,"
"x5230","because there would be less refraction and reflection. See that? From"
"x5230","certain points of view you would see quite clearly through it. Some"
"x5230","kinds of glass would be more visible than others, a box of flint glass"
"x5230","would be brighter than a box of ordinary window glass. A box of very"
"x5230","thin common glass would be hard to see in a bad light, because it would"
"x5230","absorb hardly any light and refract and reflect very little. And if you"
"x5230","put a sheet of common white glass in water, still more if you put it in"
"x5230","some denser liquid than water, it would vanish almost altogether,"
"x5230","because light passing from water to glass is only slightly refracted or"
"x5230","reflected or indeed affected in any way. It is almost as invisible as a"
"x5230","jet of coal gas or hydrogen is in air. And for precisely the same"
"x5230","reason!”"
"x5230",""
"x5230","“Yes,” said Kemp, “that is pretty plain sailing.”"
"x5230",""
"x5230","“And here is another fact you will know to be true. If a sheet of glass"
"x5230","is smashed, Kemp, and beaten into a powder, it becomes much more"
"x5230","visible while it is in the air; it becomes at last an opaque white"
"x5230","powder. This is because the powdering multiplies the surfaces of the"
"x5230","glass at which refraction and reflection occur. In the sheet of glass"
"x5230","there are only two surfaces; in the powder the light is reflected or"
"x5230","refracted by each grain it passes through, and very little gets right"
"x5230","through the powder. But if the white powdered glass is put into water,"
"x5230","it forthwith vanishes. The powdered glass and water have much the same"
"x5230","refractive index; that is, the light undergoes very little refraction"
"x5230","or reflection in passing from one to the other."

"x5230","“You make the glass invisible by putting it into a liquid of nearly the"
"x5230","same refractive index; a transparent thing becomes invisible if it is"
"x5230","put in any medium of almost the same refractive index. And if you will"
"x5230","consider only a second, you will see also that the powder of glass"
"x5230","might be made to vanish in air, if its refractive index could be made"
"x5230","the same as that of air; for then there would be no refraction or"

"x5230","One wonders what his state of mind may have been during that time, and"

"x5230","trampled ground, the numerous wounds Mr. Wicksteed received, his"
"x5230","splintered walking-stick; but why the attack was made, save in a"
"x5230","murderous frenzy, it is impossible to imagine. Indeed the theory of"
"x5230","madness is almost unavoidable. Mr. Wicksteed was a man of forty-five or"
"x5230","forty-six, steward to Lord Burdock, of inoffensive habits and"
"x5230","appearance, the very last person in the world to provoke such a"
"x5230","terrible antagonist. Against him it would seem the Invisible Man used"
"x5230","an iron rod dragged from a broken piece of fence. He stopped this quiet"
"x5230","man, going quietly home to his midday meal, attacked him, beat down his"
"x5230","feeble defences, broke his arm, felled him, and smashed his head to a"
"x5230","jelly."
"x5230",""
"x5230","Of course, he must have dragged this rod out of the fencing before he"
"x5230","met his victim—he must have been carrying it ready in his hand. Only"
"x5230","two details beyond what has already been stated seem to bear on the"
"x5230","matter. One is the circumstance that the gravel pit was not in Mr."
"x5230","Wicksteed’s direct path home, but nearly a couple of hundred yards out"
"x5230","of his way. The other is the assertion of a little girl to the effect"
"x5230","that, going to her afternoon school, she saw the murdered man"
"x5230","“trotting” in a peculiar manner across a field towards the gravel pit."
"x5230","Her pantomime of his action suggests a man pursuing something on the"
"x5230","ground before him and striking at it ever and again with his"
"x5230","walking-stick. She was the last person to see him alive. He passed out"
"x5230","of her sight to his death, the struggle being hidden from her only by a"
"x5230","clump of beech trees and a slight depression in the ground."
"x5230",""
"x5230","Now this, to the present writer’s mind at least, lifts the murder out"
"x5230","of the realm of the absolutely wanton. We may imagine that Griffin had"
"x5230","taken the rod as a weapon indeed, but without any deliberate intention"
"x5230","of using it in murder. Wicksteed may then have come by and noticed this"
"x5230","rod inexplicably moving through the air. Without any thought of the"
"x5230","Invisible Man—for Port Burdock is ten miles away—he may have pursued"
"x5230","it. It is quite conceivable that he may not even have heard of the"
"x5230","Invisible Man. One can then imagine the Invisible Man making"
"x5230","off—quietly in order to avoid discovering his presence in the"
"x5230","neighbourhood, and Wicksteed, excited and curious, pursuing this"
"x5230","unaccountably locomotive object—finally striking at it."
"x5230",""
"x5230","No doubt the Invisible Man could easily have distanced his middle-aged"
"x5230","pursuer under ordinary circumstances, but the position in which"
"x5230","Wicksteed’s body was found suggests that he had the ill luck to drive"
"x5230","his quarry into a corner between a drift of stinging nettles and the"
"x5230","gravel pit. To those who appreciate the extraordinary irascibility of"
"x5230","the Invisible Man, the rest of the encounter will be easy to imagine."
"x5230",""
"x5230","But this is pure hypothesis. The only undeniable facts—for stories of"
"x5230","children are often unreliable—are the discovery of Wicksteed’s body,"
"x5230","done to death, and of the blood-stained iron rod flung among the"
"x5230","nettles. The abandonment of the rod by Griffin, suggests that in the"
"x5230","emotional excitement of the affair, the purpose for which he took it—if"
"x5230","he had a purpose—was abandoned. He was certainly an intensely"
"x5230","egotistical and unfeeling man, but the sight of his victim, his first"
"x5230","victim, bloody and pitiful at his feet, may have released some long"
"x5230","pent fountain of remorse which for a time may have flooded whatever"
"x5230","scheme of action he had contrived."
"x5230",""
"x5230","After the murder of Mr. Wicksteed, he would seem to have struck across"
"x5230","the country towards the downland. There is a story of a voice heard"
"x5230","about sunset by a couple of men in a field near Fern Bottom. It was"
"x5230","wailing and laughing, sobbing and groaning, and ever and again it"
"x5230","shouted. It must have been queer hearing. It drove up across the middle"
"x5230","of a clover field and died away towards the hills."
"x5230",""
"x5230","That afternoon the Invisible Man must have learnt something of the"
"x5230","rapid use Kemp had made of his confidences. He must have found houses"
"x5230","locked and secured; he may have loitered about railway stations and"
"x5230","prowled about inns, and no doubt he read the proclamations and realised"
"x5230","something of the nature of the campaign against him. And as the evening"
"x5230","advanced, the fields became dotted here and there with groups of three"
"x5230","or four men, and noisy with the yelping of dogs. These men-hunters had"
"x5230","particular instructions in the case of an encounter as to the way they"
"x5230","should support one another. But he avoided them all. We may understand"
"x5230","something of his exasperation, and it could have been none the less"
"x5230","because he himself had supplied the information that was being used so"
"x5230","remorselessly against him. For that day at least he lost heart; for"
"x5230","nearly twenty-four hours, save when he turned on Wicksteed, he was a"
"x5230","hunted man. In the night, he must have eaten and slept; for in the"
"x5230","morning he was himself again, active, powerful, angry, and malignant,"
"x5230","prepared for his last great struggle against the world."

"x5230","night’s rest. But I have had food in spite of you, I have slept in"
"x5230","spite of you, and the game is only beginning. The game is only"
"x5230","beginning. There is nothing for it, but to start the Terror. This"
"x5230","announces the first day of the Terror. Port Burdock is no longer under"
"x5230","the Queen, tell your Colonel of Police, and the rest of them; it is"
"x5230","under me—the Terror! This is day one of year one of the new epoch—the"
"x5230","Epoch of the Invisible Man. I am Invisible Man the First. To begin with"
"x5230","the rule will be easy. The first day there will be one execution for"
"x5230","the sake of example—a man named Kemp. Death starts for him to-day. He"
"x5230","may lock himself away, hide himself away, get guards about him, put on"
"x5230","armour if he likes—Death, the unseen Death, is coming. Let him take"
"x5230","precautions; it will impress my people. Death starts from the pillar"
"x5230","box by midday. The letter will fall in as the postman comes along, then"
"x5230","off! The game begins. Death starts. Help him not, my people, lest Death"

"x5230","He got up slowly, leaving his lunch unfinished—the letter had come by"
"x5230","the one o’clock post—and went into his study. He rang for his"
"x5230","housekeeper, and told her to go round the house at once, examine all"
"x5230","the fastenings of the windows, and close all the shutters. He closed"
"x5230","the shutters of his study himself. From a locked drawer in his bedroom"
"x5230","he took a little revolver, examined it carefully, and put it into the"
"x5230","pocket of his lounge jacket. He wrote a number of brief notes, one to"
"x5230","Colonel Adye, gave them to his servant to take, with explicit"
"x5230","instructions as to her way of leaving the house. “There is no danger,”"
"x5230","he said, and added a mental reservation, “to you.” He remained"

"x5230","cooling lunch."

"x5230","He ate with gaps of thought. Finally he struck the table sharply. “We"

"x5230","steps. He crossed the lawn and approached the gate. A little breeze"

"x5230","“Whup!” said one policeman, ducked, and caught the axe on his poker."

"x5230","At the first clash the girl screamed, stood screaming for a moment by"

"x5230","The axe receded into the passage, and fell to a position about two feet"

"x5230","Then, as the policeman staggered with the swing of the blow he had"
"x5230","aimed, the Invisible Man countered with the axe, the helmet crumpled"
"x5230","like paper, and the blow sent the man spinning to the floor at the head"
"x5230","of the kitchen stairs. But the second policeman, aiming behind the axe"
"x5230","with his poker, hit something soft that snapped. There was a sharp"
"x5230","exclamation of pain and then the axe fell to the ground. The policeman"
"x5230","wiped again at vacancy and hit nothing; he put his foot on the axe, and"

"x5230","THE HUNTER HUNTED"
"x5230",""
"x5230",""
"x5230","Mr. Heelas, Mr. Kemp’s nearest neighbour among the villa holders, was"
"x5230","asleep in his summer house when the siege of Kemp’s house began. Mr."
"x5230","Heelas was one of the sturdy minority who refused to believe “in all"
"x5230","this nonsense” about an Invisible Man. His wife, however, as he was"
"x5230","subsequently to be reminded, did. He insisted upon walking about his"
"x5230","garden just as if nothing was the matter, and he went to sleep in the"
"x5230","afternoon in accordance with the custom of years. He slept through the"
"x5230","smashing of the windows, and then woke up suddenly with a curious"
"x5230","persuasion of something wrong. He looked across at Kemp’s house, rubbed"
"x5230","his eyes and looked again. Then he put his feet to the ground, and sat"
"x5230","listening. He said he was damned, but still the strange thing was"
"x5230","visible. The house looked as though it had been deserted for"
"x5230","weeks—after a violent riot. Every window was broken, and every window,"
"x5230","save those of the belvedere study, was blinded by the internal"
"x5230","shutters."
"x5230",""
"x5230","“I could have sworn it was all right”—he looked at his watch—“twenty"
"x5230","minutes ago.”"
"x5230",""
"x5230","He became aware of a measured concussion and the clash of glass, far"
"x5230","away in the distance. And then, as he sat open-mouthed, came a still"
"x5230","more wonderful thing. The shutters of the drawing-room window were"
"x5230","flung open violently, and the housemaid in her outdoor hat and"
"x5230","garments, appeared struggling in a frantic manner to throw up the sash."
"x5230","Suddenly a man appeared beside her, helping her—Dr. Kemp! In another"
"x5230","moment the window was open, and the housemaid was struggling out; she"
"x5230","pitched forward and vanished among the shrubs. Mr. Heelas stood up,"
"x5230","exclaiming vaguely and vehemently at all these wonderful things. He saw"
"x5230","Kemp stand on the sill, spring from the window, and reappear almost"
"x5230","instantaneously running along a path in the shrubbery and stooping as"
"x5230","he ran, like a man who evades observation. He vanished behind a"
"x5230","laburnum, and appeared again clambering over a fence that abutted on"
"x5230","the open down. In a second he had tumbled over and was running at a"
"x5230","tremendous pace down the slope towards Mr. Heelas."
"x5230",""
"x5230","“Lord!” cried Mr. Heelas, struck with an idea; “it’s that Invisible Man"
"x5230","brute! It’s right, after all!”"
"x5230",""
"x5230","With Mr. Heelas to think things like that was to act, and his cook"
"x5230","watching him from the top window was amazed to see him come pelting"
"x5230","towards the house at a good nine miles an hour. There was a slamming of"
"x5230","doors, a ringing of bells, and the voice of Mr. Heelas bellowing like a"
"x5230","bull. “Shut the doors, shut the windows, shut everything!—the Invisible"
"x5230","Man is coming!” Instantly the house was full of screams and directions,"
"x5230","and scurrying feet. He ran himself to shut the French windows that"
"x5230","opened on the veranda; as he did so Kemp’s head and shoulders and knee"
"x5230","appeared over the edge of the garden fence. In another moment Kemp had"
"x5230","ploughed through the asparagus, and was running across the tennis lawn"
"x5230","to the house."
"x5230",""
"x5230","“You can’t come in,” said Mr. Heelas, shutting the bolts. “I’m very"
"x5230","sorry if he’s after you, but you can’t come in!”"
"x5230",""
"x5230","Kemp appeared with a face of terror close to the glass, rapping and"
"x5230","then shaking frantically at the French window. Then, seeing his efforts"
"x5230","were useless, he ran along the veranda, vaulted the end, and went to"
"x5230","hammer at the side door. Then he ran round by the side gate to the"
"x5230","front of the house, and so into the hill-road. And Mr. Heelas staring"
"x5230","from his window—a face of horror—had scarcely witnessed Kemp vanish,"
"x5230","ere the asparagus was being trampled this way and that by feet unseen."
"x5230","At that Mr. Heelas fled precipitately upstairs, and the rest of the"
"x5230","chase is beyond his purview. But as he passed the staircase window, he"
"x5230","heard the side gate slam."
"x5230",""
"x5230","Emerging into the hill-road, Kemp naturally took the downward"
"x5230","direction, and so it was he came to run in his own person the very race"
"x5230","he had watched with such a critical eye from the belvedere study only"
"x5230","four days ago. He ran it well, for a man out of training, and though"
"x5230","his face was white and wet, his wits were cool to the last. He ran with"
"x5230","wide strides, and wherever a patch of rough ground intervened, wherever"
"x5230","there came a patch of raw flints, or a bit of broken glass shone"
"x5230","dazzling, he crossed it and left the bare invisible feet that followed"
"x5230","to take what line they would."
"x5230",""
"x5230","For the first time in his life Kemp discovered that the hill-road was"
"x5230","indescribably vast and desolate, and that the beginnings of the town"
"x5230","far below at the hill foot were strangely remote. Never had there been"
"x5230","a slower or more painful method of progression than running. All the"
"x5230","gaunt villas, sleeping in the afternoon sun, looked locked and barred;"
"x5230","no doubt they were locked and barred—by his own orders. But at any rate"
"x5230","they might have kept a lookout for an eventuality like this! The town"
"x5230","was rising up now, the sea had dropped out of sight behind it, and"
"x5230","people down below were stirring. A tram was just arriving at the hill"
"x5230","foot. Beyond that was the police station. Was that footsteps he heard"
"x5230","behind him? Spurt."
"x5230",""
"x5230","The people below were staring at him, one or two were running, and his"
"x5230","breath was beginning to saw in his throat. The tram was quite near now,"
"x5230","and the “Jolly Cricketers” was noisily barring its doors. Beyond the"
"x5230","tram were posts and heaps of gravel—the drainage works. He had a"
"x5230","transitory idea of jumping into the tram and slamming the doors, and"
"x5230","then he resolved to go for the police station. In another moment he had"
"x5230","passed the door of the “Jolly Cricketers,” and was in the blistering"
"x5230","fag end of the street, with human beings about him. The tram driver and"
"x5230","his helper—arrested by the sight of his furious haste—stood staring"
"x5230","with the tram horses unhitched. Further on the astonished features of"
"x5230","navvies appeared above the mounds of gravel."
"x5230",""
"x5230","His pace broke a little, and then he heard the swift pad of his"
"x5230","pursuer, and leapt forward again. “The Invisible Man!” he cried to the"
"x5230","navvies, with a vague indicative gesture, and by an inspiration leapt"
"x5230","the excavation and placed a burly group between him and the chase. Then"
"x5230","abandoning the idea of the police station he turned into a little side"
"x5230","street, rushed by a greengrocer’s cart, hesitated for the tenth of a"
"x5230","second at the door of a sweetstuff shop, and then made for the mouth of"
"x5230","an alley that ran back into the main Hill Street again. Two or three"
"x5230","little children were playing here, and shrieked and scattered at his"
"x5230","apparition, and forthwith doors and windows opened and excited mothers"
"x5230","revealed their hearts. Out he shot into Hill Street again, three"
"x5230","hundred yards from the tram-line end, and immediately he became aware"
"x5230","of a tumultuous vociferation and running people."
"x5230",""
"x5230","He glanced up the street towards the hill. Hardly a dozen yards off ran"
"x5230","a huge navvy, cursing in fragments and slashing viciously with a spade,"
"x5230","and hard behind him came the tram conductor with his fists clenched. Up"
"x5230","the street others followed these two, striking and shouting. Down"
"x5230","towards the town, men and women were running, and he noticed clearly"
"x5230","one man coming out of a shop-door with a stick in his hand. “Spread"
"x5230","out! Spread out!” cried some one. Kemp suddenly grasped the altered"
"x5230","condition of the chase. He stopped, and looked round, panting. “He’s"
"x5230","close here!” he cried. “Form a line across—”"
"x5230",""
"x5230","He was hit hard under the ear, and went reeling, trying to face round"
"x5230","towards his unseen antagonist. He just managed to keep his feet, and he"
"x5230","struck a vain counter in the air. Then he was hit again under the jaw,"
"x5230","and sprawled headlong on the ground. In another moment a knee"
"x5230","compressed his diaphragm, and a couple of eager hands gripped his"
"x5230","throat, but the grip of one was weaker than the other; he grasped the"
"x5230","wrists, heard a cry of pain from his assailant, and then the spade of"
"x5230","the navvy came whirling through the air above him, and struck something"
"x5230","with a dull thud. He felt a drop of moisture on his face. The grip at"
"x5230","his throat suddenly relaxed, and with a convulsive effort, Kemp loosed"
"x5230","himself, grasped a limp shoulder, and rolled uppermost. He gripped the"
"x5230","unseen elbows near the ground. “I’ve got him!” screamed Kemp. “Help!"
"x5230","Help—hold! He’s down! Hold his feet!”"
"x5230",""
"x5230","In another second there was a simultaneous rush upon the struggle, and"
"x5230","a stranger coming into the road suddenly might have thought an"
"x5230","exceptionally savage game of Rugby football was in progress. And there"
"x5230","was no shouting after Kemp’s cry—only a sound of blows and feet and"
"x5230","heavy breathing."
"x5230",""
"x5230","Then came a mighty effort, and the Invisible Man threw off a couple of"
"x5230","his antagonists and rose to his knees. Kemp clung to him in front like"
"x5230","a hound to a stag, and a dozen hands gripped, clutched, and tore at the"
"x5230","Unseen. The tram conductor suddenly got the neck and shoulders and"
"x5230","lugged him back."
"x5230",""
"x5230","Down went the heap of struggling men again and rolled over. There was,"
"x5230","I am afraid, some savage kicking. Then suddenly a wild scream of"
"x5230","“Mercy! Mercy!” that died down swiftly to a sound like choking."
"x5230",""
"x5230","“Get back, you fools!” cried the muffled voice of Kemp, and there was a"
"x5230","vigorous shoving back of stalwart forms. “He’s hurt, I tell you. Stand"
"x5230","back!”"
"x5230",""
"x5230","There was a brief struggle to clear a space, and then the circle of"
"x5230","eager faces saw the doctor kneeling, as it seemed, fifteen inches in"
"x5230","the air, and holding invisible arms to the ground. Behind him a"
"x5230","constable gripped invisible ankles."
"x5230",""
"x5230","“Don’t you leave go of en,” cried the big navvy, holding a"
"x5230","blood-stained spade; “he’s shamming.”"
"x5230",""
"x5230","“He’s not shamming,” said the doctor, cautiously raising his knee; “and"
"x5230","I’ll hold him.” His face was bruised and already going red; he spoke"
"x5230","thickly because of a bleeding lip. He released one hand and seemed to"
"x5230","be feeling at the face. “The mouth’s all wet,” he said. And then, “Good"
"x5230","God!”"
"x5230",""
"x5230","He stood up abruptly and then knelt down on the ground by the side of"
"x5230","the thing unseen. There was a pushing and shuffling, a sound of heavy"
"x5230","feet as fresh people turned up to increase the pressure of the crowd."
"x5230","People now were coming out of the houses. The doors of the “Jolly"
"x5230","Cricketers” stood suddenly wide open. Very little was said."
"x5230",""
"x5230","Kemp felt about, his hand seeming to pass through empty air. “He’s not"
"x5230","breathing,” he said, and then, “I can’t feel his heart. His side—ugh!”"
"x5230",""
"x5230","Suddenly an old woman, peering under the arm of the big navvy, screamed"
"x5230","sharply. “Looky there!” she said, and thrust out a wrinkled finger."
"x5230",""
"x5230","And looking where she pointed, everyone saw, faint and transparent as"
"x5230","though it was made of glass, so that veins and arteries and bones and"
"x5230","nerves could be distinguished, the outline of a hand, a hand limp and"
"x5230","prone. It grew clouded and opaque even as they stared."

"x5230","“Hullo!” cried the constable. “Here’s his feet a-showing!”"

"x5230","And so, slowly, beginning at his hands and feet and creeping along his"
"x5230","limbs to the vital centres of his body, that strange change continued."
"x5230","It was like the slow spreading of a poison. First came the little white"
"x5230","nerves, a hazy grey sketch of a limb, then the glassy bones and"
"x5230","intricate arteries, then the flesh and skin, first a faint fogginess,"

"x5230","When at last the crowd made way for Kemp to stand erect, there lay,"
"x5230","naked and pitiful on the ground, the bruised and broken body of a young"

"x5230","white with the whiteness of albinism—and his eyes were like garnets."
