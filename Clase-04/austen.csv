"x121","ADVERTISEMENT BY THE AUTHORESS, TO NORTHANGER ABBEY"
"x121",""
"x121","THIS little work was finished in the year 1803, and intended for"
"x121","immediate publication. It was disposed of to a bookseller, it was even"
"x121","advertised, and why the business proceeded no farther, the author"
"x121","has never been able to learn. That any bookseller should think it"
"x121","worth-while to purchase what he did not think it worth-while to publish"
"x121","seems extraordinary. But with this, neither the author nor the public"
"x121","have any other concern than as some observation is necessary upon those"
"x121","parts of the work which thirteen years have made comparatively obsolete."
"x121","The public are entreated to bear in mind that thirteen years have passed"
"x121","since it was finished, many more since it was begun, and that during"
"x121","that period, places, manners, books, and opinions have undergone"
"x121","considerable changes."

"x121","CHAPTER 1"
"x121",""
"x121",""
"x121","No one who had ever seen Catherine Morland in her infancy would have"
"x121","supposed her born to be an heroine. Her situation in life, the character"
"x121","of her father and mother, her own person and disposition, were"
"x121","all equally against her. Her father was a clergyman, without being"
"x121","neglected, or poor, and a very respectable man, though his name"
"x121","was Richard--and he had never been handsome. He had a considerable"
"x121","independence besides two good livings--and he was not in the least"
"x121","addicted to locking up his daughters. Her mother was a woman of useful"
"x121","plain sense, with a good temper, and, what is more remarkable, with a"
"x121","good constitution. She had three sons before Catherine was born; and"
"x121","instead of dying in bringing the latter into the world, as anybody might"
"x121","expect, she still lived on--lived to have six children more--to see them"
"x121","growing up around her, and to enjoy excellent health herself. A family"
"x121","of ten children will be always called a fine family, where there are"
"x121","heads and arms and legs enough for the number; but the Morlands had"
"x121","little other right to the word, for they were in general very plain, and"
"x121","Catherine, for many years of her life, as plain as any. She had a thin"
"x121","awkward figure, a sallow skin without colour, dark lank hair, and strong"
"x121","features--so much for her person; and not less unpropitious for heroism"
"x121","seemed her mind. She was fond of all boy's plays, and greatly preferred"
"x121","cricket not merely to dolls, but to the more heroic enjoyments of"
"x121","infancy, nursing a dormouse, feeding a canary-bird, or watering a"
"x121","rose-bush. Indeed she had no taste for a garden; and if she gathered"
"x121","flowers at all, it was chiefly for the pleasure of mischief--at least"
"x121","so it was conjectured from her always preferring those which she was"
"x121","forbidden to take. Such were her propensities--her abilities were quite"
"x121","as extraordinary. She never could learn or understand anything"
"x121","before she was taught; and sometimes not even then, for she was often"
"x121","inattentive, and occasionally stupid. Her mother was three months in"
"x121","teaching her only to repeat the ""Beggar's Petition""; and after all, her"
"x121","next sister, Sally, could say it better than she did. Not that Catherine"
"x121","was always stupid--by no means; she learnt the fable of ""The Hare and"
"x121","Many Friends"" as quickly as any girl in England. Her mother wished her"
"x121","to learn music; and Catherine was sure she should like it, for she was"
"x121","very fond of tinkling the keys of the old forlorn spinnet; so, at eight"
"x121","years old she began. She learnt a year, and could not bear it; and Mrs."
"x121","Morland, who did not insist on her daughters being accomplished in"
"x121","spite of incapacity or distaste, allowed her to leave off. The day which"
"x121","dismissed the music-master was one of the happiest of Catherine's life."
"x121","Her taste for drawing was not superior; though whenever she could obtain"
"x121","the outside of a letter from her mother or seize upon any other odd"
"x121","piece of paper, she did what she could in that way, by drawing houses"
"x121","and trees, hens and chickens, all very much like one another. Writing"
"x121","and accounts she was taught by her father; French by her mother: her"
"x121","proficiency in either was not remarkable, and she shirked her lessons in"
"x121","both whenever she could. What a strange, unaccountable character!--for"
"x121","with all these symptoms of profligacy at ten years old, she had neither"
"x121","a bad heart nor a bad temper, was seldom stubborn, scarcely ever"
"x121","quarrelsome, and very kind to the little ones, with few interruptions"
"x121","of tyranny; she was moreover noisy and wild, hated confinement and"
"x121","cleanliness, and loved nothing so well in the world as rolling down the"
"x121","green slope at the back of the house."
"x121",""
"x121","Such was Catherine Morland at ten. At fifteen, appearances were mending;"
"x121","she began to curl her hair and long for balls; her complexion improved,"
"x121","her features were softened by plumpness and colour, her eyes gained more"
"x121","animation, and her figure more consequence. Her love of dirt gave way to"
"x121","an inclination for finery, and she grew clean as she grew smart; she had"
"x121","now the pleasure of sometimes hearing her father and mother remark"
"x121","on her personal improvement. ""Catherine grows quite a good-looking"
"x121","girl--she is almost pretty today,"" were words which caught her ears now"
"x121","and then; and how welcome were the sounds! To look almost pretty is an"
"x121","acquisition of higher delight to a girl who has been looking plain the"
"x121","first fifteen years of her life than a beauty from her cradle can ever"
"x121","receive."
"x121",""
"x121","Mrs. Morland was a very good woman, and wished to see her children"
"x121","everything they ought to be; but her time was so much occupied in"
"x121","lying-in and teaching the little ones, that her elder daughters were"
"x121","inevitably left to shift for themselves; and it was not very wonderful"
"x121","that Catherine, who had by nature nothing heroic about her, should"
"x121","prefer cricket, baseball, riding on horseback, and running about"
"x121","the country at the age of fourteen, to books--or at least books of"
"x121","information--for, provided that nothing like useful knowledge could be"
"x121","gained from them, provided they were all story and no reflection, she"
"x121","had never any objection to books at all. But from fifteen to seventeen"
"x121","she was in training for a heroine; she read all such works as heroines"
"x121","must read to supply their memories with those quotations which are so"
"x121","serviceable and so soothing in the vicissitudes of their eventful lives."
"x121",""
"x121","From Pope, she learnt to censure those who"
"x121",""
"x121","   ""bear about the mockery of woe."""
"x121",""
"x121",""
"x121","From Gray, that"
"x121",""
"x121","   ""Many a flower is born to blush unseen,"
"x121","   ""And waste its fragrance on the desert air."""
"x121",""
"x121",""
"x121","From Thompson, that--"
"x121",""
"x121","   ""It is a delightful task"
"x121","   ""To teach the young idea how to shoot."""
"x121",""
"x121",""
"x121","And from Shakespeare she gained a great store of information--amongst"
"x121","the rest, that--"
"x121",""
"x121","   ""Trifles light as air,"
"x121","   ""Are, to the jealous, confirmation strong,"
"x121","   ""As proofs of Holy Writ."""
"x121",""
"x121",""
"x121","That"
"x121",""
"x121","   ""The poor beetle, which we tread upon,"
"x121","   ""In corporal sufferance feels a pang as great"
"x121","   ""As when a giant dies."""
"x121",""
"x121",""
"x121","And that a young woman in love always looks--"
"x121",""
"x121","   ""like Patience on a monument"
"x121","   ""Smiling at Grief."""
"x121",""
"x121",""
"x121","So far her improvement was sufficient--and in many other points she came"
"x121","on exceedingly well; for though she could not write sonnets, she brought"
"x121","herself to read them; and though there seemed no chance of her throwing"
"x121","a whole party into raptures by a prelude on the pianoforte, of her own"
"x121","composition, she could listen to other people's performance with very"
"x121","little fatigue. Her greatest deficiency was in the pencil--she had no"
"x121","notion of drawing--not enough even to attempt a sketch of her lover's"
"x121","profile, that she might be detected in the design. There she fell"
"x121","miserably short of the true heroic height. At present she did not know"
"x121","her own poverty, for she had no lover to portray. She had reached the"
"x121","age of seventeen, without having seen one amiable youth who could call"
"x121","forth her sensibility, without having inspired one real passion, and"
"x121","without having excited even any admiration but what was very moderate"
"x121","and very transient. This was strange indeed! But strange things may be"
"x121","generally accounted for if their cause be fairly searched out. There was"
"x121","not one lord in the neighbourhood; no--not even a baronet. There was not"
"x121","one family among their acquaintance who had reared and supported a boy"
"x121","accidentally found at their door--not one young man whose origin"
"x121","was unknown. Her father had no ward, and the squire of the parish no"
"x121","children."
"x121",""
"x121","But when a young lady is to be a heroine, the perverseness of forty"
"x121","surrounding families cannot prevent her. Something must and will happen"
"x121","to throw a hero in her way."
"x121",""
"x121","Mr. Allen, who owned the chief of the property about Fullerton, the"
"x121","village in Wiltshire where the Morlands lived, was ordered to Bath"
"x121","for the benefit of a gouty constitution--and his lady, a good-humoured"
"x121","woman, fond of Miss Morland, and probably aware that if adventures will"
"x121","not befall a young lady in her own village, she must seek them abroad,"
"x121","invited her to go with them. Mr. and Mrs. Morland were all compliance,"
"x121","and Catherine all happiness."

"x121","CHAPTER 2"
"x121",""
"x121",""
"x121","In addition to what has been already said of Catherine Morland's"
"x121","personal and mental endowments, when about to be launched into all the"
"x121","difficulties and dangers of a six weeks' residence in Bath, it may be"
"x121","stated, for the reader's more certain information, lest the following"
"x121","pages should otherwise fail of giving any idea of what her character is"
"x121","meant to be, that her heart was affectionate; her disposition cheerful"
"x121","and open, without conceit or affectation of any kind--her manners just"
"x121","removed from the awkwardness and shyness of a girl; her person pleasing,"
"x121","and, when in good looks, pretty--and her mind about as ignorant and"
"x121","uninformed as the female mind at seventeen usually is."
"x121",""
"x121","When the hour of departure drew near, the maternal anxiety of Mrs."
"x121","Morland will be naturally supposed to be most severe. A thousand"
"x121","alarming presentiments of evil to her beloved Catherine from this"
"x121","terrific separation must oppress her heart with sadness, and drown her"
"x121","in tears for the last day or two of their being together; and advice of"
"x121","the most important and applicable nature must of course flow from her"
"x121","wise lips in their parting conference in her closet. Cautions against"
"x121","the violence of such noblemen and baronets as delight in forcing young"
"x121","ladies away to some remote farm-house, must, at such a moment, relieve"
"x121","the fulness of her heart. Who would not think so? But Mrs. Morland knew"
"x121","so little of lords and baronets, that she entertained no notion of their"
"x121","general mischievousness, and was wholly unsuspicious of danger to her"
"x121","daughter from their machinations. Her cautions were confined to the"
"x121","following points. ""I beg, Catherine, you will always wrap yourself up"
"x121","very warm about the throat, when you come from the rooms at night; and"
"x121","I wish you would try to keep some account of the money you spend; I will"
"x121","give you this little book on purpose."""
"x121",""
"x121","Sally, or rather Sarah (for what young lady of common gentility will"
"x121","reach the age of sixteen without altering her name as far as she can?),"
"x121","must from situation be at this time the intimate friend and confidante"
"x121","of her sister. It is remarkable, however, that she neither insisted"
"x121","on Catherine's writing by every post, nor exacted her promise of"
"x121","transmitting the character of every new acquaintance, nor a detail"
"x121","of every interesting conversation that Bath might produce. Everything"
"x121","indeed relative to this important journey was done, on the part of the"
"x121","Morlands, with a degree of moderation and composure, which seemed"
"x121","rather consistent with the common feelings of common life, than with the"
"x121","refined susceptibilities, the tender emotions which the first separation"
"x121","of a heroine from her family ought always to excite. Her father, instead"
"x121","of giving her an unlimited order on his banker, or even putting an"
"x121","hundred pounds bank-bill into her hands, gave her only ten guineas, and"
"x121","promised her more when she wanted it."
"x121",""
"x121","Under these unpromising auspices, the parting took place, and the"
"x121","journey began. It was performed with suitable quietness and uneventful"
"x121","safety. Neither robbers nor tempests befriended them, nor one lucky"
"x121","overturn to introduce them to the hero. Nothing more alarming occurred"
"x121","than a fear, on Mrs. Allen's side, of having once left her clogs behind"
"x121","her at an inn, and that fortunately proved to be groundless."
"x121",""
"x121","They arrived at Bath. Catherine was all eager delight--her eyes were"
"x121","here, there, everywhere, as they approached its fine and striking"
"x121","environs, and afterwards drove through those streets which conducted"
"x121","them to the hotel. She was come to be happy, and she felt happy already."
"x121",""
"x121","They were soon settled in comfortable lodgings in Pulteney Street."
"x121",""
"x121","It is now expedient to give some description of Mrs. Allen, that the"
"x121","reader may be able to judge in what manner her actions will hereafter"
"x121","tend to promote the general distress of the work, and how she will,"
"x121","probably, contribute to reduce poor Catherine to all the desperate"
"x121","wretchedness of which a last volume is capable--whether by her"
"x121","imprudence, vulgarity, or jealousy--whether by intercepting her letters,"
"x121","ruining her character, or turning her out of doors."
"x121",""
"x121","Mrs. Allen was one of that numerous class of females, whose society can"
"x121","raise no other emotion than surprise at there being any men in the world"
"x121","who could like them well enough to marry them. She had neither beauty,"
"x121","genius, accomplishment, nor manner. The air of a gentlewoman, a great"
"x121","deal of quiet, inactive good temper, and a trifling turn of mind"
"x121","were all that could account for her being the choice of a sensible,"
"x121","intelligent man like Mr. Allen. In one respect she was admirably fitted"
"x121","to introduce a young lady into public, being as fond of going everywhere"
"x121","and seeing everything herself as any young lady could be. Dress was"
"x121","her passion. She had a most harmless delight in being fine; and our"
"x121","heroine's entree into life could not take place till after three or four"
"x121","days had been spent in learning what was mostly worn, and her chaperone"
"x121","was provided with a dress of the newest fashion. Catherine too made"
"x121","some purchases herself, and when all these matters were arranged, the"
"x121","important evening came which was to usher her into the Upper Rooms. Her"
"x121","hair was cut and dressed by the best hand, her clothes put on with care,"
"x121","and both Mrs. Allen and her maid declared she looked quite as she should"
"x121","do. With such encouragement, Catherine hoped at least to pass uncensured"
"x121","through the crowd. As for admiration, it was always very welcome when it"
"x121","came, but she did not depend on it."
"x121",""
"x121","Mrs. Allen was so long in dressing that they did not enter the ballroom"
"x121","till late. The season was full, the room crowded, and the two ladies"
"x121","squeezed in as well as they could. As for Mr. Allen, he repaired"
"x121","directly to the card-room, and left them to enjoy a mob by themselves."
"x121","With more care for the safety of her new gown than for the comfort of"
"x121","her protegee, Mrs. Allen made her way through the throng of men by"
"x121","the door, as swiftly as the necessary caution would allow; Catherine,"
"x121","however, kept close at her side, and linked her arm too firmly within"
"x121","her friend's to be torn asunder by any common effort of a struggling"
"x121","assembly. But to her utter amazement she found that to proceed along the"
"x121","room was by no means the way to disengage themselves from the crowd; it"
"x121","seemed rather to increase as they went on, whereas she had imagined that"
"x121","when once fairly within the door, they should easily find seats and be"
"x121","able to watch the dances with perfect convenience. But this was far from"
"x121","being the case, and though by unwearied diligence they gained even the"
"x121","top of the room, their situation was just the same; they saw nothing"
"x121","of the dancers but the high feathers of some of the ladies. Still they"
"x121","moved on--something better was yet in view; and by a continued exertion"
"x121","of strength and ingenuity they found themselves at last in the passage"
"x121","behind the highest bench. Here there was something less of crowd than"
"x121","below; and hence Miss Morland had a comprehensive view of all the"
"x121","company beneath her, and of all the dangers of her late passage through"
"x121","them. It was a splendid sight, and she began, for the first time that"
"x121","evening, to feel herself at a ball: she longed to dance, but she had"
"x121","not an acquaintance in the room. Mrs. Allen did all that she could do"
"x121","in such a case by saying very placidly, every now and then, ""I wish you"
"x121","could dance, my dear--I wish you could get a partner."" For some time"
"x121","her young friend felt obliged to her for these wishes; but they were"
"x121","repeated so often, and proved so totally ineffectual, that Catherine"
"x121","grew tired at last, and would thank her no more."
"x121",""
"x121","They were not long able, however, to enjoy the repose of the eminence"
"x121","they had so laboriously gained. Everybody was shortly in motion for"
"x121","tea, and they must squeeze out like the rest. Catherine began to feel"
"x121","something of disappointment--she was tired of being continually pressed"
"x121","against by people, the generality of whose faces possessed nothing to"
"x121","interest, and with all of whom she was so wholly unacquainted that she"
"x121","could not relieve the irksomeness of imprisonment by the exchange of a"
"x121","syllable with any of her fellow captives; and when at last arrived in"
"x121","the tea-room, she felt yet more the awkwardness of having no party to"
"x121","join, no acquaintance to claim, no gentleman to assist them. They saw"
"x121","nothing of Mr. Allen; and after looking about them in vain for a more"
"x121","eligible situation, were obliged to sit down at the end of a table, at"
"x121","which a large party were already placed, without having anything to do"
"x121","there, or anybody to speak to, except each other."
"x121",""
"x121","Mrs. Allen congratulated herself, as soon as they were seated, on having"
"x121","preserved her gown from injury. ""It would have been very shocking to"
"x121","have it torn,"" said she, ""would not it? It is such a delicate muslin."
"x121","For my part I have not seen anything I like so well in the whole room, I"
"x121","assure you."""
"x121",""
"x121","""How uncomfortable it is,"" whispered Catherine, ""not to have a single"
"x121","acquaintance here!"""
"x121",""
"x121","""Yes, my dear,"" replied Mrs. Allen, with perfect serenity, ""it is very"
"x121","uncomfortable indeed."""

"x121","they wondered why we came here--we seem forcing ourselves into their"

"x121","""Aye, so we do. That is very disagreeable. I wish we had a large"

"x121",""
"x121","""I wish we had any--it would be somebody to go to."""
"x121",""
"x121","""Very true, my dear; and if we knew anybody we would join them directly."
"x121","The Skinners were here last year--I wish they were here now."""
"x121",""
"x121","""Had not we better go away as it is? Here are no tea-things for us, you"
"x121","see."""
"x121",""
"x121","""No more there are, indeed. How very provoking! But I think we had"
"x121","better sit still, for one gets so tumbled in such a crowd! How is my"
"x121","head, my dear? Somebody gave me a push that has hurt it, I am afraid."""
"x121",""
"x121","""No, indeed, it looks very nice. But, dear Mrs. Allen, are you sure"
"x121","there is nobody you know in all this multitude of people? I think you"
"x121","must know somebody."""
"x121",""
"x121","""I don't, upon my word--I wish I did. I wish I had a large acquaintance"
"x121","here with all my heart, and then I should get you a partner. I should be"
"x121","so glad to have you dance. There goes a strange-looking woman! What an"
"x121","odd gown she has got on! How old-fashioned it is! Look at the back."""
"x121",""
"x121","After some time they received an offer of tea from one of their"
"x121","neighbours; it was thankfully accepted, and this introduced a light"
"x121","conversation with the gentleman who offered it, which was the only time"
"x121","that anybody spoke to them during the evening, till they were discovered"
"x121","and joined by Mr. Allen when the dance was over."
"x121",""
"x121","""Well, Miss Morland,"" said he, directly, ""I hope you have had an"
"x121","agreeable ball."""
"x121",""
"x121","""Very agreeable indeed,"" she replied, vainly endeavouring to hide a"
"x121","great yawn."
"x121",""
"x121","""I wish she had been able to dance,"" said his wife; ""I wish we could"
"x121","have got a partner for her. I have been saying how glad I should be if"
"x121","the Skinners were here this winter instead of last; or if the Parrys had"
"x121","come, as they talked of once, she might have danced with George Parry. I"
"x121","am so sorry she has not had a partner!"""
"x121",""
"x121","""We shall do better another evening I hope,"" was Mr. Allen's"
"x121","consolation."
"x121",""
"x121","The company began to disperse when the dancing was over--enough to leave"
"x121","space for the remainder to walk about in some comfort; and now was the"
"x121","time for a heroine, who had not yet played a very distinguished part"
"x121","in the events of the evening, to be noticed and admired. Every five"
"x121","minutes, by removing some of the crowd, gave greater openings for her"
"x121","charms. She was now seen by many young men who had not been near her"
"x121","before. Not one, however, started with rapturous wonder on beholding"
"x121","her, no whisper of eager inquiry ran round the room, nor was she once"
"x121","called a divinity by anybody. Yet Catherine was in very good looks, and"
"x121","had the company only seen her three years before, they would now have"
"x121","thought her exceedingly handsome."
"x121",""
"x121","She was looked at, however, and with some admiration; for, in her own"
"x121","hearing, two gentlemen pronounced her to be a pretty girl. Such words"
"x121","had their due effect; she immediately thought the evening pleasanter"
"x121","than she had found it before--her humble vanity was contented--she"
"x121","felt more obliged to the two young men for this simple praise than a"
"x121","true-quality heroine would have been for fifteen sonnets in celebration"
"x121","of her charms, and went to her chair in good humour with everybody, and"
"x121","perfectly satisfied with her share of public attention."

"x121","They made their appearance in the Lower Rooms; and here fortune was more"
"x121","favourable to our heroine. The master of the ceremonies introduced to"
"x121","her a very gentlemanlike young man as a partner; his name was Tilney."
"x121","He seemed to be about four or five and twenty, was rather tall, had a"
"x121","pleasing countenance, a very intelligent and lively eye, and, if not"
"x121","quite handsome, was very near it. His address was good, and Catherine"
"x121","felt herself in high luck. There was little leisure for speaking"
"x121","while they danced; but when they were seated at tea, she found him as"
"x121","agreeable as she had already given him credit for being. He talked with"
"x121","fluency and spirit--and there was an archness and pleasantry in his"
"x121","manner which interested, though it was hardly understood by her. After"
"x121","chatting some time on such matters as naturally arose from the objects"
"x121","around them, he suddenly addressed her with--""I have hitherto been very"
"x121","remiss, madam, in the proper attentions of a partner here; I have not"
"x121","yet asked you how long you have been in Bath; whether you were ever here"
"x121","before; whether you have been at the Upper Rooms, the theatre, and"
"x121","the concert; and how you like the place altogether. I have been"

"x121",""
"x121","""Why, indeed!"" said he, in his natural tone. ""But some emotion must"

"x121","largely contributes to form the easy style of writing for which ladies"
"x121","are so generally celebrated. Everybody allows that the talent of writing"

"x121","was demanded--Mr. Tilney did not appear. Every creature in Bath,"
"x121","except himself, was to be seen in the room at different periods of the"
"x121","fashionable hours; crowds of people were every moment passing in and"
"x121","out, up the steps and down; people whom nobody cared about, and nobody"
"x121","wanted to see; and he only was absent. ""What a delightful place Bath"
"x121","is,"" said Mrs. Allen as they sat down near the great clock, after"
"x121","parading the room till they were tired; ""and how pleasant it would be if"
"x121","we had any acquaintance here."""
"x121",""
"x121","This sentiment had been uttered so often in vain that Mrs. Allen had no"

"x121","diligence our point would gain""; and the unwearied diligence with which"
"x121","she had every day wished for the same thing was at length to have its"

"x121","about her own age, who was sitting by her, and had been looking at her"

"x121","in these words: ""I think, madam, I cannot be mistaken; it is a long time"
"x121","since I had the pleasure of seeing you, but is not your name Allen?"""
"x121","This question answered, as it readily was, the stranger pronounced hers"
"x121","to be Thorpe; and Mrs. Allen immediately recognized the features of"
"x121","a former schoolfellow and intimate, whom she had seen only once since"
"x121","their respective marriages, and that many years ago. Their joy on this"
"x121","meeting was very great, as well it might, since they had been contented"
"x121","to know nothing of each other for the last fifteen years. Compliments"
"x121","on good looks now passed; and, after observing how time had slipped away"
"x121","since they were last together, how little they had thought of meeting in"
"x121","Bath, and what a pleasure it was to see an old friend, they proceeded to"
"x121","make inquiries and give intelligence as to their families, sisters, and"
"x121","cousins, talking both together, far more ready to give than to receive"
"x121","information, and each hearing very little of what the other said. Mrs."
"x121","Thorpe, however, had one great advantage as a talker, over Mrs. Allen,"
"x121","in a family of children; and when she expatiated on the talents of her"
"x121","sons, and the beauty of her daughters, when she related their different"
"x121","situations and views--that John was at Oxford, Edward at Merchant"
"x121","Taylors', and William at sea--and all of them more beloved and respected"
"x121","in their different station than any other three beings ever were, Mrs."
"x121","Allen had no similar information to give, no similar triumphs to press"
"x121","on the unwilling and unbelieving ear of her friend, and was forced to"
"x121","sit and appear to listen to all these maternal effusions, consoling"
"x121","herself, however, with the discovery, which her keen eye soon made, that"
"x121","the lace on Mrs. Thorpe's pelisse was not half so handsome as that on"
"x121","her own."
"x121",""
"x121","""Here come my dear girls,"" cried Mrs. Thorpe, pointing at three"
"x121","smart-looking females who, arm in arm, were then moving towards her. ""My"
"x121","dear Mrs. Allen, I long to introduce them; they will be so delighted"
"x121","to see you: the tallest is Isabella, my eldest; is not she a fine young"
"x121","woman? The others are very much admired too, but I believe Isabella is"
"x121","the handsomest."""
"x121",""
"x121","The Miss Thorpes were introduced; and Miss Morland, who had been for a"
"x121","short time forgotten, was introduced likewise. The name seemed to strike"
"x121","them all; and, after speaking to her with great civility, the eldest"
"x121","young lady observed aloud to the rest, ""How excessively like her brother"
"x121","Miss Morland is!"""
"x121",""
"x121","""The very picture of him indeed!"" cried the mother--and ""I should have"
"x121","known her anywhere for his sister!"" was repeated by them all, two or"
"x121","three times over. For a moment Catherine was surprised; but Mrs. Thorpe"
"x121","and her daughters had scarcely begun the history of their acquaintance"
"x121","with Mr. James Morland, before she remembered that her eldest brother"
"x121","had lately formed an intimacy with a young man of his own college, of"
"x121","the name of Thorpe; and that he had spent the last week of the Christmas"
"x121","vacation with his family, near London."
"x121",""
"x121","The whole being explained, many obliging things were said by the Miss"
"x121","Thorpes of their wish of being better acquainted with her; of being"
"x121","considered as already friends, through the friendship of their brothers,"
"x121","etc., which Catherine heard with pleasure, and answered with all the"
"x121","pretty expressions she could command; and, as the first proof of amity,"
"x121","she was soon invited to accept an arm of the eldest Miss Thorpe, and"
"x121","take a turn with her about the room. Catherine was delighted with this"
"x121","extension of her Bath acquaintance, and almost forgot Mr. Tilney while"
"x121","she talked to Miss Thorpe. Friendship is certainly the finest balm for"
"x121","the pangs of disappointed love."
"x121",""
"x121","Their conversation turned upon those subjects, of which the free"
"x121","discussion has generally much to do in perfecting a sudden intimacy"
"x121","between two young ladies: such as dress, balls, flirtations, and"
"x121","quizzes. Miss Thorpe, however, being four years older than Miss Morland,"
"x121","and at least four years better informed, had a very decided advantage in"
"x121","discussing such points; she could compare the balls of Bath with those"
"x121","of Tunbridge, its fashions with the fashions of London; could rectify"
"x121","the opinions of her new friend in many articles of tasteful attire;"
"x121","could discover a flirtation between any gentleman and lady who only"
"x121","smiled on each other; and point out a quiz through the thickness of a"
"x121","crowd. These powers received due admiration from Catherine, to whom they"
"x121","were entirely new; and the respect which they naturally inspired might"
"x121","have been too great for familiarity, had not the easy gaiety of Miss"
"x121","Thorpe's manners, and her frequent expressions of delight on this"
"x121","acquaintance with her, softened down every feeling of awe, and left"
"x121","nothing but tender affection. Their increasing attachment was not to be"
"x121","satisfied with half a dozen turns in the pump-room, but required, when"
"x121","they all quitted it together, that Miss Thorpe should accompany Miss"
"x121","Morland to the very door of Mr. Allen's house; and that they should"
"x121","there part with a most affectionate and lengthened shake of hands, after"
"x121","learning, to their mutual relief, that they should see each other across"
"x121","the theatre at night, and say their prayers in the same chapel the next"
"x121","morning. Catherine then ran directly upstairs, and watched Miss Thorpe's"
"x121","progress down the street from the drawing-room window; admired the"
"x121","graceful spirit of her walk, the fashionable air of her figure and"
"x121","dress; and felt grateful, as well she might, for the chance which had"
"x121","procured her such a friend."
"x121",""
"x121","Mrs. Thorpe was a widow, and not a very rich one; she was a"
"x121","good-humoured, well-meaning woman, and a very indulgent mother. Her"

"x121","dressing in the same style, did very well."

"x121",""
"x121","Catherine was not so much engaged at the theatre that evening, in"
"x121","returning the nods and smiles of Miss Thorpe, though they certainly"
"x121","claimed much of her leisure, as to forget to look with an inquiring eye"
"x121","for Mr. Tilney in every box which her eye could reach; but she looked in"
"x121","vain. Mr. Tilney was no fonder of the play than the pump-room. She hoped"
"x121","to be more fortunate the next day; and when her wishes for fine weather"
"x121","were answered by seeing a beautiful morning, she hardly felt a doubt of"
"x121","it; for a fine Sunday in Bath empties every house of its inhabitants,"
"x121","and all the world appears on such an occasion to walk about and tell"
"x121","their acquaintance what a charming day it is."
"x121",""
"x121","As soon as divine service was over, the Thorpes and Allens eagerly"
"x121","joined each other; and after staying long enough in the pump-room to"
"x121","discover that the crowd was insupportable, and that there was not"
"x121","a genteel face to be seen, which everybody discovers every Sunday"
"x121","throughout the season, they hastened away to the Crescent, to breathe"
"x121","the fresh air of better company. Here Catherine and Isabella, arm"
"x121","in arm, again tasted the sweets of friendship in an unreserved"
"x121","conversation; they talked much, and with much enjoyment; but again"
"x121","was Catherine disappointed in her hope of reseeing her partner. He was"
"x121","nowhere to be met with; every search for him was equally unsuccessful,"
"x121","in morning lounges or evening assemblies; neither at the Upper nor Lower"
"x121","Rooms, at dressed or undressed balls, was he perceivable; nor among the"
"x121","walkers, the horsemen, or the curricle-drivers of the morning. His name"
"x121","was not in the pump-room book, and curiosity could do no more. He must"
"x121","be gone from Bath. Yet he had not mentioned that his stay would be so"
"x121","short! This sort of mysteriousness, which is always so becoming in a"
"x121","hero, threw a fresh grace in Catherine's imagination around his person"
"x121","and manners, and increased her anxiety to know more of him. From the"
"x121","Thorpes she could learn nothing, for they had been only two days in Bath"
"x121","before they met with Mrs. Allen. It was a subject, however, in which"
"x121","she often indulged with her fair friend, from whom she received every"
"x121","possible encouragement to continue to think of him; and his impression"
"x121","on her fancy was not suffered therefore to weaken. Isabella was very"
"x121","sure that he must be a charming young man, and was equally sure that he"
"x121","must have been delighted with her dear Catherine, and would therefore"
"x121","shortly return. She liked him the better for being a clergyman, ""for she"
"x121","must confess herself very partial to the profession""; and something like"
"x121","a sigh escaped her as she said it. Perhaps Catherine was wrong in not"
"x121","demanding the cause of that gentle emotion--but she was not experienced"
"x121","enough in the finesse of love, or the duties of friendship, to know when"
"x121","delicate raillery was properly called for, or when a confidence should"
"x121","be forced."
"x121",""
"x121","Mrs. Allen was now quite happy--quite satisfied with Bath. She had found"
"x121","some acquaintance, had been so lucky too as to find in them the family"
"x121","of a most worthy old friend; and, as the completion of good fortune, had"
"x121","found these friends by no means so expensively dressed as herself. Her"
"x121","daily expressions were no longer, ""I wish we had some acquaintance in"
"x121","Bath!"" They were changed into, ""How glad I am we have met with Mrs."
"x121","Thorpe!"" and she was as eager in promoting the intercourse of the two"
"x121","families, as her young charge and Isabella themselves could be; never"
"x121","satisfied with the day unless she spent the chief of it by the side of"
"x121","Mrs. Thorpe, in what they called conversation, but in which there was"
"x121","scarcely ever any exchange of opinion, and not often any resemblance of"
"x121","subject, for Mrs. Thorpe talked chiefly of her children, and Mrs. Allen"
"x121","of her gowns."
"x121",""
"x121","The progress of the friendship between Catherine and Isabella was quick"
"x121","as its beginning had been warm, and they passed so rapidly through every"
"x121","gradation of increasing tenderness that there was shortly no fresh proof"
"x121","of it to be given to their friends or themselves. They called each other"
"x121","by their Christian name, were always arm in arm when they walked, pinned"
"x121","up each other's train for the dance, and were not to be divided in the"
"x121","set; and if a rainy morning deprived them of other enjoyments, they"
"x121","were still resolute in meeting in defiance of wet and dirt, and shut"
"x121","themselves up, to read novels together. Yes, novels; for I will not"
"x121","adopt that ungenerous and impolitic custom so common with novel-writers,"
"x121","of degrading by their contemptuous censure the very performances, to the"
"x121","number of which they are themselves adding--joining with their greatest"
"x121","enemies in bestowing the harshest epithets on such works, and scarcely"
"x121","ever permitting them to be read by their own heroine, who, if she"
"x121","accidentally take up a novel, is sure to turn over its insipid pages"
"x121","with disgust. Alas! If the heroine of one novel be not patronized by the"
"x121","heroine of another, from whom can she expect protection and regard? I"
"x121","cannot approve of it. Let us leave it to the reviewers to abuse such"
"x121","effusions of fancy at their leisure, and over every new novel to talk in"
"x121","threadbare strains of the trash with which the press now groans. Let us"
"x121","not desert one another; we are an injured body. Although our productions"
"x121","have afforded more extensive and unaffected pleasure than those of any"
"x121","other literary corporation in the world, no species of composition has"
"x121","been so much decried. From pride, ignorance, or fashion, our foes"
"x121","are almost as many as our readers. And while the abilities of the"
"x121","nine-hundredth abridger of the History of England, or of the man who"
"x121","collects and publishes in a volume some dozen lines of Milton, Pope, and"
"x121","Prior, with a paper from the Spectator, and a chapter from Sterne,"
"x121","are eulogized by a thousand pens--there seems almost a general wish of"
"x121","decrying the capacity and undervaluing the labour of the novelist, and"
"x121","of slighting the performances which have only genius, wit, and taste to"
"x121","recommend them. ""I am no novel-reader--I seldom look into novels--Do not"
"x121","imagine that I often read novels--It is really very well for a novel."""
"x121","Such is the common cant. ""And what are you reading, Miss--?"" ""Oh! It is"
"x121","only a novel!"" replies the young lady, while she lays down her book"
"x121","with affected indifference, or momentary shame. ""It is only Cecilia, or"
"x121","Camilla, or Belinda""; or, in short, only some work in which the greatest"
"x121","powers of the mind are displayed, in which the most thorough knowledge"
"x121","of human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties, the"
"x121","liveliest effusions of wit and humour, are conveyed to the world in the"
"x121","best-chosen language. Now, had the same young lady been engaged with a"
"x121","volume of the Spectator, instead of such a work, how proudly would she"
"x121","have produced the book, and told its name; though the chances must be"
"x121","against her being occupied by any part of that voluminous publication,"
"x121","of which either the matter or manner would not disgust a young person of"
"x121","taste: the substance of its papers so often consisting in the statement"
"x121","of improbable circumstances, unnatural characters, and topics of"
"x121","conversation which no longer concern anyone living; and their language,"

"x121","Milsom Street just now--very like yours, only with coquelicot ribbons"

"x121","sister and whispered, ""My dear creature, I am afraid I must leave you,"
"x121","your brother is so amazingly impatient to begin; I know you will not"

"x121","Thorpe and Mrs. Allen, between whom she now remained. She could not help"
"x121","being vexed at the non-appearance of Mr. Thorpe, for she not only longed"
"x121","to be dancing, but was likewise aware that, as the real dignity of her"
"x121","situation could not be known, she was sharing with the scores of other"
"x121","young ladies still sitting down all the discredit of wanting a partner."
"x121","To be disgraced in the eye of the world, to wear the appearance of"
"x121","infamy while her heart is all purity, her actions all innocence, and the"
"x121","misconduct of another the true source of her debasement, is one of those"
"x121","circumstances which peculiarly belong to the heroine's life, and her"
"x121","fortitude under it what particularly dignifies her character. Catherine"
"x121","had fortitude too; she suffered, but no murmur passed her lips."

"x121","From this state of humiliation, she was roused, at the end of ten"
"x121","minutes, to a pleasanter feeling, by seeing, not Mr. Thorpe, but Mr."
"x121","Tilney, within three yards of the place where they sat; he seemed to be"
"x121","moving that way, but he did not see her, and therefore the smile and the"
"x121","blush, which his sudden reappearance raised in Catherine, passed away"
"x121","without sullying her heroic importance. He looked as handsome and as"
"x121","lively as ever, and was talking with interest to a fashionable and"
"x121","pleasing-looking young woman, who leant on his arm, and whom Catherine"
"x121","immediately guessed to be his sister; thus unthinkingly throwing away"
"x121","a fair opportunity of considering him lost to her forever, by being"
"x121","married already. But guided only by what was simple and probable, it"
"x121","had never entered her head that Mr. Tilney could be married; he had not"
"x121","behaved, he had not talked, like the married men to whom she had been"
"x121","used; he had never mentioned a wife, and he had acknowledged a sister."
"x121","From these circumstances sprang the instant conclusion of his sister's"
"x121","now being by his side; and therefore, instead of turning of a deathlike"
"x121","paleness and falling in a fit on Mrs. Allen's bosom, Catherine sat"
"x121","erect, in the perfect use of her senses, and with cheeks only a little"
"x121","redder than usual."

"x121","should not complain, for it is so very agreeable a place, that it is"

"x121","him he is quite in luck to be sent here for his health."""

"x121","done, Mr. Tilney still continuing standing before them; and after a"
"x121","few minutes' consideration, he asked Catherine to dance with him. This"
"x121","compliment, delightful as it was, produced severe mortification to the"
"x121","lady; and in giving her denial, she expressed her sorrow on the occasion"
"x121","so very much as if she really felt it that had Thorpe, who joined her"
"x121","just afterwards, been half a minute earlier, he might have thought her"
"x121","sufferings rather too acute. The very easy manner in which he then told"
"x121","her that he had kept her waiting did not by any means reconcile her more"
"x121","to her lot; nor did the particulars which he entered into while they"
"x121","were standing up, of the horses and dogs of the friend whom he had just"
"x121","left, and of a proposed exchange of terriers between them, interest her"
"x121","so much as to prevent her looking very often towards that part of the"
"x121","room where she had left Mr. Tilney. Of her dear Isabella, to whom she"
"x121","particularly longed to point out that gentleman, she could see nothing."
"x121","They were in different sets. She was separated from all her party, and"
"x121","away from all her acquaintance; one mortification succeeded another,"
"x121","and from the whole she deduced this useful lesson, that to go previously"
"x121","engaged to a ball does not necessarily increase either the dignity or"
"x121","enjoyment of a young lady. From such a moralizing strain as this, she"
"x121","was suddenly roused by a touch on the shoulder, and turning round,"
"x121","perceived Mrs. Hughes directly behind her, attended by Miss Tilney and"
"x121","a gentleman. ""I beg your pardon, Miss Morland,"" said she, ""for this"
"x121","liberty--but I cannot anyhow get to Miss Thorpe, and Mrs. Thorpe said"
"x121","she was sure you would not have the least objection to letting in this"
"x121","young lady by you."" Mrs. Hughes could not have applied to any creature"
"x121","in the room more happy to oblige her than Catherine. The young ladies"
"x121","were introduced to each other, Miss Tilney expressing a proper sense of"
"x121","such goodness, Miss Morland with the real delicacy of a generous mind"
"x121","making light of the obligation; and Mrs. Hughes, satisfied with having"
"x121","so respectably settled her young charge, returned to her party."
"x121",""
"x121","Miss Tilney had a good figure, a pretty face, and a very agreeable"
"x121","countenance; and her air, though it had not all the decided pretension,"
"x121","the resolute stylishness of Miss Thorpe's, had more real elegance. Her"
"x121","manners showed good sense and good breeding; they were neither shy nor"
"x121","affectedly open; and she seemed capable of being young, attractive, and"
"x121","at a ball without wanting to fix the attention of every man near her,"
"x121","and without exaggerated feelings of ecstatic delight or inconceivable"
"x121","vexation on every little trifling occurrence. Catherine, interested at"
"x121","once by her appearance and her relationship to Mr. Tilney, was desirous"
"x121","of being acquainted with her, and readily talked therefore whenever she"
"x121","could think of anything to say, and had courage and leisure for saying"
"x121","it. But the hindrance thrown in the way of a very speedy intimacy, by"
"x121","the frequent want of one or more of these requisites, prevented their"
"x121","doing more than going through the first rudiments of an acquaintance, by"
"x121","informing themselves how well the other liked Bath, how much she admired"

"x121","sang, and whether she was fond of riding on horseback."

"x121","CHAPTER 9"
"x121",""
"x121",""
"x121","The progress of Catherine's unhappiness from the events of the evening"
"x121","was as follows. It appeared first in a general dissatisfaction with"
"x121","everybody about her, while she remained in the rooms, which speedily"
"x121","brought on considerable weariness and a violent desire to go home. This,"
"x121","on arriving in Pulteney Street, took the direction of extraordinary"
"x121","hunger, and when that was appeased, changed into an earnest longing to"
"x121","be in bed; such was the extreme point of her distress; for when there"
"x121","she immediately fell into a sound sleep which lasted nine hours, and"
"x121","from which she awoke perfectly revived, in excellent spirits, with fresh"
"x121","hopes and fresh schemes. The first wish of her heart was to improve her"
"x121","acquaintance with Miss Tilney, and almost her first resolution, to seek"
"x121","her for that purpose, in the pump-room at noon. In the pump-room, one"
"x121","so newly arrived in Bath must be met with, and that building she had"
"x121","already found so favourable for the discovery of female excellence,"
"x121","and the completion of female intimacy, so admirably adapted for secret"
"x121","discourses and unlimited confidence, that she was most reasonably"
"x121","encouraged to expect another friend from within its walls. Her plan"
"x121","for the morning thus settled, she sat quietly down to her book after"
"x121","breakfast, resolving to remain in the same place and the same employment"
"x121","till the clock struck one; and from habitude very little incommoded by"
"x121","the remarks and ejaculations of Mrs. Allen, whose vacancy of mind and"
"x121","incapacity for thinking were such, that as she never talked a great"
"x121","deal, so she could never be entirely silent; and, therefore, while she"
"x121","sat at her work, if she lost her needle or broke her thread, if she"
"x121","heard a carriage in the street, or saw a speck upon her gown, she must"
"x121","observe it aloud, whether there were anyone at leisure to answer her or"
"x121","not. At about half past twelve, a remarkably loud rap drew her in haste"
"x121","to the window, and scarcely had she time to inform Catherine of there"
"x121","being two open carriages at the door, in the first only a servant,"
"x121","her brother driving Miss Thorpe in the second, before John Thorpe came"
"x121","running upstairs, calling out, ""Well, Miss Morland, here I am. Have"
"x121","you been waiting long? We could not come before; the old devil of a"
"x121","coachmaker was such an eternity finding out a thing fit to be got into,"
"x121","and now it is ten thousand to one but they break down before we are out"
"x121","of the street. How do you do, Mrs. Allen? A famous ball last night, was"
"x121","not it? Come, Miss Morland, be quick, for the others are in a confounded"
"x121","hurry to be off. They want to get their tumble over."""
"x121",""
"x121","""What do you mean?"" said Catherine. ""Where are you all going to?"""
"x121",""
"x121","""Going to? Why, you have not forgot our engagement! Did not we agree"
"x121","together to take a drive this morning? What a head you have! We are"
"x121","going up Claverton Down."""
"x121",""
"x121","""Something was said about it, I remember,"" said Catherine, looking at"
"x121","Mrs. Allen for her opinion; ""but really I did not expect you."""
"x121",""
"x121","""Not expect me! That's a good one! And what a dust you would have made,"
"x121","if I had not come."""
"x121",""
"x121","Catherine's silent appeal to her friend, meanwhile, was entirely thrown"
"x121","away, for Mrs. Allen, not being at all in the habit of conveying any"
"x121","expression herself by a look, was not aware of its being ever intended"
"x121","by anybody else; and Catherine, whose desire of seeing Miss Tilney again"
"x121","could at that moment bear a short delay in favour of a drive, and who"
"x121","thought there could be no impropriety in her going with Mr. Thorpe, as"
"x121","Isabella was going at the same time with James, was therefore obliged to"
"x121","speak plainer. ""Well, ma'am, what do you say to it? Can you spare me for"
"x121","an hour or two? Shall I go?"""
"x121",""
"x121","""Do just as you please, my dear,"" replied Mrs. Allen, with the most"
"x121","placid indifference. Catherine took the advice, and ran off to get"
"x121","ready. In a very few minutes she reappeared, having scarcely allowed"
"x121","the two others time enough to get through a few short sentences in her"
"x121","praise, after Thorpe had procured Mrs. Allen's admiration of his gig;"
"x121","and then receiving her friend's parting good wishes, they both hurried"
"x121","downstairs. ""My dearest creature,"" cried Isabella, to whom the duty"
"x121","of friendship immediately called her before she could get into the"
"x121","carriage, ""you have been at least three hours getting ready. I was"
"x121","afraid you were ill. What a delightful ball we had last night. I have a"
"x121","thousand things to say to you; but make haste and get in, for I long to"
"x121","be off."""
"x121",""
"x121","Catherine followed her orders and turned away, but not too soon to hear"
"x121","her friend exclaim aloud to James, ""What a sweet girl she is! I quite"
"x121","dote on her."""
"x121",""
"x121","""You will not be frightened, Miss Morland,"" said Thorpe, as he handed"
"x121","her in, ""if my horse should dance about a little at first setting off."
"x121","He will, most likely, give a plunge or two, and perhaps take the rest"
"x121","for a minute; but he will soon know his master. He is full of spirits,"
"x121","playful as can be, but there is no vice in him."""
"x121",""
"x121","Catherine did not think the portrait a very inviting one, but it was too"
"x121","late to retreat, and she was too young to own herself frightened; so,"
"x121","resigning herself to her fate, and trusting to the animal's boasted"
"x121","knowledge of its owner, she sat peaceably down, and saw Thorpe sit down"
"x121","by her. Everything being then arranged, the servant who stood at the"
"x121","horse's head was bid in an important voice ""to let him go,"" and off they"
"x121","went in the quietest manner imaginable, without a plunge or a caper, or"
"x121","anything like one. Catherine, delighted at so happy an escape, spoke"
"x121","her pleasure aloud with grateful surprise; and her companion immediately"
"x121","made the matter perfectly simple by assuring her that it was entirely"
"x121","owing to the peculiarly judicious manner in which he had then held the"
"x121","reins, and the singular discernment and dexterity with which he had"
"x121","directed his whip. Catherine, though she could not help wondering that"
"x121","with such perfect command of his horse, he should think it necessary to"
"x121","alarm her with a relation of its tricks, congratulated herself sincerely"
"x121","on being under the care of so excellent a coachman; and perceiving that"
"x121","the animal continued to go on in the same quiet manner, without"
"x121","showing the smallest propensity towards any unpleasant vivacity, and"
"x121","(considering its inevitable pace was ten miles an hour) by no means"
"x121","alarmingly fast, gave herself up to all the enjoyment of air and"
"x121","exercise of the most invigorating kind, in a fine mild day of February,"
"x121","with the consciousness of safety. A silence of several minutes succeeded"
"x121","their first short dialogue; it was broken by Thorpe's saying very"
"x121","abruptly, ""Old Allen is as rich as a Jew--is not he?"" Catherine did not"
"x121","understand him--and he repeated his question, adding in explanation,"
"x121","""Old Allen, the man you are with."""
"x121",""
"x121","""Oh! Mr. Allen, you mean. Yes, I believe, he is very rich."""

"x121","""Yes, very much."""

"x121","""Aye, that is what I meant. He seems a good kind of old fellow enough,"

"x121",""
"x121","""His bottle a day! No. Why should you think of such a thing? He is a"

"x121",""
"x121","""Lord help you! You women are always thinking of men's being in liquor."
"x121","Why, you do not suppose a man is overset by a bottle? I am sure of"
"x121","this--that if everybody was to drink their bottle a day, there would not"

"x121","""And yet I have heard that there is a great deal of wine drunk in"
"x121","Oxford."""
"x121",""
"x121","""Oxford! There is no drinking at Oxford now, I assure you. Nobody drinks"
"x121","there. You would hardly meet with a man who goes beyond his four pints"
"x121","at the utmost. Now, for instance, it was reckoned a remarkable thing, at"
"x121","the last party in my rooms, that upon an average we cleared about five"
"x121","pints a head. It was looked upon as something out of the common way."
"x121","Mine is famous good stuff, to be sure. You would not often meet with"
"x121","anything like it in Oxford--and that may account for it. But this will"
"x121","just give you a notion of the general rate of drinking there."""
"x121",""
"x121","""Yes, it does give a notion,"" said Catherine warmly, ""and that is, that"
"x121","you all drink a great deal more wine than I thought you did. However, I"
"x121","am sure James does not drink so much."""
"x121",""
"x121","This declaration brought on a loud and overpowering reply, of which"
"x121","no part was very distinct, except the frequent exclamations, amounting"
"x121","almost to oaths, which adorned it, and Catherine was left, when it"
"x121","ended, with rather a strengthened belief of there being a great deal"
"x121","of wine drunk in Oxford, and the same happy conviction of her brother's"
"x121","comparative sobriety."
"x121",""
"x121","Thorpe's ideas then all reverted to the merits of his own equipage, and"
"x121","she was called on to admire the spirit and freedom with which his horse"
"x121","moved along, and the ease which his paces, as well as the excellence of"
"x121","the springs, gave the motion of the carriage. She followed him in all"
"x121","his admiration as well as she could. To go before or beyond him was"
"x121","impossible. His knowledge and her ignorance of the subject, his rapidity"
"x121","of expression, and her diffidence of herself put that out of her power;"
"x121","she could strike out nothing new in commendation, but she readily echoed"
"x121","whatever he chose to assert, and it was finally settled between them"
"x121","without any difficulty that his equipage was altogether the most"
"x121","complete of its kind in England, his carriage the neatest, his horse the"
"x121","best goer, and himself the best coachman. ""You do not really think,"
"x121","Mr. Thorpe,"" said Catherine, venturing after some time to consider the"
"x121","matter as entirely decided, and to offer some little variation on the"
"x121","subject, ""that James's gig will break down?"""
"x121",""
"x121","""Break down! Oh! Lord! Did you ever see such a little tittuppy thing in"

"x121","been fairly worn out these ten years at least--and as for the body! Upon"
"x121","my soul, you might shake it to pieces yourself with a touch. It is the"
"x121","most devilish little rickety business I ever beheld! Thank God! we"
"x121","have got a better. I would not be bound to go two miles in it for fifty"
"x121","thousand pounds."""
"x121",""
"x121","""Good heavens!"" cried Catherine, quite frightened. ""Then pray let us"
"x121","turn back; they will certainly meet with an accident if we go on. Do let"
"x121","us turn back, Mr. Thorpe; stop and speak to my brother, and tell him how"
"x121","very unsafe it is."""
"x121",""
"x121","""Unsafe! Oh, lord! What is there in that? They will only get a roll if"
"x121","it does break down; and there is plenty of dirt; it will be excellent"
"x121","falling. Oh, curse it! The carriage is safe enough, if a man knows how"
"x121","to drive it; a thing of that sort in good hands will last above twenty"
"x121","years after it is fairly worn out. Lord bless you! I would undertake for"
"x121","five pounds to drive it to York and back again, without losing a nail."""
"x121",""
"x121","Catherine listened with astonishment; she knew not how to reconcile two"
"x121","such very different accounts of the same thing; for she had not been"
"x121","brought up to understand the propensities of a rattle, nor to know to"
"x121","how many idle assertions and impudent falsehoods the excess of vanity"
"x121","will lead. Her own family were plain, matter-of-fact people who seldom"
"x121","aimed at wit of any kind; her father, at the utmost, being contented"
"x121","with a pun, and her mother with a proverb; they were not in the habit"
"x121","therefore of telling lies to increase their importance, or of asserting"
"x121","at one moment what they would contradict the next. She reflected on the"
"x121","affair for some time in much perplexity, and was more than once on the"
"x121","point of requesting from Mr. Thorpe a clearer insight into his real"
"x121","opinion on the subject; but she checked herself, because it appeared to"
"x121","her that he did not excel in giving those clearer insights, in making"
"x121","those things plain which he had before made ambiguous; and, joining to"
"x121","this, the consideration that he would not really suffer his sister and"
"x121","his friend to be exposed to a danger from which he might easily preserve"
"x121","them, she concluded at last that he must know the carriage to be in fact"
"x121","perfectly safe, and therefore would alarm herself no longer. By him"
"x121","the whole matter seemed entirely forgotten; and all the rest of his"
"x121","conversation, or rather talk, began and ended with himself and his own"
"x121","concerns. He told her of horses which he had bought for a trifle and"
"x121","sold for incredible sums; of racing matches, in which his judgment had"
"x121","infallibly foretold the winner; of shooting parties, in which he had"
"x121","killed more birds (though without having one good shot) than all his"
"x121","companions together; and described to her some famous day's sport, with"
"x121","the fox-hounds, in which his foresight and skill in directing the dogs"
"x121","had repaired the mistakes of the most experienced huntsman, and in which"
"x121","the boldness of his riding, though it had never endangered his own life"
"x121","for a moment, had been constantly leading others into difficulties,"
"x121","which he calmly concluded had broken the necks of many."

"x121","Little as Catherine was in the habit of judging for herself, and unfixed"
"x121","as were her general notions of what men ought to be, she could not"
"x121","entirely repress a doubt, while she bore with the effusions of his"
"x121","endless conceit, of his being altogether completely agreeable. It was a"
"x121","bold surmise, for he was Isabella's brother; and she had been assured by"
"x121","James that his manners would recommend him to all her sex; but in spite"
"x121","of this, the extreme weariness of his company, which crept over her"
"x121","before they had been out an hour, and which continued unceasingly to"
"x121","increase till they stopped in Pulteney Street again, induced her, in"
"x121","some small degree, to resist such high authority, and to distrust his"
"x121","powers of giving universal pleasure."
"x121",""
"x121","When they arrived at Mrs. Allen's door, the astonishment of Isabella was"
"x121","hardly to be expressed, on finding that it was too late in the day for"
"x121","them to attend her friend into the house: ""Past three o'clock!"" It was"
"x121","inconceivable, incredible, impossible! And she would neither believe her"
"x121","own watch, nor her brother's, nor the servant's; she would believe no"
"x121","assurance of it founded on reason or reality, till Morland produced his"
"x121","watch, and ascertained the fact; to have doubted a moment longer then"
"x121","would have been equally inconceivable, incredible, and impossible; and"
"x121","she could only protest, over and over again, that no two hours and a"
"x121","half had ever gone off so swiftly before, as Catherine was called on to"
"x121","confirm; Catherine could not tell a falsehood even to please Isabella;"
"x121","but the latter was spared the misery of her friend's dissenting voice,"
"x121","by not waiting for her answer. Her own feelings entirely engrossed"
"x121","her; her wretchedness was most acute on finding herself obliged to go"
"x121","directly home. It was ages since she had had a moment's conversation"
"x121","with her dearest Catherine; and, though she had such thousands of things"
"x121","to say to her, it appeared as if they were never to be together again;"
"x121","so, with smiles of most exquisite misery, and the laughing eye of utter"
"x121","despondency, she bade her friend adieu and went on."

"x121","Catherine's resolution of endeavouring to meet Miss Tilney again"
"x121","continued in full force the next morning; and till the usual moment of"
"x121","going to the pump-room, she felt some alarm from the dread of a second"
"x121","prevention. But nothing of that kind occurred, no visitors appeared to"
"x121","delay them, and they all three set off in good time for the pump-room,"
"x121","where the ordinary course of events and conversation took place; Mr."
"x121","Allen, after drinking his glass of water, joined some gentlemen to"
"x121","talk over the politics of the day and compare the accounts of their"
"x121","newspapers; and the ladies walked about together, noticing every new"
"x121","face, and almost every new bonnet in the room. The female part of the"
"x121","Thorpe family, attended by James Morland, appeared among the crowd in"
"x121","less than a quarter of an hour, and Catherine immediately took her"
"x121","usual place by the side of her friend. James, who was now in constant"
"x121","attendance, maintained a similar position, and separating themselves"
"x121","from the rest of their party, they walked in that manner for some"
"x121","time, till Catherine began to doubt the happiness of a situation which,"
"x121","confining her entirely to her friend and brother, gave her very"
"x121","little share in the notice of either. They were always engaged in"
"x121","some sentimental discussion or lively dispute, but their sentiment was"
"x121","conveyed in such whispering voices, and their vivacity attended with"
"x121","so much laughter, that though Catherine's supporting opinion was not"
"x121","unfrequently called for by one or the other, she was never able to give"
"x121","any, from not having heard a word of the subject. At length however"
"x121","she was empowered to disengage herself from her friend, by the avowed"
"x121","necessity of speaking to Miss Tilney, whom she most joyfully saw just"
"x121","entering the room with Mrs. Hughes, and whom she instantly joined, with"
"x121","a firmer determination to be acquainted, than she might have had courage"
"x121","to command, had she not been urged by the disappointment of the day"
"x121","before. Miss Tilney met her with great civility, returned her advances"
"x121","with equal goodwill, and they continued talking together as long as"
"x121","both parties remained in the room; and though in all probability not"
"x121","an observation was made, nor an expression used by either which had not"
"x121","been made and used some thousands of times before, under that roof, in"
"x121","every Bath season, yet the merit of their being spoken with simplicity"
"x121","and truth, and without personal conceit, might be something uncommon."
"x121",""
"x121","""How well your brother dances!"" was an artless exclamation of"

"x121",""
"x121","""Perhaps we--Yes, I think we certainly shall."""

"x121","smallest consciousness of having explained them."
"x121",""
"x121","She went home very happy. The morning had answered all her hopes, and"
"x121","the evening of the following day was now the object of expectation,"
"x121","the future good. What gown and what head-dress she should wear on the"
"x121","occasion became her chief concern. She cannot be justified in it. Dress"
"x121","is at all times a frivolous distinction, and excessive solicitude about"
"x121","it often destroys its own aim. Catherine knew all this very well; her"
"x121","great aunt had read her a lecture on the subject only the Christmas"
"x121","before; and yet she lay awake ten minutes on Wednesday night debating"
"x121","between her spotted and her tamboured muslin, and nothing but the"
"x121","shortness of the time prevented her buying a new one for the evening."
"x121","This would have been an error in judgment, great though not uncommon,"
"x121","from which one of the other sex rather than her own, a brother rather"
"x121","than a great aunt, might have warned her, for man only can be aware of"
"x121","the insensibility of man towards a new gown. It would be mortifying to"
"x121","the feelings of many ladies, could they be made to understand how little"
"x121","the heart of man is affected by what is costly or new in their attire;"
"x121","how little it is biased by the texture of their muslin, and how"
"x121","unsusceptible of peculiar tenderness towards the spotted, the sprigged,"
"x121","the mull, or the jackonet. Woman is fine for her own satisfaction alone."
"x121","No man will admire her the more, no woman will like her the better for"
"x121","it. Neatness and fashion are enough for the former, and a something of"
"x121","shabbiness or impropriety will be most endearing to the latter. But not"
"x121","one of these grave reflections troubled the tranquillity of Catherine."
"x121",""
"x121","She entered the rooms on Thursday evening with feelings very different"
"x121","from what had attended her thither the Monday before. She had then been"
"x121","exulting in her engagement to Thorpe, and was now chiefly anxious to"
"x121","avoid his sight, lest he should engage her again; for though she could"
"x121","not, dared not expect that Mr. Tilney should ask her a third time to"
"x121","dance, her wishes, hopes, and plans all centred in nothing less. Every"
"x121","young lady may feel for my heroine in this critical moment, for every"
"x121","young lady has at some time or other known the same agitation. All have"
"x121","been, or at least all have believed themselves to be, in danger from the"
"x121","pursuit of someone whom they wished to avoid; and all have been anxious"
"x121","for the attentions of someone whom they wished to please. As soon as"
"x121","they were joined by the Thorpes, Catherine's agony began; she fidgeted"
"x121","about if John Thorpe came towards her, hid herself as much as possible"
"x121","from his view, and when he spoke to her pretended not to hear him. The"
"x121","cotillions were over, the country-dancing beginning, and she saw nothing"
"x121","of the Tilneys."
"x121",""
"x121","""Do not be frightened, my dear Catherine,"" whispered Isabella, ""but I am"
"x121","really going to dance with your brother again. I declare positively it"
"x121","is quite shocking. I tell him he ought to be ashamed of himself, but you"

"x121","by Mr. Tilney himself. With what sparkling eyes and ready motion she"

"x121","Catherine's feelings, as she got into the carriage, were in a very"

"x121","what she had heard of the prodigious accumulation of dirt in the course"
"x121","of that hour, she could not from her own observation help thinking that"
"x121","they might have gone with very little inconvenience. To feel herself"
"x121","slighted by them was very painful. On the other hand, the delight of"
"x121","exploring an edifice like Udolpho, as her fancy represented Blaize"
"x121","Castle to be, was such a counterpoise of good as might console her for"
"x121","almost anything."
"x121",""
"x121","They passed briskly down Pulteney Street, and through Laura Place,"
"x121","without the exchange of many words. Thorpe talked to his horse, and she"
"x121","meditated, by turns, on broken promises and broken arches, phaetons"
"x121","and false hangings, Tilneys and trap-doors. As they entered Argyle"
"x121","Buildings, however, she was roused by this address from her companion,"
"x121","""Who is that girl who looked at you so hard as she went by?"""
"x121",""
"x121","""Who? Where?"""
"x121",""
"x121","""On the right-hand pavement--she must be almost out of sight now."""

"x121","walking slowly down the street. She saw them both looking back at her."
"x121","""Stop, stop, Mr. Thorpe,"" she impatiently cried; ""it is Miss Tilney; it"
"x121","is indeed. How could you tell me they were gone? Stop, stop, I will"
"x121","get out this moment and go to them."" But to what purpose did she speak?"
"x121","Thorpe only lashed his horse into a brisker trot; the Tilneys, who had"
"x121","soon ceased to look after her, were in a moment out of sight round the"
"x121","corner of Laura Place, and in another moment she was herself whisked"
"x121","into the marketplace. Still, however, and during the length of another"
"x121","street, she entreated him to stop. ""Pray, pray stop, Mr. Thorpe. I"
"x121","cannot go on. I will not go on. I must go back to Miss Tilney."" But Mr."
"x121","Thorpe only laughed, smacked his whip, encouraged his horse, made odd"
"x121","noises, and drove on; and Catherine, angry and vexed as she was, having"
"x121","no power of getting away, was obliged to give up the point and submit."
"x121","Her reproaches, however, were not spared. ""How could you deceive me so,"
"x121","Mr. Thorpe? How could you say that you saw them driving up the Lansdown"
"x121","Road? I would not have had it happen so for the world. They must think"
"x121","it so strange, so rude of me! To go by them, too, without saying a word!"
"x121","You do not know how vexed I am; I shall have no pleasure at Clifton, nor"
"x121","in anything else. I had rather, ten thousand times rather, get out now,"
"x121","and walk back to them. How could you say you saw them driving out in a"
"x121","phaeton?"" Thorpe defended himself very stoutly, declared he had never"
"x121","seen two men so much alike in his life, and would hardly give up the"
"x121","point of its having been Tilney himself."
"x121",""
"x121","Their drive, even when this subject was over, was not likely to be very"
"x121","agreeable. Catherine's complaisance was no longer what it had been in"
"x121","their former airing. She listened reluctantly, and her replies were"
"x121","short. Blaize Castle remained her only comfort; towards that, she still"
"x121","looked at intervals with pleasure; though rather than be disappointed of"
"x121","the promised walk, and especially rather than be thought ill of by the"
"x121","Tilneys, she would willingly have given up all the happiness which its"
"x121","walls could supply--the happiness of a progress through a long suite of"
"x121","lofty rooms, exhibiting the remains of magnificent furniture, though"
"x121","now for many years deserted--the happiness of being stopped in their way"
"x121","along narrow, winding vaults, by a low, grated door; or even of having"
"x121","their lamp, their only lamp, extinguished by a sudden gust of wind, and"
"x121","of being left in total darkness. In the meanwhile, they proceeded on"
"x121","their journey without any mischance, and were within view of the town"
"x121","of Keynsham, when a halloo from Morland, who was behind them, made his"
"x121","friend pull up, to know what was the matter. The others then came close"
"x121","enough for conversation, and Morland said, ""We had better go back,"
"x121","Thorpe; it is too late to go on today; your sister thinks so as well as"
"x121","I. We have been exactly an hour coming from Pulteney Street, very little"
"x121","more than seven miles; and, I suppose, we have at least eight more to"
"x121","go. It will never do. We set out a great deal too late. We had much"
"x121","better put it off till another day, and turn round."""
"x121",""
"x121","""It is all one to me,"" replied Thorpe rather angrily; and instantly"
"x121","turning his horse, they were on their way back to Bath."
"x121",""
"x121","""If your brother had not got such a d--beast to drive,"" said he soon"
"x121","afterwards, ""we might have done it very well. My horse would have"
"x121","trotted to Clifton within the hour, if left to himself, and I have"
"x121","almost broke my arm with pulling him in to that cursed broken-winded"
"x121","jade's pace. Morland is a fool for not keeping a horse and gig of his"

"x121","""Because he has not money enough."""
"x121",""
"x121","""And whose fault is that?"""
"x121",""
"x121","""Nobody's, that I know of."" Thorpe then said something in the loud,"
"x121","incoherent way to which he had often recourse, about its being a"
"x121","d--thing to be miserly; and that if people who rolled in money could not"
"x121","afford things, he did not know who could, which Catherine did not even"
"x121","endeavour to understand. Disappointed of what was to have been the"
"x121","consolation for her first disappointment, she was less and less disposed"
"x121","either to be agreeable herself or to find her companion so; and they"
"x121","returned to Pulteney Street without her speaking twenty words."
"x121",""
"x121","As she entered the house, the footman told her that a gentleman and lady"
"x121","had called and inquired for her a few minutes after her setting off;"
"x121","that, when he told them she was gone out with Mr. Thorpe, the lady had"
"x121","asked whether any message had been left for her; and on his saying no,"
"x121","had felt for a card, but said she had none about her, and went away."
"x121","Pondering over these heart-rending tidings, Catherine walked slowly"
"x121","upstairs. At the head of them she was met by Mr. Allen, who, on hearing"
"x121","the reason of their speedy return, said, ""I am glad your brother had so"
"x121","much sense; I am glad you are come back. It was a strange, wild scheme."""

"x121","the fate of which she shared, by private partnership with Morland, a"
"x121","very good equivalent for the quiet and country air of an inn at Clifton."
"x121","Her satisfaction, too, in not being at the Lower Rooms was spoken more"
"x121","than once. ""How I pity the poor creatures that are going there! How glad"
"x121","I am that I am not amongst them! I wonder whether it will be a full ball"
"x121","or not! They have not begun dancing yet. I would not be there for"
"x121","all the world. It is so delightful to have an evening now and then"
"x121","to oneself. I dare say it will not be a very good ball. I know the"
"x121","Mitchells will not be there. I am sure I pity everybody that is. But I"
"x121","dare say, Mr. Morland, you long to be at it, do not you? I am sure you"
"x121","do. Well, pray do not let anybody here be a restraint on you. I dare say"
"x121","we could do very well without you; but you men think yourselves of such"

"x121","Catherine could almost have accused Isabella of being wanting in"
"x121","tenderness towards herself and her sorrows, so very little did they"
"x121","appear to dwell on her mind, and so very inadequate was the comfort she"
"x121","offered. ""Do not be so dull, my dearest creature,"" she whispered. ""You"
"x121","will quite break my heart. It was amazingly shocking, to be sure; but"
"x121","the Tilneys were entirely to blame. Why were not they more punctual?"
"x121","It was dirty, indeed, but what did that signify? I am sure John and I"
"x121","should not have minded it. I never mind going through anything, where a"
"x121","friend is concerned; that is my disposition, and John is just the same;"
"x121","he has amazing strong feelings. Good heavens! What a delightful hand you"

"x121","Catherine cheerfully complied, and being properly equipped, was more"
"x121","impatient than ever to be at the pump-room, that she might inform"
"x121","herself of General Tilney's lodgings, for though she believed they were"
"x121","in Milsom Street, she was not certain of the house, and Mrs. Allen's"
"x121","wavering convictions only made it more doubtful. To Milsom Street she"
"x121","was directed, and having made herself perfect in the number, hastened"
"x121","away with eager steps and a beating heart to pay her visit, explain her"
"x121","conduct, and be forgiven; tripping lightly through the church-yard, and"
"x121","resolutely turning away her eyes, that she might not be obliged to"
"x121","see her beloved Isabella and her dear family, who, she had reason to"
"x121","believe, were in a shop hard by. She reached the house without any"
"x121","impediment, looked at the number, knocked at the door, and inquired for"
"x121","Miss Tilney. The man believed Miss Tilney to be at home, but was not"
"x121","quite certain. Would she be pleased to send up her name? She gave her"
"x121","card. In a few minutes the servant returned, and with a look which did"
"x121","not quite confirm his words, said he had been mistaken, for that Miss"
"x121","Tilney was walked out. Catherine, with a blush of mortification, left"
"x121","the house. She felt almost persuaded that Miss Tilney was at home, and"
"x121","too much offended to admit her; and as she retired down the street,"
"x121","could not withhold one glance at the drawing-room windows, in"
"x121","expectation of seeing her there, but no one appeared at them. At the"
"x121","bottom of the street, however, she looked back again, and then, not at a"
"x121","window, but issuing from the door, she saw Miss Tilney herself. She was"
"x121","followed by a gentleman, whom Catherine believed to be her father,"
"x121","and they turned up towards Edgar's Buildings. Catherine, in deep"
"x121","mortification, proceeded on her way. She could almost be angry herself"
"x121","at such angry incivility; but she checked the resentful sensation; she"
"x121","remembered her own ignorance. She knew not how such an offence as hers"
"x121","might be classed by the laws of worldly politeness, to what a degree"
"x121","of unforgivingness it might with propriety lead, nor to what rigours of"
"x121","rudeness in return it might justly make her amenable."
"x121",""
"x121","Dejected and humbled, she had even some thoughts of not going with the"
"x121","others to the theatre that night; but it must be confessed that they"
"x121","were not of long continuance, for she soon recollected, in the first"
"x121","place, that she was without any excuse for staying at home; and, in the"
"x121","second, that it was a play she wanted very much to see. To the theatre"
"x121","accordingly they all went; no Tilneys appeared to plague or please her;"
"x121","she feared that, amongst the many perfections of the family, a fondness"
"x121","for plays was not to be ranked; but perhaps it was because they were"
"x121","habituated to the finer performances of the London stage, which she"
"x121","knew, on Isabella's authority, rendered everything else of the kind"
"x121","""quite horrid."" She was not deceived in her own expectation of pleasure;"
"x121","the comedy so well suspended her care that no one, observing her during"
"x121","the first four acts, would have supposed she had any wretchedness about"
"x121","her. On the beginning of the fifth, however, the sudden view of Mr."
"x121","Henry Tilney and his father, joining a party in the opposite box,"
"x121","recalled her to anxiety and distress. The stage could no longer excite"
"x121","genuine merriment--no longer keep her whole attention. Every other look"
"x121","upon an average was directed towards the opposite box; and, for the"
"x121","space of two entire scenes, did she thus watch Henry Tilney, without"
"x121","being once able to catch his eye. No longer could he be suspected of"
"x121","indifference for a play; his notice was never withdrawn from the stage"
"x121","during two whole scenes. At length, however, he did look towards her,"
"x121","and he bowed--but such a bow! No smile, no continued observance attended"
"x121","it; his eyes were immediately returned to their former direction."
"x121","Catherine was restlessly miserable; she could almost have run round to"
"x121","the box in which he sat and forced him to hear her explanation. Feelings"
"x121","rather natural than heroic possessed her; instead of considering her"
"x121","own dignity injured by this ready condemnation--instead of proudly"
"x121","resolving, in conscious innocence, to show her resentment towards him"
"x121","who could harbour a doubt of it, to leave to him all the trouble"
"x121","of seeking an explanation, and to enlighten him on the past only by"
"x121","avoiding his sight, or flirting with somebody else--she took to herself"
"x121","all the shame of misconduct, or at least of its appearance, and was only"
"x121","eager for an opportunity of explaining its cause."
"x121",""
"x121","The play concluded--the curtain fell--Henry Tilney was no longer to be"
"x121","seen where he had hitherto sat, but his father remained, and perhaps he"
"x121","might be now coming round to their box. She was right; in a few minutes"
"x121","he appeared, and, making his way through the then thinning rows, spoke"
"x121","with like calm politeness to Mrs. Allen and her friend. Not with such"
"x121","calmness was he answered by the latter: ""Oh! Mr. Tilney, I have been"
"x121","quite wild to speak to you, and make my apologies. You must have thought"
"x121","me so rude; but indeed it was not my own fault, was it, Mrs. Allen?"
"x121","Did not they tell me that Mr. Tilney and his sister were gone out in a"

"x121","after our passing you in Argyle Street: you were so kind as to look back"
"x121","on purpose."""

"x121","something more than surprise when she thought she could perceive herself"
"x121","the object of their attention and discourse. What could they have to say"
"x121","of her? She feared General Tilney did not like her appearance: she found"
"x121","it was implied in his preventing her admittance to his daughter, rather"
"x121","than postpone his own walk a few minutes. ""How came Mr. Thorpe to know"

"x121",""
"x121",""
"x121","Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday have now"
"x121","passed in review before the reader; the events of each day, its hopes"
"x121","and fears, mortifications and pleasures, have been separately stated,"
"x121","and the pangs of Sunday only now remain to be described, and close the"
"x121","week. The Clifton scheme had been deferred, not relinquished, and on"
"x121","the afternoon's Crescent of this day, it was brought forward again. In a"
"x121","private consultation between Isabella and James, the former of whom had"
"x121","particularly set her heart upon going, and the latter no less anxiously"
"x121","placed his upon pleasing her, it was agreed that, provided the weather"
"x121","were fair, the party should take place on the following morning; and"
"x121","they were to set off very early, in order to be at home in good time."
"x121","The affair thus determined, and Thorpe's approbation secured, Catherine"
"x121","only remained to be apprised of it. She had left them for a few minutes"
"x121","to speak to Miss Tilney. In that interval the plan was completed, and as"
"x121","soon as she came again, her agreement was demanded; but instead of the"
"x121","gay acquiescence expected by Isabella, Catherine looked grave, was very"
"x121","sorry, but could not go. The engagement which ought to have kept her"
"x121","from joining in the former attempt would make it impossible for her to"
"x121","accompany them now. She had that moment settled with Miss Tilney to take"
"x121","their proposed walk tomorrow; it was quite determined, and she would"
"x121","not, upon any account, retract. But that she must and should retract"
"x121","was instantly the eager cry of both the Thorpes; they must go to Clifton"
"x121","tomorrow, they would not go without her, it would be nothing to put off"
"x121","a mere walk for one day longer, and they would not hear of a refusal."
"x121","Catherine was distressed, but not subdued. ""Do not urge me, Isabella. I"
"x121","am engaged to Miss Tilney. I cannot go."" This availed nothing. The same"
"x121","arguments assailed her again; she must go, she should go, and they would"
"x121","not hear of a refusal. ""It would be so easy to tell Miss Tilney that you"
"x121","had just been reminded of a prior engagement, and must only beg to put"
"x121","off the walk till Tuesday."""
"x121",""
"x121","""No, it would not be easy. I could not do it. There has been no prior"
"x121","engagement."" But Isabella became only more and more urgent, calling"
"x121","on her in the most affectionate manner, addressing her by the most"
"x121","endearing names. She was sure her dearest, sweetest Catherine would not"
"x121","seriously refuse such a trifling request to a friend who loved her so"
"x121","dearly. She knew her beloved Catherine to have so feeling a heart, so"
"x121","sweet a temper, to be so easily persuaded by those she loved. But all"
"x121","in vain; Catherine felt herself to be in the right, and though pained"
"x121","by such tender, such flattering supplication, could not allow it to"
"x121","influence her. Isabella then tried another method. She reproached her"
"x121","with having more affection for Miss Tilney, though she had known her so"
"x121","little a while, than for her best and oldest friends, with being grown"
"x121","cold and indifferent, in short, towards herself. ""I cannot help being"
"x121","jealous, Catherine, when I see myself slighted for strangers, I, who"
"x121","love you so excessively! When once my affections are placed, it is not"
"x121","in the power of anything to change them. But I believe my feelings are"
"x121","stronger than anybody's; I am sure they are too strong for my own peace;"
"x121","and to see myself supplanted in your friendship by strangers does cut me"
"x121","to the quick, I own. These Tilneys seem to swallow up everything else."""
"x121",""
"x121","Catherine thought this reproach equally strange and unkind. Was it the"
"x121","part of a friend thus to expose her feelings to the notice of others?"
"x121","Isabella appeared to her ungenerous and selfish, regardless of"
"x121","everything but her own gratification. These painful ideas crossed her"
"x121","mind, though she said nothing. Isabella, in the meanwhile, had applied"
"x121","her handkerchief to her eyes; and Morland, miserable at such a sight,"
"x121","could not help saying, ""Nay, Catherine. I think you cannot stand out any"
"x121","longer now. The sacrifice is not much; and to oblige such a friend--I"
"x121","shall think you quite unkind, if you still refuse."""
"x121",""
"x121","This was the first time of her brother's openly siding against her, and"
"x121","anxious to avoid his displeasure, she proposed a compromise. If they"
"x121","would only put off their scheme till Tuesday, which they might easily"
"x121","do, as it depended only on themselves, she could go with them, and"
"x121","everybody might then be satisfied. But ""No, no, no!"" was the immediate"
"x121","answer; ""that could not be, for Thorpe did not know that he might not"
"x121","go to town on Tuesday."" Catherine was sorry, but could do no more; and"
"x121","a short silence ensued, which was broken by Isabella, who in a voice of"
"x121","cold resentment said, ""Very well, then there is an end of the party."
"x121","If Catherine does not go, I cannot. I cannot be the only woman. I would"
"x121","not, upon any account in the world, do so improper a thing."""
"x121",""
"x121","""Catherine, you must go,"" said James."
"x121",""
"x121","""But why cannot Mr. Thorpe drive one of his other sisters? I dare say"
"x121","either of them would like to go."""
"x121",""
"x121","""Thank ye,"" cried Thorpe, ""but I did not come to Bath to drive my"

"x121",""
"x121","""That is a compliment which gives me no pleasure."" But her words were"
"x121","lost on Thorpe, who had turned abruptly away."
"x121",""
"x121","The three others still continued together, walking in a most"
"x121","uncomfortable manner to poor Catherine; sometimes not a word was said,"
"x121","sometimes she was again attacked with supplications or reproaches, and"
"x121","her arm was still linked within Isabella's, though their hearts were"
"x121","at war. At one moment she was softened, at another irritated; always"
"x121","distressed, but always steady."
"x121",""
"x121","""I did not think you had been so obstinate, Catherine,"" said James;"
"x121","""you were not used to be so hard to persuade; you once were the kindest,"
"x121","best-tempered of my sisters."""
"x121",""
"x121","""I hope I am not less so now,"" she replied, very feelingly; ""but indeed"

"x121","Catherine's heart swelled; she drew away her arm, and Isabella made no"
"x121","opposition. Thus passed a long ten minutes, till they were again joined"
"x121","by Thorpe, who, coming to them with a gayer look, said, ""Well, I"
"x121","have settled the matter, and now we may all go tomorrow with a safe"

"x121","with us tomorrow, you could not have the pleasure of walking with her"
"x121","till Tuesday. She said very well, Tuesday was just as convenient to her;"
"x121","so there is an end of all our difficulties. A pretty good thought of"

"x121","Isabella, however, caught hold of one hand, Thorpe of the other, and"
"x121","remonstrances poured in from all three. Even James was quite angry. When"
"x121","everything was settled, when Miss Tilney herself said that Tuesday would"
"x121","suit her as well, it was quite ridiculous, quite absurd, to make any"
"x121","further objection."
"x121",""
"x121","""I do not care. Mr. Thorpe had no business to invent any such message."
"x121","If I had thought it right to put it off, I could have spoken to Miss"

"x121","that Mr. Thorpe has--He may be mistaken again perhaps; he led me into"
"x121","one act of rudeness by his mistake on Friday. Let me go, Mr. Thorpe;"
"x121","Isabella, do not hold me."""
"x121",""
"x121","Thorpe told her it would be in vain to go after the Tilneys; they were"
"x121","turning the corner into Brock Street, when he had overtaken them, and"
"x121","were at home by this time."
"x121",""
"x121","""Then I will go after them,"" said Catherine; ""wherever they are I will"
"x121","go after them. It does not signify talking. If I could not be persuaded"
"x121","into doing what I thought wrong, I never will be tricked into it."""
"x121","And with these words she broke away and hurried off. Thorpe would have"
"x121","darted after her, but Morland withheld him. ""Let her go, let her go, if"
"x121","she will go."""
"x121",""
"x121","""She is as obstinate as--"""

"x121","Thorpe never finished the simile, for it could hardly have been a proper"
"x121","one."

"x121","Away walked Catherine in great agitation, as fast as the crowd would"
"x121","permit her, fearful of being pursued, yet determined to persevere. As"
"x121","she walked, she reflected on what had passed. It was painful to her to"
"x121","disappoint and displease them, particularly to displease her brother;"
"x121","but she could not repent her resistance. Setting her own inclination"
"x121","apart, to have failed a second time in her engagement to Miss Tilney, to"
"x121","have retracted a promise voluntarily made only five minutes before,"
"x121","and on a false pretence too, must have been wrong. She had not been"
"x121","withstanding them on selfish principles alone, she had not consulted"
"x121","merely her own gratification; that might have been ensured in some"
"x121","degree by the excursion itself, by seeing Blaize Castle; no, she had"
"x121","attended to what was due to others, and to her own character in their"
"x121","opinion. Her conviction of being right, however, was not enough to"
"x121","restore her composure; till she had spoken to Miss Tilney she could not"
"x121","be at ease; and quickening her pace when she got clear of the Crescent,"
"x121","she almost ran over the remaining ground till she gained the top of"
"x121","Milsom Street. So rapid had been her movements that in spite of the"
"x121","Tilneys' advantage in the outset, they were but just turning into"
"x121","their lodgings as she came within view of them; and the servant still"
"x121","remaining at the open door, she used only the ceremony of saying"
"x121","that she must speak with Miss Tilney that moment, and hurrying by him"
"x121","proceeded upstairs. Then, opening the first door before her, which"
"x121","happened to be the right, she immediately found herself in the"
"x121","drawing-room with General Tilney, his son, and daughter. Her"
"x121","explanation, defective only in being--from her irritation of nerves and"
"x121","shortness of breath--no explanation at all, was instantly given. ""I am"
"x121","come in a great hurry--It was all a mistake--I never promised to go--I"
"x121","told them from the first I could not go.--I ran away in a great hurry"
"x121","to explain it.--I did not care what you thought of me.--I would not stay"
"x121","for the servant."""
"x121",""
"x121","The business, however, though not perfectly elucidated by this speech,"
"x121","soon ceased to be a puzzle. Catherine found that John Thorpe had given"
"x121","the message; and Miss Tilney had no scruple in owning herself greatly"
"x121","surprised by it. But whether her brother had still exceeded her in"
"x121","resentment, Catherine, though she instinctively addressed herself as"
"x121","much to one as to the other in her vindication, had no means of knowing."
"x121","Whatever might have been felt before her arrival, her eager declarations"
"x121","immediately made every look and sentence as friendly as she could"
"x121","desire."
"x121",""
"x121","The affair thus happily settled, she was introduced by Miss Tilney"
"x121","to her father, and received by him with such ready, such solicitous"
"x121","politeness as recalled Thorpe's information to her mind, and made her"
"x121","think with pleasure that he might be sometimes depended on. To such"
"x121","anxious attention was the general's civility carried, that not aware of"
"x121","her extraordinary swiftness in entering the house, he was quite angry"
"x121","with the servant whose neglect had reduced her to open the door of the"
"x121","apartment herself. ""What did William mean by it? He should make a point"
"x121","of inquiring into the matter."" And if Catherine had not most warmly"
"x121","asserted his innocence, it seemed likely that William would lose the"
"x121","favour of his master forever, if not his place, by her rapidity."
"x121",""
"x121","After sitting with them a quarter of an hour, she rose to take leave,"
"x121","and was then most agreeably surprised by General Tilney's asking her if"
"x121","she would do his daughter the honour of dining and spending the rest"
"x121","of the day with her. Miss Tilney added her own wishes. Catherine was"
"x121","greatly obliged; but it was quite out of her power. Mr. and Mrs. Allen"
"x121","would expect her back every moment. The general declared he could say no"
"x121","more; the claims of Mr. and Mrs. Allen were not to be superseded; but on"
"x121","some other day he trusted, when longer notice could be given, they would"
"x121","not refuse to spare her to her friend. ""Oh, no; Catherine was sure they"
"x121","would not have the least objection, and she should have great pleasure"
"x121","in coming."" The general attended her himself to the street-door, saying"
"x121","everything gallant as they went downstairs, admiring the elasticity of"
"x121","her walk, which corresponded exactly with the spirit of her dancing, and"
"x121","making her one of the most graceful bows she had ever beheld, when they"
"x121","parted."
"x121",""
"x121","Catherine, delighted by all that had passed, proceeded gaily to Pulteney"
"x121","Street, walking, as she concluded, with great elasticity, though she"
"x121","had never thought of it before. She reached home without seeing anything"
"x121","more of the offended party; and now that she had been triumphant"
"x121","throughout, had carried her point, and was secure of her walk, she began"
"x121","(as the flutter of her spirits subsided) to doubt whether she had been"
"x121","perfectly right. A sacrifice was always noble; and if she had given way"
"x121","to their entreaties, she should have been spared the distressing idea of"
"x121","a friend displeased, a brother angry, and a scheme of great happiness"
"x121","to both destroyed, perhaps through her means. To ease her mind, and"
"x121","ascertain by the opinion of an unprejudiced person what her own conduct"
"x121","had really been, she took occasion to mention before Mr. Allen the"
"x121","half-settled scheme of her brother and the Thorpes for the following"
"x121","day. Mr. Allen caught at it directly. ""Well,"" said he, ""and do you think"
"x121","of going too?"""

"x121","Delighting, however, as Catherine sincerely did in the prospect of the"

"x121",""
"x121","""For my own part,"" said Isabella, ""my wishes are so moderate that the"

"x121","the party, she found, on her return, without spending many hours in"
"x121","the examination of her feelings, that she had gone to her appointment"
"x121","preparing for happiness which it had not afforded. Instead of finding"
"x121","herself improved in acquaintance with Miss Tilney, from the intercourse"
"x121","of the day, she seemed hardly so intimate with her as before; instead"
"x121","of seeing Henry Tilney to greater advantage than ever, in the ease of a"
"x121","family party, he had never said so little, nor been so little agreeable;"
"x121","and, in spite of their father's great civilities to her--in spite of his"
"x121","thanks, invitations, and compliments--it had been a release to get"
"x121","away from him. It puzzled her to account for all this. It could not"
"x121","be General Tilney's fault. That he was perfectly agreeable and"
"x121","good-natured, and altogether a very charming man, did not admit of a"
"x121","doubt, for he was tall and handsome, and Henry's father. He could not"
"x121","be accountable for his children's want of spirits, or for her want of"
"x121","enjoyment in his company. The former she hoped at last might have"

"x121","stupidity. Isabella, on hearing the particulars of the visit, gave"
"x121","a different explanation: ""It was all pride, pride, insufferable"

"x121","within her hearing, he not only protested against every thought of"
"x121","dancing himself, but even laughed openly at Henry for finding it"
"x121","possible. From the latter circumstance it may be presumed that, whatever"
"x121","might be our heroine's opinion of him, his admiration of her was not"

"x121","they, by whom, above all, she desired to be favourably thought of,"
"x121","outstripped even her wishes in the flattering measures by which their"

"x121","was to be for weeks under the same roof with the person whose society"

"x121","usually the charm of those reveries which his image did not fill. To see"
"x121","and explore either the ramparts and keep of the one, or the cloisters"
"x121","of the other, had been for many weeks a darling wish, though to be more"
"x121","than the visitor of an hour had seemed too nearly impossible for desire."
"x121","And yet, this was to happen. With all the chances against her of house,"

"x121","and she was to be its inhabitant. Its long, damp passages, its narrow"
"x121","cells and ruined chapel, were to be within her daily reach, and she"

"x121","could distinguish, ""What! Always to be watched, in person or by proxy!"""
"x121",""
"x121","""Psha, nonsense!"" was Isabella's answer in the same half whisper. ""Why"

"x121","returning home, she joined her and walked out of the pump-room, leaving"
"x121","Isabella still sitting with Captain Tilney. With much uneasiness did"
"x121","she thus leave them. It seemed to her that Captain Tilney was falling"
"x121","in love with Isabella, and Isabella unconsciously encouraging him;"
"x121","unconsciously it must be, for Isabella's attachment to James was as"
"x121","certain and well acknowledged as her engagement. To doubt her truth"
"x121","or good intentions was impossible; and yet, during the whole of their"
"x121","conversation her manner had been odd. She wished Isabella had talked"
"x121","more like her usual self, and not so much about money, and had not"
"x121","looked so well pleased at the sight of Captain Tilney. How strange that"
"x121","she should not perceive his admiration! Catherine longed to give her a"
"x121","hint of it, to put her on her guard, and prevent all the pain which"
"x121","her too lively behaviour might otherwise create both for him and her"
"x121","brother."

"x121","The compliment of John Thorpe's affection did not make amends for this"
"x121","thoughtlessness in his sister. She was almost as far from believing as"
"x121","from wishing it to be sincere; for she had not forgotten that he"
"x121","could mistake, and his assertion of the offer and of her encouragement"
"x121","convinced her that his mistakes could sometimes be very egregious."
"x121","In vanity, therefore, she gained but little; her chief profit was in"

"x121",""
"x121",""
"x121","A few days passed away, and Catherine, though not allowing herself to"
"x121","suspect her friend, could not help watching her closely. The result of"
"x121","her observations was not agreeable. Isabella seemed an altered creature."
"x121","When she saw her, indeed, surrounded only by their immediate friends"
"x121","in Edgar's Buildings or Pulteney Street, her change of manners was so"
"x121","trifling that, had it gone no farther, it might have passed unnoticed."
"x121","A something of languid indifference, or of that boasted absence of"
"x121","mind which Catherine had never heard of before, would occasionally come"
"x121","across her; but had nothing worse appeared, that might only have spread"
"x121","a new grace and inspired a warmer interest. But when Catherine saw her"
"x121","in public, admitting Captain Tilney's attentions as readily as they were"
"x121","offered, and allowing him almost an equal share with James in her notice"
"x121","and smiles, the alteration became too positive to be passed over. What"
"x121","could be meant by such unsteady conduct, what her friend could be at,"
"x121","was beyond her comprehension. Isabella could not be aware of the pain"
"x121","she was inflicting; but it was a degree of wilful thoughtlessness which"
"x121","Catherine could not but resent. James was the sufferer. She saw him"
"x121","grave and uneasy; and however careless of his present comfort the woman"
"x121","might be who had given him her heart, to her it was always an object."
"x121","For poor Captain Tilney too she was greatly concerned. Though his looks"
"x121","did not please her, his name was a passport to her goodwill, and she"
"x121","thought with sincere compassion of his approaching disappointment; for,"
"x121","in spite of what she had believed herself to overhear in the pump-room,"
"x121","his behaviour was so incompatible with a knowledge of Isabella's"
"x121","engagement that she could not, upon reflection, imagine him aware of it."
"x121","He might be jealous of her brother as a rival, but if more had seemed"
"x121","implied, the fault must have been in her misapprehension. She wished, by"
"x121","a gentle remonstrance, to remind Isabella of her situation, and make"
"x121","her aware of this double unkindness; but for remonstrance, either"
"x121","opportunity or comprehension was always against her. If able to suggest"
"x121","a hint, Isabella could never understand it. In this distress, the"
"x121","intended departure of the Tilney family became her chief consolation;"
"x121","their journey into Gloucestershire was to take place within a few days,"
"x121","and Captain Tilney's removal would at least restore peace to every heart"
"x121","but his own. But Captain Tilney had at present no intention of removing;"
"x121","he was not to be of the party to Northanger; he was to continue at Bath."
"x121","When Catherine knew this, her resolution was directly made. She spoke to"
"x121","Henry Tilney on the subject, regretting his brother's evident partiality"
"x121","for Miss Thorpe, and entreating him to make known her prior engagement."

"x121","he stays, the worse it will be for him at last. Pray advise him for his"
"x121","own sake, and for everybody's sake, to leave Bath directly. Absence will"

"x121",""
"x121","""No, he does not know what he is about,"" cried Catherine; ""he does not"

"x121","Catherine blushed for her friend, and said, ""Isabella is wrong. But I"

"x121","man; he has had about a week's acquaintance with your friend, and he has"
"x121","known her engagement almost as long as he has known her."""
"x121",""
"x121","""Well,"" said Catherine, after some moments' consideration, ""you may be"
"x121","able to guess at your brother's intentions from all this; but I am sure"
"x121","I cannot. But is not your father uncomfortable about it? Does not he"

"x121","Miss Thorpe's, for supposing that her affection, or at least her good"
"x121","behaviour, is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of Captain"
"x121","Tilney? Is he safe only in solitude? Or is her heart constant to him"

"x121","be uneasy,' because I know that you are so, at this moment; but be as"

"x121","in, that she had some difficulty in saving her own new writing-desk from"

"x121","the handsome, highly fed four horses of a gentleman usually perform a"

"x121","given; and much was Catherine then surprised by the general's proposal"
"x121","of her taking his place in his son's curricle for the rest of the"
"x121","journey: ""the day was fine, and he was anxious for her seeing as much of"
"x121","the country as possible."""
"x121",""
"x121","The remembrance of Mr. Allen's opinion, respecting young men's open"
"x121","carriages, made her blush at the mention of such a plan, and her first"
"x121","thought was to decline it; but her second was of greater deference for"
"x121","General Tilney's judgment; he could not propose anything improper for"
"x121","her; and, in the course of a few minutes, she found herself with Henry"
"x121","in the curricle, as happy a being as ever existed. A very short trial"
"x121","convinced her that a curricle was the prettiest equipage in the world;"
"x121","the chaise and four wheeled off with some grandeur, to be sure, but it"
"x121","was a heavy and troublesome business, and she could not easily forget"
"x121","its having stopped two hours at Petty France. Half the time would"
"x121","have been enough for the curricle, and so nimbly were the light horses"
"x121","disposed to move, that, had not the general chosen to have his own"
"x121","carriage lead the way, they could have passed it with ease in half a"
"x121","minute. But the merit of the curricle did not all belong to the horses;"
"x121","Henry drove so well--so quietly--without making any disturbance,"
"x121","without parading to her, or swearing at them: so different from the only"
"x121","gentleman-coachman whom it was in her power to compare him with! And"
"x121","then his hat sat so well, and the innumerable capes of his greatcoat"
"x121","looked so becomingly important! To be driven by him, next to being"
"x121","dancing with him, was certainly the greatest happiness in the world. In"
"x121","addition to every other delight, she had now that of listening to her"
"x121","own praise; of being thanked at least, on his sister's account, for"
"x121","her kindness in thus becoming her visitor; of hearing it ranked as real"
"x121","friendship, and described as creating real gratitude. His sister, he"
"x121","said, was uncomfortably circumstanced--she had no female companion--and,"
"x121","in the frequent absence of her father, was sometimes without any"
"x121","companion at all."
"x121",""
"x121","""But how can that be?"" said Catherine. ""Are not you with her?"""
"x121",""
"x121","""Northanger is not more than half my home; I have an establishment at"

"x121","and some of my time is necessarily spent there."""
"x121",""
"x121","""How sorry you must be for that!"""

"x121","""I am always sorry to leave Eleanor."""

"x121","""Yes; but besides your affection for her, you must be so fond of"

"x121",""
"x121","""Oh! yes--I do not think I should be easily frightened, because there"
"x121","would be so many people in the house--and besides, it has never been"
"x121","uninhabited and left deserted for years, and then the family come back"
"x121","to it unawares, without giving any notice, as generally happens."""
"x121",""
"x121","""No, certainly. We shall not have to explore our way into a hall dimly"
"x121","lighted by the expiring embers of a wood fire--nor be obliged to spread"
"x121","our beds on the floor of a room without windows, doors, or furniture."
"x121","But you must be aware that when a young lady is (by whatever means)"
"x121","introduced into a dwelling of this kind, she is always lodged apart from"
"x121","the rest of the family. While they snugly repair to their own end of the"

"x121","a different staircase, and along many gloomy passages, into an apartment"
"x121","never used since some cousin or kin died in it about twenty years"
"x121","before. Can you stand such a ceremony as this? Will not your mind"
"x121","misgive you when you find yourself in this gloomy chamber--too lofty and"
"x121","extensive for you, with only the feeble rays of a single lamp to take"
"x121","in its size--its walls hung with tapestry exhibiting figures as large as"
"x121","life, and the bed, of dark green stuff or purple velvet, presenting even"
"x121","a funereal appearance? Will not your heart sink within you?"""
"x121",""

"x121","ponderous chest which no efforts can open, and over the fireplace"
"x121","the portrait of some handsome warrior, whose features will so"
"x121","incomprehensibly strike you, that you will not be able to withdraw your"

"x121","gazes on you in great agitation, and drops a few unintelligible hints."
"x121","To raise your spirits, moreover, she gives you reason to suppose that"
"x121","the part of the abbey you inhabit is undoubtedly haunted, and informs"
"x121","you that you will not have a single domestic within call. With this"

"x121","receding footsteps as long as the last echo can reach you--and when,"
"x121","with fainting spirits, you attempt to fasten your door, you discover,"
"x121","with increased alarm, that it has no lock."""
"x121",""
"x121","""Oh! Mr. Tilney, how frightful! This is just like a book! But it cannot"

"x121",""
"x121","""Nothing further to alarm perhaps may occur the first night. After"

"x121","farthest the third night after your arrival, you will probably have a"
"x121","violent storm. Peals of thunder so loud as to seem to shake the edifice"

"x121","arise, and throwing your dressing-gown around you, proceed to examine"
"x121","this mystery. After a very short search, you will discover a division in"
"x121","the tapestry so artfully constructed as to defy the minutest inspection,"
"x121","and on opening it, a door will immediately appear--which door, being"
"x121","only secured by massy bars and a padlock, you will, after a few efforts,"
"x121","succeed in opening--and, with your lamp in your hand, will pass through"

"x121","""What! Not when Dorothy has given you to understand that there is a"
"x121","secret subterraneous communication between your apartment and the chapel"
"x121","of St. Anthony, scarcely two miles off? Could you shrink from so simple"
"x121","an adventure? No, no, you will proceed into this small vaulted room,"
"x121","and through this into several others, without perceiving anything very"
"x121","remarkable in either. In one perhaps there may be a dagger, in another"
"x121","a few drops of blood, and in a third the remains of some instrument of"
"x121","torture; but there being nothing in all this out of the common way,"
"x121","and your lamp being nearly exhausted, you will return towards your own"
"x121","apartment. In repassing through the small vaulted room, however, your"
"x121","eyes will be attracted towards a large, old-fashioned cabinet of ebony"
"x121","and gold, which, though narrowly examining the furniture before, you"
"x121","had passed unnoticed. Impelled by an irresistible presentiment, you will"
"x121","eagerly advance to it, unlock its folding doors, and search into"
"x121","every drawer--but for some time without discovering anything of"
"x121","importance--perhaps nothing but a considerable hoard of diamonds. At"
"x121","last, however, by touching a secret spring, an inner compartment will"
"x121","open--a roll of paper appears--you seize it--it contains many sheets of"
"x121","manuscript--you hasten with the precious treasure into your own chamber,"
"x121","but scarcely have you been able to decipher 'Oh! Thou--whomsoever thou"
"x121","mayst be, into whose hands these memoirs of the wretched Matilda may"

"x121","But Henry was too much amused by the interest he had raised to be able"
"x121","to carry it farther; he could no longer command solemnity either of"
"x121","subject or voice, and was obliged to entreat her to use her own fancy"
"x121","in the perusal of Matilda's woes. Catherine, recollecting herself, grew"
"x121","ashamed of her eagerness, and began earnestly to assure him that her"
"x121","attention had been fixed without the smallest apprehension of really"
"x121","meeting with what he related. ""Miss Tilney, she was sure, would never"

"x121",""
"x121","As they drew near the end of their journey, her impatience for a sight"
"x121","of the abbey--for some time suspended by his conversation on subjects"
"x121","very different--returned in full force, and every bend in the road was"
"x121","expected with solemn awe to afford a glimpse of its massy walls of grey"
"x121","stone, rising amidst a grove of ancient oaks, with the last beams of the"
"x121","sun playing in beautiful splendour on its high Gothic windows. But so"
"x121","low did the building stand, that she found herself passing through the"
"x121","great gates of the lodge into the very grounds of Northanger, without"
"x121","having discerned even an antique chimney."
"x121",""
"x121","She knew not that she had any right to be surprised, but there was a"
"x121","something in this mode of approach which she certainly had not expected."
"x121","To pass between lodges of a modern appearance, to find herself with such"
"x121","ease in the very precincts of the abbey, and driven so rapidly along a"
"x121","smooth, level road of fine gravel, without obstacle, alarm, or solemnity"
"x121","of any kind, struck her as odd and inconsistent. She was not long"
"x121","at leisure, however, for such considerations. A sudden scud of rain,"
"x121","driving full in her face, made it impossible for her to observe anything"
"x121","further, and fixed all her thoughts on the welfare of her new straw"
"x121","bonnet; and she was actually under the abbey walls, was springing, with"
"x121","Henry's assistance, from the carriage, was beneath the shelter of the"
"x121","old porch, and had even passed on to the hall, where her friend and"
"x121","the general were waiting to welcome her, without feeling one awful"
"x121","foreboding of future misery to herself, or one moment's suspicion of any"
"x121","past scenes of horror being acted within the solemn edifice. The breeze"
"x121","had not seemed to waft the sighs of the murdered to her; it had wafted"
"x121","nothing worse than a thick mizzling rain; and having given a good shake"
"x121","to her habit, she was ready to be shown into the common drawing-room,"
"x121","and capable of considering where she was."
"x121",""
"x121","An abbey! Yes, it was delightful to be really in an abbey! But she"
"x121","doubted, as she looked round the room, whether anything within her"
"x121","observation would have given her the consciousness. The furniture was in"
"x121","all the profusion and elegance of modern taste. The fireplace, where she"
"x121","had expected the ample width and ponderous carving of former times, was"
"x121","contracted to a Rumford, with slabs of plain though handsome marble, and"
"x121","ornaments over it of the prettiest English china. The windows, to which"
"x121","she looked with peculiar dependence, from having heard the general talk"
"x121","of his preserving them in their Gothic form with reverential care, were"
"x121","yet less what her fancy had portrayed. To be sure, the pointed arch"
"x121","was preserved--the form of them was Gothic--they might be even"
"x121","casements--but every pane was so large, so clear, so light! To an"
"x121","imagination which had hoped for the smallest divisions, and the heaviest"
"x121","stone-work, for painted glass, dirt, and cobwebs, the difference was"
"x121","very distressing."
"x121",""
"x121","The general, perceiving how her eye was employed, began to talk of the"
"x121","smallness of the room and simplicity of the furniture, where everything,"
"x121","being for daily use, pretended only to comfort, etc.; flattering"
"x121","himself, however, that there were some apartments in the Abbey not"
"x121","unworthy her notice--and was proceeding to mention the costly gilding"
"x121","of one in particular, when, taking out his watch, he stopped short to"
"x121","pronounce it with surprise within twenty minutes of five! This seemed"
"x121","the word of separation, and Catherine found herself hurried away by Miss"
"x121","Tilney in such a manner as convinced her that the strictest punctuality"
"x121","to the family hours would be expected at Northanger."
"x121",""
"x121","Returning through the large and lofty hall, they ascended a broad"
"x121","staircase of shining oak, which, after many flights and many"
"x121","landing-places, brought them upon a long, wide gallery. On one side it"
"x121","had a range of doors, and it was lighted on the other by windows which"
"x121","Catherine had only time to discover looked into a quadrangle, before"
"x121","Miss Tilney led the way into a chamber, and scarcely staying to hope she"
"x121","would find it comfortable, left her with an anxious entreaty that she"
"x121","would make as little alteration as possible in her dress."

"x121","CHAPTER 21"
"x121",""
"x121",""
"x121","A moment's glance was enough to satisfy Catherine that her apartment"
"x121","was very unlike the one which Henry had endeavoured to alarm her by the"
"x121","description of. It was by no means unreasonably large, and contained"
"x121","neither tapestry nor velvet. The walls were papered, the floor was"
"x121","carpeted; the windows were neither less perfect nor more dim than those"
"x121","of the drawing-room below; the furniture, though not of the latest"
"x121","fashion, was handsome and comfortable, and the air of the room"
"x121","altogether far from uncheerful. Her heart instantaneously at ease on"
"x121","this point, she resolved to lose no time in particular examination of"
"x121","anything, as she greatly dreaded disobliging the general by any delay."
"x121","Her habit therefore was thrown off with all possible haste, and she was"
"x121","preparing to unpin the linen package, which the chaise-seat had conveyed"
"x121","for her immediate accommodation, when her eye suddenly fell on a large"
"x121","high chest, standing back in a deep recess on one side of the fireplace."
"x121","The sight of it made her start; and, forgetting everything else, she"
"x121","stood gazing on it in motionless wonder, while these thoughts crossed"
"x121","her:"
"x121",""
"x121","""This is strange indeed! I did not expect such a sight as this! An"
"x121","immense heavy chest! What can it hold? Why should it be placed here?"
"x121","Pushed back too, as if meant to be out of sight! I will look into"
"x121","it--cost me what it may, I will look into it--and directly too--by"
"x121","daylight. If I stay till evening my candle may go out."" She advanced and"
"x121","examined it closely: it was of cedar, curiously inlaid with some darker"
"x121","wood, and raised, about a foot from the ground, on a carved stand of the"
"x121","same. The lock was silver, though tarnished from age; at each end"
"x121","were the imperfect remains of handles also of silver, broken perhaps"
"x121","prematurely by some strange violence; and, on the centre of the lid, was"
"x121","a mysterious cipher, in the same metal. Catherine bent over it intently,"
"x121","but without being able to distinguish anything with certainty. She could"
"x121","not, in whatever direction she took it, believe the last letter to be"
"x121","a T; and yet that it should be anything else in that house was"
"x121","a circumstance to raise no common degree of astonishment. If not"
"x121","originally theirs, by what strange events could it have fallen into the"
"x121","Tilney family?"
"x121",""
"x121","Her fearful curiosity was every moment growing greater; and seizing,"
"x121","with trembling hands, the hasp of the lock, she resolved at all hazards"
"x121","to satisfy herself at least as to its contents. With difficulty, for"
"x121","something seemed to resist her efforts, she raised the lid a few inches;"
"x121","but at that moment a sudden knocking at the door of the room made her,"
"x121","starting, quit her hold, and the lid closed with alarming violence. This"
"x121","ill-timed intruder was Miss Tilney's maid, sent by her mistress to be of"
"x121","use to Miss Morland; and though Catherine immediately dismissed her, it"
"x121","recalled her to the sense of what she ought to be doing, and forced her,"
"x121","in spite of her anxious desire to penetrate this mystery, to proceed in"
"x121","her dressing without further delay. Her progress was not quick, for her"
"x121","thoughts and her eyes were still bent on the object so well calculated"
"x121","to interest and alarm; and though she dared not waste a moment upon"
"x121","a second attempt, she could not remain many paces from the chest. At"
"x121","length, however, having slipped one arm into her gown, her toilette"
"x121","seemed so nearly finished that the impatience of her curiosity might"
"x121","safely be indulged. One moment surely might be spared; and, so desperate"
"x121","should be the exertion of her strength, that, unless secured by"
"x121","supernatural means, the lid in one moment should be thrown back. With"
"x121","this spirit she sprang forward, and her confidence did not deceive her."
"x121","Her resolute effort threw back the lid, and gave to her astonished eyes"
"x121","the view of a white cotton counterpane, properly folded, reposing at one"
"x121","end of the chest in undisputed possession!"
"x121",""
"x121","She was gazing on it with the first blush of surprise when Miss Tilney,"
"x121","anxious for her friend's being ready, entered the room, and to the"
"x121","rising shame of having harboured for some minutes an absurd expectation,"
"x121","was then added the shame of being caught in so idle a search. ""That is"
"x121","a curious old chest, is not it?"" said Miss Tilney, as Catherine hastily"
"x121","closed it and turned away to the glass. ""It is impossible to say how"
"x121","many generations it has been here. How it came to be first put in this"
"x121","room I know not, but I have not had it moved, because I thought it might"
"x121","sometimes be of use in holding hats and bonnets. The worst of it is that"
"x121","its weight makes it difficult to open. In that corner, however, it is at"
"x121","least out of the way."""
"x121",""
"x121","Catherine had no leisure for speech, being at once blushing, tying her"
"x121","gown, and forming wise resolutions with the most violent dispatch. Miss"
"x121","Tilney gently hinted her fear of being late; and in half a minute they"
"x121","ran downstairs together, in an alarm not wholly unfounded, for General"
"x121","Tilney was pacing the drawing-room, his watch in his hand, and having,"
"x121","on the very instant of their entering, pulled the bell with violence,"
"x121","ordered ""Dinner to be on table directly!"""
"x121",""
"x121","Catherine trembled at the emphasis with which he spoke, and sat pale"
"x121","and breathless, in a most humble mood, concerned for his children, and"
"x121","detesting old chests; and the general, recovering his politeness as he"
"x121","looked at her, spent the rest of his time in scolding his daughter for"
"x121","so foolishly hurrying her fair friend, who was absolutely out of breath"
"x121","from haste, when there was not the least occasion for hurry in the"
"x121","world: but Catherine could not at all get over the double distress"
"x121","of having involved her friend in a lecture and been a great simpleton"
"x121","herself, till they were happily seated at the dinner-table, when the"
"x121","general's complacent smiles, and a good appetite of her own, restored"
"x121","her to peace. The dining-parlour was a noble room, suitable in its"
"x121","dimensions to a much larger drawing-room than the one in common use, and"
"x121","fitted up in a style of luxury and expense which was almost lost on the"
"x121","unpractised eye of Catherine, who saw little more than its spaciousness"
"x121","and the number of their attendants. Of the former, she spoke aloud"
"x121","her admiration; and the general, with a very gracious countenance,"
"x121","acknowledged that it was by no means an ill-sized room, and further"
"x121","confessed that, though as careless on such subjects as most people, he"
"x121","did look upon a tolerably large eating-room as one of the necessaries"
"x121","of life; he supposed, however, ""that she must have been used to much"
"x121","better-sized apartments at Mr. Allen's?"""
"x121",""
"x121","""No, indeed,"" was Catherine's honest assurance; ""Mr. Allen's"
"x121","dining-parlour was not more than half as large,"" and she had never"
"x121","seen so large a room as this in her life. The general's good humour"
"x121","increased. Why, as he had such rooms, he thought it would be simple not"
"x121","to make use of them; but, upon his honour, he believed there might be"
"x121","more comfort in rooms of only half their size. Mr. Allen's house, he was"
"x121","sure, must be exactly of the true size for rational happiness."
"x121",""
"x121","The evening passed without any further disturbance, and, in the"
"x121","occasional absence of General Tilney, with much positive cheerfulness."
"x121","It was only in his presence that Catherine felt the smallest fatigue"
"x121","from her journey; and even then, even in moments of languor or"
"x121","restraint, a sense of general happiness preponderated, and she could"
"x121","think of her friends in Bath without one wish of being with them."
"x121",""
"x121","The night was stormy; the wind had been rising at intervals the whole"
"x121","afternoon; and by the time the party broke up, it blew and rained"
"x121","violently. Catherine, as she crossed the hall, listened to the tempest"
"x121","with sensations of awe; and, when she heard it rage round a corner of"
"x121","the ancient building and close with sudden fury a distant door, felt"
"x121","for the first time that she was really in an abbey. Yes, these were"
"x121","characteristic sounds; they brought to her recollection a countless"
"x121","variety of dreadful situations and horrid scenes, which such buildings"
"x121","had witnessed, and such storms ushered in; and most heartily did she"
"x121","rejoice in the happier circumstances attending her entrance within walls"
"x121","so solemn! She had nothing to dread from midnight assassins or drunken"
"x121","gallants. Henry had certainly been only in jest in what he had told her"
"x121","that morning. In a house so furnished, and so guarded, she could have"
"x121","nothing to explore or to suffer, and might go to her bedroom as securely"
"x121","as if it had been her own chamber at Fullerton. Thus wisely fortifying"
"x121","her mind, as she proceeded upstairs, she was enabled, especially on"
"x121","perceiving that Miss Tilney slept only two doors from her, to enter"
"x121","her room with a tolerably stout heart; and her spirits were immediately"
"x121","assisted by the cheerful blaze of a wood fire. ""How much better is"
"x121","this,"" said she, as she walked to the fender--""how much better to find a"
"x121","fire ready lit, than to have to wait shivering in the cold till all the"
"x121","family are in bed, as so many poor girls have been obliged to do, and"
"x121","then to have a faithful old servant frightening one by coming in with a"
"x121","faggot! How glad I am that Northanger is what it is! If it had been like"
"x121","some other places, I do not know that, in such a night as this, I could"
"x121","have answered for my courage: but now, to be sure, there is nothing to"
"x121","alarm one."""
"x121",""
"x121","She looked round the room. The window curtains seemed in motion. It"
"x121","could be nothing but the violence of the wind penetrating through the"
"x121","divisions of the shutters; and she stepped boldly forward, carelessly"
"x121","humming a tune, to assure herself of its being so, peeped courageously"
"x121","behind each curtain, saw nothing on either low window seat to scare her,"
"x121","and on placing a hand against the shutter, felt the strongest conviction"
"x121","of the wind's force. A glance at the old chest, as she turned away from"
"x121","this examination, was not without its use; she scorned the causeless"
"x121","fears of an idle fancy, and began with a most happy indifference to"
"x121","prepare herself for bed. ""She should take her time; she should not hurry"
"x121","herself; she did not care if she were the last person up in the house."
"x121","But she would not make up her fire; that would seem cowardly, as if"
"x121","she wished for the protection of light after she were in bed."" The fire"
"x121","therefore died away, and Catherine, having spent the best part of an"
"x121","hour in her arrangements, was beginning to think of stepping into bed,"
"x121","when, on giving a parting glance round the room, she was struck by the"
"x121","appearance of a high, old-fashioned black cabinet, which, though in"
"x121","a situation conspicuous enough, had never caught her notice before."
"x121","Henry's words, his description of the ebony cabinet which was to escape"
"x121","her observation at first, immediately rushed across her; and though"
"x121","there could be nothing really in it, there was something whimsical, it"
"x121","was certainly a very remarkable coincidence! She took her candle and"
"x121","looked closely at the cabinet. It was not absolutely ebony and gold; but"
"x121","it was japan, black and yellow japan of the handsomest kind; and as she"
"x121","held her candle, the yellow had very much the effect of gold. The key"
"x121","was in the door, and she had a strange fancy to look into it; not,"
"x121","however, with the smallest expectation of finding anything, but it was"
"x121","so very odd, after what Henry had said. In short, she could not sleep"
"x121","till she had examined it. So, placing the candle with great caution on"
"x121","a chair, she seized the key with a very tremulous hand and tried to turn"
"x121","it; but it resisted her utmost strength. Alarmed, but not discouraged,"
"x121","she tried it another way; a bolt flew, and she believed herself"
"x121","successful; but how strangely mysterious! The door was still immovable."
"x121","She paused a moment in breathless wonder. The wind roared down the"
"x121","chimney, the rain beat in torrents against the windows, and everything"
"x121","seemed to speak the awfulness of her situation. To retire to bed,"
"x121","however, unsatisfied on such a point, would be vain, since sleep must be"
"x121","impossible with the consciousness of a cabinet so mysteriously closed"
"x121","in her immediate vicinity. Again, therefore, she applied herself to the"
"x121","key, and after moving it in every possible way for some instants with"
"x121","the determined celerity of hope's last effort, the door suddenly yielded"
"x121","to her hand: her heart leaped with exultation at such a victory, and"
"x121","having thrown open each folding door, the second being secured only by"
"x121","bolts of less wonderful construction than the lock, though in that her"
"x121","eye could not discern anything unusual, a double range of small drawers"
"x121","appeared in view, with some larger drawers above and below them; and in"
"x121","the centre, a small door, closed also with a lock and key, secured in"
"x121","all probability a cavity of importance."
"x121",""
"x121","Catherine's heart beat quick, but her courage did not fail her. With a"
"x121","cheek flushed by hope, and an eye straining with curiosity, her fingers"
"x121","grasped the handle of a drawer and drew it forth. It was entirely empty."
"x121","With less alarm and greater eagerness she seized a second, a third, a"
"x121","fourth; each was equally empty. Not one was left unsearched, and in not"
"x121","one was anything found. Well read in the art of concealing a treasure,"
"x121","the possibility of false linings to the drawers did not escape her, and"
"x121","she felt round each with anxious acuteness in vain. The place in the"
"x121","middle alone remained now unexplored; and though she had ""never from"
"x121","the first had the smallest idea of finding anything in any part of the"
"x121","cabinet, and was not in the least disappointed at her ill success thus"
"x121","far, it would be foolish not to examine it thoroughly while she was"
"x121","about it."" It was some time however before she could unfasten the door,"
"x121","the same difficulty occurring in the management of this inner lock as of"
"x121","the outer; but at length it did open; and not vain, as hitherto, was her"
"x121","search; her quick eyes directly fell on a roll of paper pushed back"
"x121","into the further part of the cavity, apparently for concealment, and"
"x121","her feelings at that moment were indescribable. Her heart fluttered, her"
"x121","knees trembled, and her cheeks grew pale. She seized, with an unsteady"
"x121","hand, the precious manuscript, for half a glance sufficed to ascertain"
"x121","written characters; and while she acknowledged with awful sensations"
"x121","this striking exemplification of what Henry had foretold, resolved"
"x121","instantly to peruse every line before she attempted to rest."
"x121",""
"x121","The dimness of the light her candle emitted made her turn to it with"
"x121","alarm; but there was no danger of its sudden extinction; it had yet some"
"x121","hours to burn; and that she might not have any greater difficulty in"
"x121","distinguishing the writing than what its ancient date might occasion,"
"x121","she hastily snuffed it. Alas! It was snuffed and extinguished in one. A"
"x121","lamp could not have expired with more awful effect. Catherine, for a"
"x121","few moments, was motionless with horror. It was done completely; not a"
"x121","remnant of light in the wick could give hope to the rekindling breath."
"x121","Darkness impenetrable and immovable filled the room. A violent gust"
"x121","of wind, rising with sudden fury, added fresh horror to the moment."
"x121","Catherine trembled from head to foot. In the pause which succeeded, a"
"x121","sound like receding footsteps and the closing of a distant door struck"
"x121","on her affrighted ear. Human nature could support no more. A cold sweat"
"x121","stood on her forehead, the manuscript fell from her hand, and groping"
"x121","her way to the bed, she jumped hastily in, and sought some suspension of"
"x121","agony by creeping far underneath the clothes. To close her eyes in"
"x121","sleep that night, she felt must be entirely out of the question. With"
"x121","a curiosity so justly awakened, and feelings in every way so agitated,"
"x121","repose must be absolutely impossible. The storm too abroad so dreadful!"
"x121","She had not been used to feel alarm from wind, but now every blast"
"x121","seemed fraught with awful intelligence. The manuscript so wonderfully"
"x121","found, so wonderfully accomplishing the morning's prediction, how was it"
"x121","to be accounted for? What could it contain? To whom could it relate?"
"x121","By what means could it have been so long concealed? And how singularly"
"x121","strange that it should fall to her lot to discover it! Till she had made"
"x121","herself mistress of its contents, however, she could have neither repose"
"x121","nor comfort; and with the sun's first rays she was determined to peruse"
"x121","it. But many were the tedious hours which must yet intervene. She"
"x121","shuddered, tossed about in her bed, and envied every quiet sleeper. The"
"x121","storm still raged, and various were the noises, more terrific even"
"x121","than the wind, which struck at intervals on her startled ear. The very"
"x121","curtains of her bed seemed at one moment in motion, and at another"
"x121","the lock of her door was agitated, as if by the attempt of somebody to"
"x121","enter. Hollow murmurs seemed to creep along the gallery, and more than"
"x121","once her blood was chilled by the sound of distant moans. Hour after"
"x121","hour passed away, and the wearied Catherine had heard three proclaimed"
"x121","by all the clocks in the house before the tempest subsided or she"
"x121","unknowingly fell fast asleep."

"x121",""
"x121","The housemaid's folding back her window-shutters at eight o'clock the"
"x121","next day was the sound which first roused Catherine; and she opened her"
"x121","eyes, wondering that they could ever have been closed, on objects of"
"x121","cheerfulness; her fire was already burning, and a bright morning"
"x121","had succeeded the tempest of the night. Instantaneously, with the"
"x121","consciousness of existence, returned her recollection of the manuscript;"
"x121","and springing from the bed in the very moment of the maid's going away,"
"x121","she eagerly collected every scattered sheet which had burst from the"
"x121","roll on its falling to the ground, and flew back to enjoy the luxury"
"x121","of their perusal on her pillow. She now plainly saw that she must not"
"x121","expect a manuscript of equal length with the generality of what she had"
"x121","shuddered over in books, for the roll, seeming to consist entirely of"
"x121","small disjointed sheets, was altogether but of trifling size, and much"
"x121","less than she had supposed it to be at first."
"x121",""
"x121","Her greedy eye glanced rapidly over a page. She started at its import."
"x121","Could it be possible, or did not her senses play her false? An inventory"
"x121","of linen, in coarse and modern characters, seemed all that was before"
"x121","her! If the evidence of sight might be trusted, she held a washing-bill"
"x121","in her hand. She seized another sheet, and saw the same articles with"
"x121","little variation; a third, a fourth, and a fifth presented nothing"
"x121","new. Shirts, stockings, cravats, and waistcoats faced her in each. Two"
"x121","others, penned by the same hand, marked an expenditure scarcely more"
"x121","interesting, in letters, hair-powder, shoe-string, and breeches-ball."
"x121","And the larger sheet, which had enclosed the rest, seemed by its first"
"x121","cramp line, ""To poultice chestnut mare""--a farrier's bill! Such was the"
"x121","collection of papers (left perhaps, as she could then suppose, by the"
"x121","negligence of a servant in the place whence she had taken them) which"
"x121","had filled her with expectation and alarm, and robbed her of half her"
"x121","night's rest! She felt humbled to the dust. Could not the adventure of"
"x121","the chest have taught her wisdom? A corner of it, catching her eye as"
"x121","she lay, seemed to rise up in judgment against her. Nothing could now"
"x121","be clearer than the absurdity of her recent fancies. To suppose that a"
"x121","manuscript of many generations back could have remained undiscovered in"
"x121","a room such as that, so modern, so habitable!--Or that she should be the"
"x121","first to possess the skill of unlocking a cabinet, the key of which was"
"x121","open to all!"
"x121",""
"x121","How could she have so imposed on herself? Heaven forbid that Henry"
"x121","Tilney should ever know her folly! And it was in a great measure his"
"x121","own doing, for had not the cabinet appeared so exactly to agree with his"
"x121","description of her adventures, she should never have felt the smallest"
"x121","curiosity about it. This was the only comfort that occurred. Impatient"
"x121","to get rid of those hateful evidences of her folly, those detestable"
"x121","papers then scattered over the bed, she rose directly, and folding them"
"x121","up as nearly as possible in the same shape as before, returned them"
"x121","to the same spot within the cabinet, with a very hearty wish that no"
"x121","untoward accident might ever bring them forward again, to disgrace her"
"x121","even with herself."
"x121",""
"x121","Why the locks should have been so difficult to open, however, was still"
"x121","something remarkable, for she could now manage them with perfect ease."
"x121","In this there was surely something mysterious, and she indulged in the"
"x121","flattering suggestion for half a minute, till the possibility of the"
"x121","door's having been at first unlocked, and of being herself its fastener,"
"x121","darted into her head, and cost her another blush."
"x121",""
"x121","She got away as soon as she could from a room in which her conduct"
"x121","produced such unpleasant reflections, and found her way with all speed"
"x121","to the breakfast-parlour, as it had been pointed out to her by Miss"
"x121","Tilney the evening before. Henry was alone in it; and his immediate hope"
"x121","of her having been undisturbed by the tempest, with an arch reference"
"x121","to the character of the building they inhabited, was rather distressing."
"x121","For the world would she not have her weakness suspected, and yet,"
"x121","unequal to an absolute falsehood, was constrained to acknowledge that"
"x121","the wind had kept her awake a little. ""But we have a charming morning"
"x121","after it,"" she added, desiring to get rid of the subject; ""and storms"
"x121","and sleeplessness are nothing when they are over. What beautiful"
"x121","hyacinths! I have just learnt to love a hyacinth."""

"x121","""And how might you learn? By accident or argument?"""
"x121",""
"x121","""Your sister taught me; I cannot tell how. Mrs. Allen used to take"

"x121","sex, as a means of getting you out of doors, and tempting you to more"
"x121","frequent exercise than you would otherwise take. And though the love"
"x121","of a hyacinth may be rather domestic, who can tell, the sentiment once"
"x121","raised, but you may in time come to love a rose?"""
"x121",""
"x121","""But I do not want any such pursuit to get me out of doors. The pleasure"

"x121",""
"x121","""At any rate, however, I am pleased that you have learnt to love"

"x121","Catherine was saved the embarrassment of attempting an answer by the"
"x121","entrance of the general, whose smiling compliments announced a happy"
"x121","state of mind, but whose gentle hint of sympathetic early rising did not"
"x121","advance her composure."
"x121",""
"x121","The elegance of the breakfast set forced itself on Catherine's notice"
"x121","when they were seated at table; and, luckily, it had been the general's"
"x121","choice. He was enchanted by her approbation of his taste, confessed it"
"x121","to be neat and simple, thought it right to encourage the manufacture of"
"x121","his country; and for his part, to his uncritical palate, the tea was as"
"x121","well flavoured from the clay of Staffordshire, as from that of Dresden"
"x121","or Save. But this was quite an old set, purchased two years ago."
"x121","The manufacture was much improved since that time; he had seen some"
"x121","beautiful specimens when last in town, and had he not been perfectly"
"x121","without vanity of that kind, might have been tempted to order a new"
"x121","set. He trusted, however, that an opportunity might ere long occur of"
"x121","selecting one--though not for himself. Catherine was probably the only"
"x121","one of the party who did not understand him."
"x121",""
"x121","Shortly after breakfast Henry left them for Woodston, where business"
"x121","required and would keep him two or three days. They all attended in"
"x121","the hall to see him mount his horse, and immediately on re-entering the"
"x121","breakfast-room, Catherine walked to a window in the hope of catching"
"x121","another glimpse of his figure. ""This is a somewhat heavy call upon your"
"x121","brother's fortitude,"" observed the general to Eleanor. ""Woodston will"
"x121","make but a sombre appearance today."""

"x121","""What say you, Eleanor? Speak your opinion, for ladies can best tell the"

"x121","acknowledged by the most impartial eye to have many recommendations. The"
"x121","house stands among fine meadows facing the south-east, with an excellent"
"x121","kitchen-garden in the same aspect; the walls surrounding which I built"
"x121","and stocked myself about ten years ago, for the benefit of my son. It"
"x121","is a family living, Miss Morland; and the property in the place being"
"x121","chiefly my own, you may believe I take care that it shall not be a bad"
"x121","one. Did Henry's income depend solely on this living, he would not be"
"x121","ill-provided for. Perhaps it may seem odd, that with only two younger"
"x121","children, I should think any profession necessary for him; and certainly"
"x121","there are moments when we could all wish him disengaged from every tie"
"x121","of business. But though I may not exactly make converts of you young"
"x121","ladies, I am sure your father, Miss Morland, would agree with me in"
"x121","thinking it expedient to give every young man some employment. The"
"x121","money is nothing, it is not an object, but employment is the thing."
"x121","Even Frederick, my eldest son, you see, who will perhaps inherit as"
"x121","considerable a landed property as any private man in the county, has his"
"x121","profession."""

"x121","The imposing effect of this last argument was equal to his wishes. The"
"x121","silence of the lady proved it to be unanswerable."
"x121",""
"x121","Something had been said the evening before of her being shown over the"
"x121","house, and he now offered himself as her conductor; and though Catherine"
"x121","had hoped to explore it accompanied only by his daughter, it was a"
"x121","proposal of too much happiness in itself, under any circumstances, not"
"x121","to be gladly accepted; for she had been already eighteen hours in the"
"x121","abbey, and had seen only a few of its rooms. The netting-box, just"
"x121","leisurely drawn forth, was closed with joyful haste, and she was ready"
"x121","to attend him in a moment. ""And when they had gone over the house, he"
"x121","promised himself moreover the pleasure of accompanying her into the"
"x121","shrubberies and garden."" She curtsied her acquiescence. ""But perhaps"
"x121","it might be more agreeable to her to make those her first object."
"x121","The weather was at present favourable, and at this time of year the"
"x121","uncertainty was very great of its continuing so. Which would she prefer?"
"x121","He was equally at her service. Which did his daughter think would most"
"x121","accord with her fair friend's wishes? But he thought he could discern."
"x121","Yes, he certainly read in Miss Morland's eyes a judicious desire of"
"x121","making use of the present smiling weather. But when did she judge amiss?"
"x121","The abbey would be always safe and dry. He yielded implicitly, and"
"x121","would fetch his hat and attend them in a moment."" He left the room,"
"x121","and Catherine, with a disappointed, anxious face, began to speak of her"
"x121","unwillingness that he should be taking them out of doors against his own"
"x121","inclination, under a mistaken idea of pleasing her; but she was stopped"
"x121","by Miss Tilney's saying, with a little confusion, ""I believe it will be"
"x121","wisest to take the morning while it is so fine; and do not be uneasy on"
"x121","my father's account; he always walks out at this time of day."""

"x121","Catherine did not exactly know how this was to be understood. Why"
"x121","was Miss Tilney embarrassed? Could there be any unwillingness on the"
"x121","general's side to show her over the abbey? The proposal was his own. And"
"x121","was not it odd that he should always take his walk so early? Neither her"
"x121","father nor Mr. Allen did so. It was certainly very provoking. She was"
"x121","all impatience to see the house, and had scarcely any curiosity about"
"x121","the grounds. If Henry had been with them indeed! But now she should not"
"x121","know what was picturesque when she saw it. Such were her thoughts, but"
"x121","she kept them to herself, and put on her bonnet in patient discontent."
"x121",""
"x121","She was struck, however, beyond her expectation, by the grandeur of"
"x121","the abbey, as she saw it for the first time from the lawn. The whole"
"x121","building enclosed a large court; and two sides of the quadrangle, rich"
"x121","in Gothic ornaments, stood forward for admiration. The remainder was"
"x121","shut off by knolls of old trees, or luxuriant plantations, and the steep"
"x121","woody hills rising behind, to give it shelter, were beautiful even in"
"x121","the leafless month of March. Catherine had seen nothing to compare with"
"x121","it; and her feelings of delight were so strong, that without waiting for"
"x121","any better authority, she boldly burst forth in wonder and praise. The"
"x121","general listened with assenting gratitude; and it seemed as if his own"
"x121","estimation of Northanger had waited unfixed till that hour."

"x121","The kitchen-garden was to be next admired, and he led the way to it"

"x121","The walls seemed countless in number, endless in length; a village of"
"x121","hot-houses seemed to arise among them, and a whole parish to be at"
"x121","work within the enclosure. The general was flattered by her looks of"
"x121","surprise, which told him almost as plainly, as he soon forced her to"
"x121","tell him in words, that she had never seen any gardens at all equal to"
"x121","them before; and he then modestly owned that, ""without any ambition of"

"x121","Morland were not tired. ""But where are you going, Eleanor? Why do you"

"x121","himself, however, from attending them: ""The rays of the sun were not too"

"x121","wonder at her choice. But her memory endears it now."""
"x121",""
"x121","""And ought it not,"" reflected Catherine, ""to endear it to her husband?"
"x121","Yet the general would not enter it."" Miss Tilney continuing silent, she"
"x121","ventured to say, ""Her death must have been a great affliction!"""
"x121",""
"x121","""A great and increasing one,"" replied the other, in a low voice. ""I was"
"x121","only thirteen when it happened; and though I felt my loss perhaps as"
"x121","strongly as one so young could feel it, I did not, I could not, then"
"x121","know what a loss it was."" She stopped for a moment, and then added, with"
"x121","great firmness, ""I have no sister, you know--and though Henry--though my"
"x121","brothers are very affectionate, and Henry is a great deal here, which I"
"x121","am most thankful for, it is impossible for me not to be often solitary."""
"x121",""
"x121","""To be sure you must miss him very much."""
"x121",""
"x121","""A mother would have been always present. A mother would have been a"
"x121","constant friend; her influence would have been beyond all other."""
"x121",""
"x121","""Was she a very charming woman? Was she handsome? Was there any picture"
"x121","of her in the abbey? And why had she been so partial to that grove? Was"
"x121","it from dejection of spirits?""--were questions now eagerly poured forth;"
"x121","the first three received a ready affirmative, the two others were passed"
"x121","by; and Catherine's interest in the deceased Mrs. Tilney augmented with"
"x121","every question, whether answered or not. Of her unhappiness in marriage,"
"x121","she felt persuaded. The general certainly had been an unkind husband. He"
"x121","did not love her walk: could he therefore have loved her? And besides,"
"x121","handsome as he was, there was a something in the turn of his features"
"x121","which spoke his not having behaved well to her."
"x121",""
"x121","""Her picture, I suppose,"" blushing at the consummate art of her own"
"x121","question, ""hangs in your father's room?"""
"x121",""
"x121","""No; it was intended for the drawing-room; but my father was"
"x121","dissatisfied with the painting, and for some time it had no place."
"x121","Soon after her death I obtained it for my own, and hung it in my"
"x121","bed-chamber--where I shall be happy to show it you; it is very like."""
"x121","Here was another proof. A portrait--very like--of a departed wife, not"
"x121","valued by the husband! He must have been dreadfully cruel to her!"
"x121",""
"x121","Catherine attempted no longer to hide from herself the nature of the"
"x121","feelings which, in spite of all his attentions, he had previously"
"x121","excited; and what had been terror and dislike before, was now absolute"
"x121","aversion. Yes, aversion! His cruelty to such a charming woman made him"
"x121","odious to her. She had often read of such characters, characters which"
"x121","Mr. Allen had been used to call unnatural and overdrawn; but here was"
"x121","proof positive of the contrary."
"x121",""
"x121","She had just settled this point when the end of the path brought them"
"x121","directly upon the general; and in spite of all her virtuous indignation,"
"x121","she found herself again obliged to walk with him, listen to him, and"
"x121","even to smile when he smiled. Being no longer able, however, to receive"
"x121","pleasure from the surrounding objects, she soon began to walk with"
"x121","lassitude; the general perceived it, and with a concern for her health,"
"x121","which seemed to reproach her for her opinion of him, was most urgent"
"x121","for returning with his daughter to the house. He would follow them in"
"x121","a quarter of an hour. Again they parted--but Eleanor was called back in"
"x121","half a minute to receive a strict charge against taking her friend round"
"x121","the abbey till his return. This second instance of his anxiety to delay"
"x121","what she so much wished for struck Catherine as very remarkable."

"x121","CHAPTER 23"
"x121",""
"x121",""
"x121","An hour passed away before the general came in, spent, on the part of"
"x121","his young guest, in no very favourable consideration of his character."
"x121","""This lengthened absence, these solitary rambles, did not speak a mind"
"x121","at ease, or a conscience void of reproach."" At length he appeared; and,"
"x121","whatever might have been the gloom of his meditations, he could still"
"x121","smile with them. Miss Tilney, understanding in part her friend's"
"x121","curiosity to see the house, soon revived the subject; and her father"
"x121","being, contrary to Catherine's expectations, unprovided with any"
"x121","pretence for further delay, beyond that of stopping five minutes to"
"x121","order refreshments to be in the room by their return, was at last ready"
"x121","to escort them."
"x121",""
"x121","They set forward; and, with a grandeur of air, a dignified step,"
"x121","which caught the eye, but could not shake the doubts of the well-read"
"x121","Catherine, he led the way across the hall, through the common"
"x121","drawing-room and one useless antechamber, into a room magnificent both"
"x121","in size and furniture--the real drawing-room, used only with company of"
"x121","consequence. It was very noble--very grand--very charming!--was all that"
"x121","Catherine had to say, for her indiscriminating eye scarcely discerned"
"x121","the colour of the satin; and all minuteness of praise, all praise"
"x121","that had much meaning, was supplied by the general: the costliness or"
"x121","elegance of any room's fitting-up could be nothing to her; she cared for"
"x121","no furniture of a more modern date than the fifteenth century. When the"
"x121","general had satisfied his own curiosity, in a close examination of every"
"x121","well-known ornament, they proceeded into the library, an apartment, in"
"x121","its way, of equal magnificence, exhibiting a collection of books, on"
"x121","which an humble man might have looked with pride. Catherine heard,"
"x121","admired, and wondered with more genuine feeling than before--gathered"
"x121","all that she could from this storehouse of knowledge, by running over"
"x121","the titles of half a shelf, and was ready to proceed. But suites of"
"x121","apartments did not spring up with her wishes. Large as was the building,"
"x121","she had already visited the greatest part; though, on being told that,"
"x121","with the addition of the kitchen, the six or seven rooms she had now"
"x121","seen surrounded three sides of the court, she could scarcely believe it,"
"x121","or overcome the suspicion of there being many chambers secreted. It was"
"x121","some relief, however, that they were to return to the rooms in common"
"x121","use, by passing through a few of less importance, looking into the"
"x121","court, which, with occasional passages, not wholly unintricate,"
"x121","connected the different sides; and she was further soothed in her"
"x121","progress by being told that she was treading what had once been a"
"x121","cloister, having traces of cells pointed out, and observing several"
"x121","doors that were neither opened nor explained to her--by finding herself"
"x121","successively in a billiard-room, and in the general's private apartment,"
"x121","without comprehending their connection, or being able to turn aright"
"x121","when she left them; and lastly, by passing through a dark little room,"
"x121","owning Henry's authority, and strewed with his litter of books, guns,"
"x121","and greatcoats."
"x121",""
"x121","From the dining-room, of which, though already seen, and always to be"
"x121","seen at five o'clock, the general could not forgo the pleasure of pacing"
"x121","out the length, for the more certain information of Miss Morland, as"
"x121","to what she neither doubted nor cared for, they proceeded by quick"
"x121","communication to the kitchen--the ancient kitchen of the convent, rich"
"x121","in the massy walls and smoke of former days, and in the stoves and hot"
"x121","closets of the present. The general's improving hand had not loitered"
"x121","here: every modern invention to facilitate the labour of the cooks had"
"x121","been adopted within this, their spacious theatre; and, when the genius"
"x121","of others had failed, his own had often produced the perfection wanted."
"x121","His endowments of this spot alone might at any time have placed him high"
"x121","among the benefactors of the convent."
"x121",""
"x121","With the walls of the kitchen ended all the antiquity of the abbey; the"
"x121","fourth side of the quadrangle having, on account of its decaying state,"
"x121","been removed by the general's father, and the present erected in its"
"x121","place. All that was venerable ceased here. The new building was not"
"x121","only new, but declared itself to be so; intended only for offices, and"
"x121","enclosed behind by stable-yards, no uniformity of architecture had been"
"x121","thought necessary. Catherine could have raved at the hand which had"
"x121","swept away what must have been beyond the value of all the rest, for the"
"x121","purposes of mere domestic economy; and would willingly have been spared"
"x121","the mortification of a walk through scenes so fallen, had the general"
"x121","allowed it; but if he had a vanity, it was in the arrangement of his"
"x121","offices; and as he was convinced that, to a mind like Miss Morland's,"
"x121","a view of the accommodations and comforts, by which the labours of her"
"x121","inferiors were softened, must always be gratifying, he should make"
"x121","no apology for leading her on. They took a slight survey of all; and"
"x121","Catherine was impressed, beyond her expectation, by their multiplicity"
"x121","and their convenience. The purposes for which a few shapeless pantries"
"x121","and a comfortless scullery were deemed sufficient at Fullerton, were"
"x121","here carried on in appropriate divisions, commodious and roomy. The"
"x121","number of servants continually appearing did not strike her less than"
"x121","the number of their offices. Wherever they went, some pattened girl"
"x121","stopped to curtsy, or some footman in dishabille sneaked off. Yet this"
"x121","was an abbey! How inexpressibly different in these domestic arrangements"
"x121","from such as she had read about--from abbeys and castles, in which,"
"x121","though certainly larger than Northanger, all the dirty work of the house"
"x121","was to be done by two pair of female hands at the utmost. How they could"
"x121","get through it all had often amazed Mrs. Allen; and, when Catherine saw"
"x121","what was necessary here, she began to be amazed herself."
"x121",""
"x121","They returned to the hall, that the chief staircase might be ascended,"
"x121","and the beauty of its wood, and ornaments of rich carving might be"
"x121","pointed out: having gained the top, they turned in an opposite direction"
"x121","from the gallery in which her room lay, and shortly entered one on"
"x121","the same plan, but superior in length and breadth. She was here shown"
"x121","successively into three large bed-chambers, with their dressing-rooms,"
"x121","most completely and handsomely fitted up; everything that money and"
"x121","taste could do, to give comfort and elegance to apartments, had been"
"x121","bestowed on these; and, being furnished within the last five years, they"
"x121","were perfect in all that would be generally pleasing, and wanting in all"
"x121","that could give pleasure to Catherine. As they were surveying the last,"
"x121","the general, after slightly naming a few of the distinguished characters"
"x121","by whom they had at times been honoured, turned with a smiling"
"x121","countenance to Catherine, and ventured to hope that henceforward some of"
"x121","their earliest tenants might be ""our friends from Fullerton."" She felt"
"x121","the unexpected compliment, and deeply regretted the impossibility of"
"x121","thinking well of a man so kindly disposed towards herself, and so full"
"x121","of civility to all her family."
"x121",""
"x121","The gallery was terminated by folding doors, which Miss Tilney,"
"x121","advancing, had thrown open, and passed through, and seemed on the point"
"x121","of doing the same by the first door to the left, in another long reach"
"x121","of gallery, when the general, coming forwards, called her hastily, and,"
"x121","as Catherine thought, rather angrily back, demanding whether she were"
"x121","going?--And what was there more to be seen?--Had not Miss Morland"
"x121","already seen all that could be worth her notice?--And did she not"
"x121","suppose her friend might be glad of some refreshment after so much"
"x121","exercise? Miss Tilney drew back directly, and the heavy doors were"
"x121","closed upon the mortified Catherine, who, having seen, in a momentary"
"x121","glance beyond them, a narrower passage, more numerous openings, and"
"x121","symptoms of a winding staircase, believed herself at last within the"
"x121","reach of something worth her notice; and felt, as she unwillingly paced"
"x121","back the gallery, that she would rather be allowed to examine that end"
"x121","of the house than see all the finery of all the rest. The general's"
"x121","evident desire of preventing such an examination was an additional"
"x121","stimulant. Something was certainly to be concealed; her fancy, though"
"x121","it had trespassed lately once or twice, could not mislead her here;"
"x121","and what that something was, a short sentence of Miss Tilney's, as they"
"x121","followed the general at some distance downstairs, seemed to point out:"
"x121","""I was going to take you into what was my mother's room--the room"
"x121","in which she died--"" were all her words; but few as they were, they"
"x121","conveyed pages of intelligence to Catherine. It was no wonder that the"
"x121","general should shrink from the sight of such objects as that room"
"x121","must contain; a room in all probability never entered by him since the"
"x121","dreadful scene had passed, which released his suffering wife, and left"
"x121","him to the stings of conscience."
"x121",""
"x121","She ventured, when next alone with Eleanor, to express her wish of being"
"x121","permitted to see it, as well as all the rest of that side of the house;"
"x121","and Eleanor promised to attend her there, whenever they should have a"
"x121","convenient hour. Catherine understood her: the general must be watched"
"x121","from home, before that room could be entered. ""It remains as it was, I"
"x121","suppose?"" said she, in a tone of feeling."
"x121",""
"x121","""Yes, entirely."""
"x121",""
"x121","""And how long ago may it be that your mother died?"""
"x121",""
"x121","""She has been dead these nine years."" And nine years, Catherine knew,"
"x121","was a trifle of time, compared with what generally elapsed after the"
"x121","death of an injured wife, before her room was put to rights."
"x121",""
"x121","""You were with her, I suppose, to the last?"""
"x121",""
"x121","""No,"" said Miss Tilney, sighing; ""I was unfortunately from home. Her"
"x121","illness was sudden and short; and, before I arrived it was all over."""
"x121",""
"x121","Catherine's blood ran cold with the horrid suggestions which naturally"
"x121","sprang from these words. Could it be possible? Could Henry's father--?"
"x121","And yet how many were the examples to justify even the blackest"
"x121","suspicions! And, when she saw him in the evening, while she worked"
"x121","with her friend, slowly pacing the drawing-room for an hour together in"
"x121","silent thoughtfulness, with downcast eyes and contracted brow, she felt"
"x121","secure from all possibility of wronging him. It was the air and attitude"
"x121","of a Montoni! What could more plainly speak the gloomy workings of a"
"x121","mind not wholly dead to every sense of humanity, in its fearful review"
"x121","of past scenes of guilt? Unhappy man! And the anxiousness of her spirits"
"x121","directed her eyes towards his figure so repeatedly, as to catch Miss"
"x121","Tilney's notice. ""My father,"" she whispered, ""often walks about the room"
"x121","in this way; it is nothing unusual."""
"x121",""
"x121","""So much the worse!"" thought Catherine; such ill-timed exercise was of a"
"x121","piece with the strange unseasonableness of his morning walks, and boded"
"x121","nothing good."
"x121",""
"x121","After an evening, the little variety and seeming length of which made"
"x121","her peculiarly sensible of Henry's importance among them, she was"
"x121","heartily glad to be dismissed; though it was a look from the general not"
"x121","designed for her observation which sent his daughter to the bell."
"x121","When the butler would have lit his master's candle, however, he was"
"x121","forbidden. The latter was not going to retire. ""I have many pamphlets to"
"x121","finish,"" said he to Catherine, ""before I can close my eyes, and perhaps"
"x121","may be poring over the affairs of the nation for hours after you are"
"x121","asleep. Can either of us be more meetly employed? My eyes will be"
"x121","blinding for the good of others, and yours preparing by rest for future"
"x121","mischief."""
"x121",""
"x121","But neither the business alleged, nor the magnificent compliment,"
"x121","could win Catherine from thinking that some very different object must"
"x121","occasion so serious a delay of proper repose. To be kept up for hours,"
"x121","after the family were in bed, by stupid pamphlets was not very likely."
"x121","There must be some deeper cause: something was to be done which could"
"x121","be done only while the household slept; and the probability that Mrs."
"x121","Tilney yet lived, shut up for causes unknown, and receiving from the"
"x121","pitiless hands of her husband a nightly supply of coarse food, was the"
"x121","conclusion which necessarily followed. Shocking as was the idea, it"
"x121","was at least better than a death unfairly hastened, as, in the natural"
"x121","course of things, she must ere long be released. The suddenness of her"
"x121","reputed illness, the absence of her daughter, and probably of her other"
"x121","children, at the time--all favoured the supposition of her imprisonment."
"x121","Its origin--jealousy perhaps, or wanton cruelty--was yet to be"
"x121","unravelled."
"x121",""
"x121","In revolving these matters, while she undressed, it suddenly struck her"
"x121","as not unlikely that she might that morning have passed near the very"
"x121","spot of this unfortunate woman's confinement--might have been within"
"x121","a few paces of the cell in which she languished out her days; for what"
"x121","part of the abbey could be more fitted for the purpose than that which"
"x121","yet bore the traces of monastic division? In the high-arched passage,"
"x121","paved with stone, which already she had trodden with peculiar awe, she"
"x121","well remembered the doors of which the general had given no account. To"
"x121","what might not those doors lead? In support of the plausibility of this"
"x121","conjecture, it further occurred to her that the forbidden gallery, in"
"x121","which lay the apartments of the unfortunate Mrs. Tilney, must be, as"
"x121","certainly as her memory could guide her, exactly over this suspected"
"x121","range of cells, and the staircase by the side of those apartments of"
"x121","which she had caught a transient glimpse, communicating by some"
"x121","secret means with those cells, might well have favoured the barbarous"
"x121","proceedings of her husband. Down that staircase she had perhaps been"
"x121","conveyed in a state of well-prepared insensibility!"
"x121",""
"x121","Catherine sometimes started at the boldness of her own surmises, and"
"x121","sometimes hoped or feared that she had gone too far; but they were"
"x121","supported by such appearances as made their dismissal impossible."
"x121",""
"x121","The side of the quadrangle, in which she supposed the guilty scene to be"
"x121","acting, being, according to her belief, just opposite her own, it struck"
"x121","her that, if judiciously watched, some rays of light from the general's"
"x121","lamp might glimmer through the lower windows, as he passed to the prison"
"x121","of his wife; and, twice before she stepped into bed, she stole gently"
"x121","from her room to the corresponding window in the gallery, to see if it"
"x121","appeared; but all abroad was dark, and it must yet be too early. The"
"x121","various ascending noises convinced her that the servants must still be"
"x121","up. Till midnight, she supposed it would be in vain to watch; but then,"
"x121","when the clock had struck twelve, and all was quiet, she would, if not"
"x121","quite appalled by darkness, steal out and look once more. The clock"
"x121","struck twelve--and Catherine had been half an hour asleep."

"x121",""
"x121","The next day afforded no opportunity for the proposed examination of the"
"x121","mysterious apartments. It was Sunday, and the whole time between morning"
"x121","and afternoon service was required by the general in exercise abroad or"
"x121","eating cold meat at home; and great as was Catherine's curiosity, her"
"x121","courage was not equal to a wish of exploring them after dinner, either"
"x121","by the fading light of the sky between six and seven o'clock, or by the"
"x121","yet more partial though stronger illumination of a treacherous lamp."
"x121","The day was unmarked therefore by anything to interest her imagination"
"x121","beyond the sight of a very elegant monument to the memory of Mrs."
"x121","Tilney, which immediately fronted the family pew. By that her eye"
"x121","was instantly caught and long retained; and the perusal of the highly"
"x121","strained epitaph, in which every virtue was ascribed to her by the"
"x121","inconsolable husband, who must have been in some way or other her"
"x121","destroyer, affected her even to tears."
"x121",""
"x121","That the general, having erected such a monument, should be able to face"
"x121","it, was not perhaps very strange, and yet that he could sit so boldly"
"x121","collected within its view, maintain so elevated an air, look so"
"x121","fearlessly around, nay, that he should even enter the church, seemed"
"x121","wonderful to Catherine. Not, however, that many instances of beings"
"x121","equally hardened in guilt might not be produced. She could remember"
"x121","dozens who had persevered in every possible vice, going on from crime to"
"x121","crime, murdering whomsoever they chose, without any feeling of humanity"
"x121","or remorse; till a violent death or a religious retirement closed their"
"x121","black career. The erection of the monument itself could not in the"
"x121","smallest degree affect her doubts of Mrs. Tilney's actual decease. Were"
"x121","she even to descend into the family vault where her ashes were supposed"
"x121","to slumber, were she to behold the coffin in which they were said to"
"x121","be enclosed--what could it avail in such a case? Catherine had read too"
"x121","much not to be perfectly aware of the ease with which a waxen figure"
"x121","might be introduced, and a supposititious funeral carried on."
"x121",""
"x121","The succeeding morning promised something better. The general's early"
"x121","walk, ill-timed as it was in every other view, was favourable here; and"
"x121","when she knew him to be out of the house, she directly proposed to Miss"
"x121","Tilney the accomplishment of her promise. Eleanor was ready to oblige"
"x121","her; and Catherine reminding her as they went of another promise, their"
"x121","first visit in consequence was to the portrait in her bed-chamber. It"
"x121","represented a very lovely woman, with a mild and pensive countenance,"
"x121","justifying, so far, the expectations of its new observer; but they were"
"x121","not in every respect answered, for Catherine had depended upon meeting"
"x121","with features, hair, complexion, that should be the very counterpart,"
"x121","the very image, if not of Henry's, of Eleanor's--the only portraits of"
"x121","which she had been in the habit of thinking, bearing always an equal"
"x121","resemblance of mother and child. A face once taken was taken for"
"x121","generations. But here she was obliged to look and consider and study"
"x121","for a likeness. She contemplated it, however, in spite of this drawback,"
"x121","with much emotion, and, but for a yet stronger interest, would have left"
"x121","it unwillingly."
"x121",""
"x121","Her agitation as they entered the great gallery was too much for any"
"x121","endeavour at discourse; she could only look at her companion. Eleanor's"
"x121","countenance was dejected, yet sedate; and its composure spoke her inured"
"x121","to all the gloomy objects to which they were advancing. Again she passed"
"x121","through the folding doors, again her hand was upon the important lock,"
"x121","and Catherine, hardly able to breathe, was turning to close the former"
"x121","with fearful caution, when the figure, the dreaded figure of the general"
"x121","himself at the further end of the gallery, stood before her! The name of"
"x121","""Eleanor"" at the same moment, in his loudest tone, resounded through the"
"x121","building, giving to his daughter the first intimation of his presence,"
"x121","and to Catherine terror upon terror. An attempt at concealment had been"
"x121","her first instinctive movement on perceiving him, yet she could"
"x121","scarcely hope to have escaped his eye; and when her friend, who with an"
"x121","apologizing look darted hastily by her, had joined and disappeared"
"x121","with him, she ran for safety to her own room, and, locking herself"
"x121","in, believed that she should never have courage to go down again. She"
"x121","remained there at least an hour, in the greatest agitation, deeply"
"x121","commiserating the state of her poor friend, and expecting a summons"
"x121","herself from the angry general to attend him in his own apartment. No"
"x121","summons, however, arrived; and at last, on seeing a carriage drive up"
"x121","to the abbey, she was emboldened to descend and meet him under the"
"x121","protection of visitors. The breakfast-room was gay with company; and"
"x121","she was named to them by the general as the friend of his daughter, in"
"x121","a complimentary style, which so well concealed his resentful ire, as to"
"x121","make her feel secure at least of life for the present. And Eleanor,"
"x121","with a command of countenance which did honour to her concern for his"
"x121","character, taking an early occasion of saying to her, ""My father only"
"x121","wanted me to answer a note,"" she began to hope that she had either been"
"x121","unseen by the general, or that from some consideration of policy she"
"x121","should be allowed to suppose herself so. Upon this trust she dared still"
"x121","to remain in his presence, after the company left them, and nothing"
"x121","occurred to disturb it."
"x121",""
"x121","In the course of this morning's reflections, she came to a resolution"
"x121","of making her next attempt on the forbidden door alone. It would be much"
"x121","better in every respect that Eleanor should know nothing of the matter."
"x121","To involve her in the danger of a second detection, to court her into"
"x121","an apartment which must wring her heart, could not be the office of a"
"x121","friend. The general's utmost anger could not be to herself what it might"
"x121","be to a daughter; and, besides, she thought the examination itself"
"x121","would be more satisfactory if made without any companion. It would be"
"x121","impossible to explain to Eleanor the suspicions, from which the other"
"x121","had, in all likelihood, been hitherto happily exempt; nor could she"
"x121","therefore, in her presence, search for those proofs of the general's"
"x121","cruelty, which however they might yet have escaped discovery, she felt"
"x121","confident of somewhere drawing forth, in the shape of some fragmented"
"x121","journal, continued to the last gasp. Of the way to the apartment she was"
"x121","now perfectly mistress; and as she wished to get it over before Henry's"
"x121","return, who was expected on the morrow, there was no time to be lost."
"x121","The day was bright, her courage high; at four o'clock, the sun was now"
"x121","two hours above the horizon, and it would be only her retiring to dress"
"x121","half an hour earlier than usual."
"x121",""
"x121","It was done; and Catherine found herself alone in the gallery before the"
"x121","clocks had ceased to strike. It was no time for thought; she hurried"
"x121","on, slipped with the least possible noise through the folding doors,"
"x121","and without stopping to look or breathe, rushed forward to the one in"
"x121","question. The lock yielded to her hand, and, luckily, with no sullen"
"x121","sound that could alarm a human being. On tiptoe she entered; the room"
"x121","was before her; but it was some minutes before she could advance another"
"x121","step. She beheld what fixed her to the spot and agitated every feature."
"x121","She saw a large, well-proportioned apartment, an handsome dimity bed,"
"x121","arranged as unoccupied with an housemaid's care, a bright Bath stove,"
"x121","mahogany wardrobes, and neatly painted chairs, on which the warm beams"
"x121","of a western sun gaily poured through two sash windows! Catherine had"
"x121","expected to have her feelings worked, and worked they were. Astonishment"
"x121","and doubt first seized them; and a shortly succeeding ray of common"
"x121","sense added some bitter emotions of shame. She could not be mistaken"
"x121","as to the room; but how grossly mistaken in everything else!--in Miss"
"x121","Tilney's meaning, in her own calculation! This apartment, to which she"
"x121","had given a date so ancient, a position so awful, proved to be one end"
"x121","of what the general's father had built. There were two other doors in"
"x121","the chamber, leading probably into dressing-closets; but she had no"
"x121","inclination to open either. Would the veil in which Mrs. Tilney had last"
"x121","walked, or the volume in which she had last read, remain to tell what"
"x121","nothing else was allowed to whisper? No: whatever might have been the"
"x121","general's crimes, he had certainly too much wit to let them sue for"
"x121","detection. She was sick of exploring, and desired but to be safe in her"
"x121","own room, with her own heart only privy to its folly; and she was on"
"x121","the point of retreating as softly as she had entered, when the sound of"
"x121","footsteps, she could hardly tell where, made her pause and tremble."
"x121","To be found there, even by a servant, would be unpleasant; but by the"
"x121","general (and he seemed always at hand when least wanted), much worse!"
"x121","She listened--the sound had ceased; and resolving not to lose a"
"x121","moment, she passed through and closed the door. At that instant a door"
"x121","underneath was hastily opened; someone seemed with swift steps to ascend"
"x121","the stairs, by the head of which she had yet to pass before she could"
"x121","gain the gallery. She had no power to move. With a feeling of terror"
"x121","not very definable, she fixed her eyes on the staircase, and in a few"
"x121","moments it gave Henry to her view. ""Mr. Tilney!"" she exclaimed in a"
"x121","voice of more than common astonishment. He looked astonished too. ""Good"
"x121","God!"" she continued, not attending to his address. ""How came you here?"
"x121","How came you up that staircase?"""
"x121",""
"x121","""How came I up that staircase!"" he replied, greatly surprised. ""Because"
"x121","it is my nearest way from the stable-yard to my own chamber; and why"
"x121","should I not come up it?"""
"x121",""
"x121","Catherine recollected herself, blushed deeply, and could say no more. He"
"x121","seemed to be looking in her countenance for that explanation which her"
"x121","lips did not afford. She moved on towards the gallery. ""And may I not,"
"x121","in my turn,"" said he, as he pushed back the folding doors, ""ask how you"
"x121","came here? This passage is at least as extraordinary a road from the"
"x121","breakfast-parlour to your apartment, as that staircase can be from the"
"x121","stables to mine."""
"x121",""
"x121","""I have been,"" said Catherine, looking down, ""to see your mother's"
"x121","room."""
"x121",""
"x121","""My mother's room! Is there anything extraordinary to be seen there?"""
"x121",""
"x121","""No, nothing at all. I thought you did not mean to come back till"
"x121","tomorrow."""
"x121",""
"x121","""I did not expect to be able to return sooner, when I went away; but"
"x121","three hours ago I had the pleasure of finding nothing to detain me. You"
"x121","look pale. I am afraid I alarmed you by running so fast up those stairs."
"x121","Perhaps you did not know--you were not aware of their leading from the"
"x121","offices in common use?"""
"x121",""
"x121","""No, I was not. You have had a very fine day for your ride."""
"x121",""
"x121","""Very; and does Eleanor leave you to find your way into all the rooms in"
"x121","the house by yourself?"""
"x121",""
"x121","""Oh! No; she showed me over the greatest part on Saturday--and we were"
"x121","coming here to these rooms--but only""--dropping her voice--""your father"
"x121","was with us."""
"x121",""
"x121","""And that prevented you,"" said Henry, earnestly regarding her. ""Have you"
"x121","looked into all the rooms in that passage?"""
"x121",""
"x121","""No, I only wanted to see--Is not it very late? I must go and dress."""
"x121",""
"x121","""It is only a quarter past four"" showing his watch--""and you are not now"
"x121","in Bath. No theatre, no rooms to prepare for. Half an hour at Northanger"
"x121","must be enough."""
"x121",""
"x121","She could not contradict it, and therefore suffered herself to be"
"x121","detained, though her dread of further questions made her, for the first"
"x121","time in their acquaintance, wish to leave him. They walked slowly up the"
"x121","gallery. ""Have you had any letter from Bath since I saw you?"""
"x121",""
"x121","""No, and I am very much surprised. Isabella promised so faithfully to"
"x121","write directly."""
"x121",""
"x121","""Promised so faithfully! A faithful promise! That puzzles me. I have"
"x121","heard of a faithful performance. But a faithful promise--the fidelity"
"x121","of promising! It is a power little worth knowing, however, since it can"
"x121","deceive and pain you. My mother's room is very commodious, is it not?"
"x121","Large and cheerful-looking, and the dressing-closets so well disposed!"
"x121","It always strikes me as the most comfortable apartment in the house, and"
"x121","I rather wonder that Eleanor should not take it for her own. She sent"
"x121","you to look at it, I suppose?"""
"x121",""
"x121","""No."""
"x121",""
"x121","""It has been your own doing entirely?"" Catherine said nothing. After a"
"x121","short silence, during which he had closely observed her, he added, ""As"
"x121","there is nothing in the room in itself to raise curiosity, this must"
"x121","have proceeded from a sentiment of respect for my mother's character,"
"x121","as described by Eleanor, which does honour to her memory. The world, I"
"x121","believe, never saw a better woman. But it is not often that virtue can"
"x121","boast an interest such as this. The domestic, unpretending merits of a"
"x121","person never known do not often create that kind of fervent, venerating"
"x121","tenderness which would prompt a visit like yours. Eleanor, I suppose,"
"x121","has talked of her a great deal?"""
"x121",""
"x121","""Yes, a great deal. That is--no, not much, but what she did say was very"
"x121","interesting. Her dying so suddenly"" (slowly, and with hesitation it"
"x121","was spoken), ""and you--none of you being at home--and your father, I"
"x121","thought--perhaps had not been very fond of her."""
"x121",""
"x121","""And from these circumstances,"" he replied (his quick eye"
"x121","fixed on hers), ""you infer perhaps the probability of some"
"x121","negligence--some""--(involuntarily she shook her head)--""or it may be--of"
"x121","something still less pardonable."" She raised her eyes towards him"
"x121","more fully than she had ever done before. ""My mother's illness,"" he"
"x121","continued, ""the seizure which ended in her death, was sudden. The malady"
"x121","itself, one from which she had often suffered, a bilious fever--its"
"x121","cause therefore constitutional. On the third day, in short, as soon as"
"x121","she could be prevailed on, a physician attended her, a very respectable"
"x121","man, and one in whom she had always placed great confidence. Upon his"
"x121","opinion of her danger, two others were called in the next day, and"
"x121","remained in almost constant attendance for four and twenty hours. On the"
"x121","fifth day she died. During the progress of her disorder, Frederick and I"
"x121","(we were both at home) saw her repeatedly; and from our own observation"
"x121","can bear witness to her having received every possible attention"
"x121","which could spring from the affection of those about her, or which her"
"x121","situation in life could command. Poor Eleanor was absent, and at such a"
"x121","distance as to return only to see her mother in her coffin."""
"x121",""
"x121","""But your father,"" said Catherine, ""was he afflicted?"""
"x121",""
"x121","""For a time, greatly so. You have erred in supposing him not attached"
"x121","to her. He loved her, I am persuaded, as well as it was possible for him"
"x121","to--we have not all, you know, the same tenderness of disposition--and"
"x121","I will not pretend to say that while she lived, she might not often have"
"x121","had much to bear, but though his temper injured her, his judgment never"
"x121","did. His value of her was sincere; and, if not permanently, he was truly"
"x121","afflicted by her death."""
"x121",""
"x121","""I am very glad of it,"" said Catherine; ""it would have been very"
"x121","shocking!"""
"x121",""
"x121","""If I understand you rightly, you had formed a surmise of such horror as"
"x121","I have hardly words to--Dear Miss Morland, consider the dreadful nature"
"x121","of the suspicions you have entertained. What have you been judging from?"
"x121","Remember the country and the age in which we live. Remember that we are"
"x121","English, that we are Christians. Consult your own understanding, your"
"x121","own sense of the probable, your own observation of what is passing"
"x121","around you. Does our education prepare us for such atrocities? Do our"
"x121","laws connive at them? Could they be perpetrated without being known, in"
"x121","a country like this, where social and literary intercourse is on such a"
"x121","footing, where every man is surrounded by a neighbourhood of voluntary"

"x121","CHAPTER 25"
"x121",""
"x121",""
"x121","The visions of romance were over. Catherine was completely awakened."
"x121","Henry's address, short as it had been, had more thoroughly opened her"
"x121","eyes to the extravagance of her late fancies than all their several"
"x121","disappointments had done. Most grievously was she humbled. Most bitterly"
"x121","did she cry. It was not only with herself that she was sunk--but with"
"x121","Henry. Her folly, which now seemed even criminal, was all exposed to"
"x121","him, and he must despise her forever. The liberty which her imagination"
"x121","had dared to take with the character of his father--could he ever"
"x121","forgive it? The absurdity of her curiosity and her fears--could they"
"x121","ever be forgotten? She hated herself more than she could express. He"
"x121","had--she thought he had, once or twice before this fatal morning, shown"
"x121","something like affection for her. But now--in short, she made herself as"
"x121","miserable as possible for about half an hour, went down when the"
"x121","clock struck five, with a broken heart, and could scarcely give an"
"x121","intelligible answer to Eleanor's inquiry if she was well. The formidable"
"x121","Henry soon followed her into the room, and the only difference in his"
"x121","behaviour to her was that he paid her rather more attention than usual."
"x121","Catherine had never wanted comfort more, and he looked as if he was"
"x121","aware of it."
"x121",""
"x121","The evening wore away with no abatement of this soothing politeness; and"
"x121","her spirits were gradually raised to a modest tranquillity. She did not"
"x121","learn either to forget or defend the past; but she learned to hope that"
"x121","it would never transpire farther, and that it might not cost her Henry's"
"x121","entire regard. Her thoughts being still chiefly fixed on what she had"
"x121","with such causeless terror felt and done, nothing could shortly be"
"x121","clearer than that it had been all a voluntary, self-created delusion,"
"x121","each trifling circumstance receiving importance from an imagination"
"x121","resolved on alarm, and everything forced to bend to one purpose by"
"x121","a mind which, before she entered the abbey, had been craving to be"
"x121","frightened. She remembered with what feelings she had prepared for a"
"x121","knowledge of Northanger. She saw that the infatuation had been created,"
"x121","the mischief settled, long before her quitting Bath, and it seemed as if"
"x121","the whole might be traced to the influence of that sort of reading which"
"x121","she had there indulged."
"x121",""
"x121","Charming as were all Mrs. Radcliffe's works, and charming even as were"
"x121","the works of all her imitators, it was not in them perhaps that human"
"x121","nature, at least in the Midland counties of England, was to be looked"
"x121","for. Of the Alps and Pyrenees, with their pine forests and their vices,"
"x121","they might give a faithful delineation; and Italy, Switzerland, and"
"x121","the south of France might be as fruitful in horrors as they were there"
"x121","represented. Catherine dared not doubt beyond her own country, and even"
"x121","of that, if hard pressed, would have yielded the northern and western"
"x121","extremities. But in the central part of England there was surely some"
"x121","security for the existence even of a wife not beloved, in the laws of"
"x121","the land, and the manners of the age. Murder was not tolerated, servants"
"x121","were not slaves, and neither poison nor sleeping potions to be procured,"
"x121","like rhubarb, from every druggist. Among the Alps and Pyrenees, perhaps,"
"x121","there were no mixed characters. There, such as were not as spotless as"
"x121","an angel might have the dispositions of a fiend. But in England it was"
"x121","not so; among the English, she believed, in their hearts and habits,"
"x121","there was a general though unequal mixture of good and bad. Upon this"
"x121","conviction, she would not be surprised if even in Henry and Eleanor"
"x121","Tilney, some slight imperfection might hereafter appear; and upon this"
"x121","conviction she need not fear to acknowledge some actual specks in"
"x121","the character of their father, who, though cleared from the grossly"
"x121","injurious suspicions which she must ever blush to have entertained, she"
"x121","did believe, upon serious consideration, to be not perfectly amiable."
"x121",""
"x121","Her mind made up on these several points, and her resolution formed, of"
"x121","always judging and acting in future with the greatest good sense, she"
"x121","had nothing to do but to forgive herself and be happier than ever; and"
"x121","the lenient hand of time did much for her by insensible gradations in"
"x121","the course of another day. Henry's astonishing generosity and nobleness"
"x121","of conduct, in never alluding in the slightest way to what had passed,"
"x121","was of the greatest assistance to her; and sooner than she could have"
"x121","supposed it possible in the beginning of her distress, her spirits"
"x121","became absolutely comfortable, and capable, as heretofore, of continual"
"x121","improvement by anything he said. There were still some subjects, indeed,"
"x121","under which she believed they must always tremble--the mention of a"
"x121","chest or a cabinet, for instance--and she did not love the sight of"
"x121","japan in any shape: but even she could allow that an occasional memento"
"x121","of past folly, however painful, might not be without use."
"x121",""
"x121","The anxieties of common life began soon to succeed to the alarms of"
"x121","romance. Her desire of hearing from Isabella grew every day greater."
"x121","She was quite impatient to know how the Bath world went on, and how the"
"x121","rooms were attended; and especially was she anxious to be assured of"
"x121","Isabella's having matched some fine netting-cotton, on which she had"
"x121","left her intent; and of her continuing on the best terms with James. Her"
"x121","only dependence for information of any kind was on Isabella. James had"
"x121","protested against writing to her till his return to Oxford; and Mrs."
"x121","Allen had given her no hopes of a letter till she had got back to"
"x121","Fullerton. But Isabella had promised and promised again; and when she"
"x121","promised a thing, she was so scrupulous in performing it! This made it"
"x121","so particularly strange!"
"x121",""
"x121","For nine successive mornings, Catherine wondered over the repetition"
"x121","of a disappointment, which each morning became more severe: but, on"
"x121","the tenth, when she entered the breakfast-room, her first object was a"
"x121","letter, held out by Henry's willing hand. She thanked him as heartily"
"x121","as if he had written it himself. ""'Tis only from James, however,"" as she"
"x121","looked at the direction. She opened it; it was from Oxford; and to this"
"x121","purpose:"
"x121",""
"x121",""
"x121","""Dear Catherine,"
"x121",""
"x121","""Though, God knows, with little inclination for writing, I think it my"
"x121","duty to tell you that everything is at an end between Miss Thorpe and"
"x121","me. I left her and Bath yesterday, never to see either again. I shall"
"x121","not enter into particulars--they would only pain you more. You will soon"
"x121","hear enough from another quarter to know where lies the blame; and I"
"x121","hope will acquit your brother of everything but the folly of too easily"
"x121","thinking his affection returned. Thank God! I am undeceived in time!"
"x121","But it is a heavy blow! After my father's consent had been so kindly"
"x121","given--but no more of this. She has made me miserable forever! Let me"
"x121","soon hear from you, dear Catherine; you are my only friend; your love"
"x121","I do build upon. I wish your visit at Northanger may be over before"
"x121","Captain Tilney makes his engagement known, or you will be uncomfortably"
"x121","circumstanced. Poor Thorpe is in town: I dread the sight of him; his"
"x121","honest heart would feel so much. I have written to him and my father."
"x121","Her duplicity hurts me more than all; till the very last, if I reasoned"
"x121","with her, she declared herself as much attached to me as ever, and"
"x121","laughed at my fears. I am ashamed to think how long I bore with it;"
"x121","but if ever man had reason to believe himself loved, I was that man. I"
"x121","cannot understand even now what she would be at, for there could be no"
"x121","need of my being played off to make her secure of Tilney. We parted"
"x121","at last by mutual consent--happy for me had we never met! I can never"
"x121","expect to know such another woman! Dearest Catherine, beware how you"
"x121","give your heart."

"x121",""
"x121","Catherine had not read three lines before her sudden change of"
"x121","countenance, and short exclamations of sorrowing wonder, declared her to"
"x121","be receiving unpleasant news; and Henry, earnestly watching her through"
"x121","the whole letter, saw plainly that it ended no better than it began. He"
"x121","was prevented, however, from even looking his surprise by his father's"
"x121","entrance. They went to breakfast directly; but Catherine could hardly"
"x121","eat anything. Tears filled her eyes, and even ran down her cheeks as she"
"x121","sat. The letter was one moment in her hand, then in her lap, and then in"
"x121","her pocket; and she looked as if she knew not what she did. The general,"
"x121","between his cocoa and his newspaper, had luckily no leisure for noticing"
"x121","her; but to the other two her distress was equally visible. As soon"
"x121","as she dared leave the table she hurried away to her own room; but the"
"x121","housemaids were busy in it, and she was obliged to come down again."
"x121","She turned into the drawing-room for privacy, but Henry and Eleanor had"
"x121","likewise retreated thither, and were at that moment deep in consultation"
"x121","about her. She drew back, trying to beg their pardon, but was, with"
"x121","gentle violence, forced to return; and the others withdrew, after"
"x121","Eleanor had affectionately expressed a wish of being of use or comfort"
"x121","to her."
"x121",""
"x121","After half an hour's free indulgence of grief and reflection, Catherine"
"x121","felt equal to encountering her friends; but whether she should make"
"x121","her distress known to them was another consideration. Perhaps, if"
"x121","particularly questioned, she might just give an idea--just distantly"
"x121","hint at it--but not more. To expose a friend, such a friend as Isabella"
"x121","had been to her--and then their own brother so closely concerned in it!"
"x121","She believed she must waive the subject altogether. Henry and Eleanor"
"x121","were by themselves in the breakfast-room; and each, as she entered it,"
"x121","looked at her anxiously. Catherine took her place at the table, and,"
"x121","after a short silence, Eleanor said, ""No bad news from Fullerton, I"

"x121",""
"x121",""
"x121","From this time, the subject was frequently canvassed by the three young"
"x121","people; and Catherine found, with some surprise, that her two young"
"x121","friends were perfectly agreed in considering Isabella's want of"
"x121","consequence and fortune as likely to throw great difficulties in the way"
"x121","of her marrying their brother. Their persuasion that the general would,"
"x121","upon this ground alone, independent of the objection that might be"
"x121","raised against her character, oppose the connection, turned her feelings"
"x121","moreover with some alarm towards herself. She was as insignificant,"
"x121","and perhaps as portionless, as Isabella; and if the heir of the Tilney"
"x121","property had not grandeur and wealth enough in himself, at what point"
"x121","of interest were the demands of his younger brother to rest? The very"
"x121","painful reflections to which this thought led could only be dispersed by"
"x121","a dependence on the effect of that particular partiality, which, as she"
"x121","was given to understand by his words as well as his actions, she had"
"x121","from the first been so fortunate as to excite in the general; and by a"
"x121","recollection of some most generous and disinterested sentiments on the"
"x121","subject of money, which she had more than once heard him utter, and"
"x121","which tempted her to think his disposition in such matters misunderstood"
"x121","by his children."
"x121",""
"x121","They were so fully convinced, however, that their brother would not"
"x121","have the courage to apply in person for his father's consent, and so"
"x121","repeatedly assured her that he had never in his life been less likely to"
"x121","come to Northanger than at the present time, that she suffered her mind"
"x121","to be at ease as to the necessity of any sudden removal of her own. But"
"x121","as it was not to be supposed that Captain Tilney, whenever he made his"
"x121","application, would give his father any just idea of Isabella's conduct,"
"x121","it occurred to her as highly expedient that Henry should lay the whole"
"x121","business before him as it really was, enabling the general by that means"
"x121","to form a cool and impartial opinion, and prepare his objections on"
"x121","a fairer ground than inequality of situations. She proposed it to him"
"x121","accordingly; but he did not catch at the measure so eagerly as she had"
"x121","expected. ""No,"" said he, ""my father's hands need not be strengthened,"
"x121","and Frederick's confession of folly need not be forestalled. He must"

"x121","brother and sister knew not what to think. Sometimes it appeared to"

"x121","engagement, and at others that it was wholly incompatible with it."
"x121","The general, meanwhile, though offended every morning by Frederick's"
"x121","remissness in writing, was free from any real anxiety about him, and had"
"x121","no more pressing solicitude than that of making Miss Morland's time at"
"x121","Northanger pass pleasantly. He often expressed his uneasiness on this"
"x121","head, feared the sameness of every day's society and employments would"
"x121","disgust her with the place, wished the Lady Frasers had been in the"
"x121","country, talked every now and then of having a large party to dinner,"
"x121","and once or twice began even to calculate the number of young dancing"
"x121","people in the neighbourhood. But then it was such a dead time of year,"
"x121","no wild-fowl, no game, and the Lady Frasers were not in the country."
"x121","And it all ended, at last, in his telling Henry one morning that when he"
"x121","next went to Woodston, they would take him by surprise there some day"
"x121","or other, and eat their mutton with him. Henry was greatly honoured and"
"x121","very happy, and Catherine was quite delighted with the scheme. ""And when"
"x121","do you think, sir, I may look forward to this pleasure? I must be at"

"x121","if I stayed away now; for, as I am known to be in the country, it would"
"x121","be taken exceedingly amiss; and it is a rule with me, Miss Morland,"
"x121","never to give offence to any of my neighbours, if a small sacrifice of"
"x121","time and attention can prevent it. They are a set of very worthy men."
"x121","They have half a buck from Northanger twice a year; and I dine with them"

"x121","any other house. The painful remembrance of the folly it had helped"
"x121","to nourish and perfect was the only emotion which could spring from a"
"x121","consideration of the building. What a revolution in her ideas! She, who"
"x121","had so longed to be in an abbey! Now, there was nothing so charming"
"x121","to her imagination as the unpretending comfort of a well-connected"

"x121","and looked with great admiration at every neat house above the rank of"
"x121","a cottage, and at all the little chandler's shops which they passed. At"
"x121","the further end of the village, and tolerably disengaged from the rest"

"x121","will know, from this description, I must mean Captain Tilney, who, as"
"x121","you may remember, was amazingly disposed to follow and tease me, before"
"x121","you went away. Afterwards he got worse, and became quite my shadow. Many"
"x121","girls might have been taken in, for never were such attentions; but I"
"x121","knew the fickle sex too well. He went away to his regiment two days ago,"
"x121","and I trust I shall never be plagued with him again. He is the greatest"
"x121","coxcomb I ever saw, and amazingly disagreeable. The last two days he was"
"x121","always by the side of Charlotte Davis: I pitied his taste, but took no"
"x121","notice of him. The last time we met was in Bath Street, and I turned"
"x121","directly into a shop that he might not speak to me; I would not even"
"x121","look at him. He went into the pump-room afterwards; but I would not have"
"x121","followed him for all the world. Such a contrast between him and your"
"x121","brother! Pray send me some news of the latter--I am quite unhappy about"
"x121","him; he seemed so uncomfortable when he went away, with a cold, or"
"x121","something that affected his spirits. I would write to him myself, but"
"x121","have mislaid his direction; and, as I hinted above, am afraid he"
"x121","took something in my conduct amiss. Pray explain everything to his"
"x121","satisfaction; or, if he still harbours any doubt, a line from himself"
"x121","to me, or a call at Putney when next in town, might set all to rights."
"x121","I have not been to the rooms this age, nor to the play, except going in"
"x121","last night with the Hodges, for a frolic, at half price: they teased"
"x121","me into it; and I was determined they should not say I shut myself up"
"x121","because Tilney was gone. We happened to sit by the Mitchells, and they"
"x121","pretended to be quite surprised to see me out. I knew their spite: at"
"x121","one time they could not be civil to me, but now they are all friendship;"
"x121","but I am not such a fool as to be taken in by them. You know I have a"
"x121","pretty good spirit of my own. Anne Mitchell had tried to put on a"
"x121","turban like mine, as I wore it the week before at the concert, but made"
"x121","wretched work of it--it happened to become my odd face, I believe, at"
"x121","least Tilney told me so at the time, and said every eye was upon me; but"
"x121","he is the last man whose word I would take. I wear nothing but purple"

"x121",""
"x121",""
"x121","Soon after this, the general found himself obliged to go to London for"
"x121","a week; and he left Northanger earnestly regretting that any necessity"
"x121","should rob him even for an hour of Miss Morland's company, and anxiously"
"x121","recommending the study of her comfort and amusement to his children"
"x121","as their chief object in his absence. His departure gave Catherine the"
"x121","first experimental conviction that a loss may be sometimes a gain. The"
"x121","happiness with which their time now passed, every employment voluntary,"
"x121","every laugh indulged, every meal a scene of ease and good humour,"
"x121","walking where they liked and when they liked, their hours, pleasures,"
"x121","and fatigues at their own command, made her thoroughly sensible of the"
"x121","restraint which the general's presence had imposed, and most thankfully"
"x121","feel their present release from it. Such ease and such delights made her"
"x121","love the place and the people more and more every day; and had it not"
"x121","been for a dread of its soon becoming expedient to leave the one, and"
"x121","an apprehension of not being equally beloved by the other, she would at"
"x121","each moment of each day have been perfectly happy; but she was now in"
"x121","the fourth week of her visit; before the general came home, the fourth"
"x121","week would be turned, and perhaps it might seem an intrusion if she"
"x121","stayed much longer. This was a painful consideration whenever it"
"x121","occurred; and eager to get rid of such a weight on her mind, she very"
"x121","soon resolved to speak to Eleanor about it at once, propose going away,"
"x121","and be guided in her conduct by the manner in which her proposal might"
"x121","be taken."
"x121",""
"x121","Aware that if she gave herself much time, she might feel it difficult to"
"x121","bring forward so unpleasant a subject, she took the first opportunity of"
"x121","being suddenly alone with Eleanor, and of Eleanor's being in the"
"x121","middle of a speech about something very different, to start forth her"
"x121","obligation of going away very soon. Eleanor looked and declared herself"
"x121","much concerned. She had ""hoped for the pleasure of her company for a"
"x121","much longer time--had been misled (perhaps by her wishes) to suppose"
"x121","that a much longer visit had been promised--and could not but think that"
"x121","if Mr. and Mrs. Morland were aware of the pleasure it was to her to have"
"x121","her there, they would be too generous to hasten her return."" Catherine"
"x121","explained: ""Oh! As to that, Papa and Mamma were in no hurry at all. As"
"x121","long as she was happy, they would always be satisfied."""
"x121",""
"x121","""Then why, might she ask, in such a hurry herself to leave them?"""
"x121",""
"x121","""Oh! Because she had been there so long."""
"x121",""
"x121","""Nay, if you can use such a word, I can urge you no farther. If you"
"x121","think it long--"""
"x121",""
"x121","""Oh! No, I do not indeed. For my own pleasure, I could stay with you as"
"x121","long again."" And it was directly settled that, till she had, her leaving"
"x121","them was not even to be thought of. In having this cause of uneasiness"
"x121","so pleasantly removed, the force of the other was likewise weakened. The"
"x121","kindness, the earnestness of Eleanor's manner in pressing her to stay,"
"x121","and Henry's gratified look on being told that her stay was determined,"
"x121","were such sweet proofs of her importance with them, as left her only"
"x121","just so much solicitude as the human mind can never do comfortably"
"x121","without. She did--almost always--believe that Henry loved her, and quite"
"x121","always that his father and sister loved and even wished her to belong"
"x121","to them; and believing so far, her doubts and anxieties were merely"
"x121","sportive irritations."
"x121",""
"x121","Henry was not able to obey his father's injunction of remaining wholly"
"x121","at Northanger in attendance on the ladies, during his absence in London,"
"x121","the engagements of his curate at Woodston obliging him to leave them on"
"x121","Saturday for a couple of nights. His loss was not now what it had been"
"x121","while the general was at home; it lessened their gaiety, but did not"
"x121","ruin their comfort; and the two girls agreeing in occupation, and"
"x121","improving in intimacy, found themselves so well sufficient for the time"
"x121","to themselves, that it was eleven o'clock, rather a late hour at"
"x121","the abbey, before they quitted the supper-room on the day of Henry's"
"x121","departure. They had just reached the head of the stairs when it seemed,"
"x121","as far as the thickness of the walls would allow them to judge, that a"
"x121","carriage was driving up to the door, and the next moment confirmed the"
"x121","idea by the loud noise of the house-bell. After the first perturbation"
"x121","of surprise had passed away, in a ""Good heaven! What can be the matter?"""
"x121","it was quickly decided by Eleanor to be her eldest brother, whose"
"x121","arrival was often as sudden, if not quite so unseasonable, and"
"x121","accordingly she hurried down to welcome him."
"x121",""
"x121","Catherine walked on to her chamber, making up her mind as well as she"
"x121","could, to a further acquaintance with Captain Tilney, and comforting"
"x121","herself under the unpleasant impression his conduct had given her, and"
"x121","the persuasion of his being by far too fine a gentleman to approve of"
"x121","her, that at least they should not meet under such circumstances as"
"x121","would make their meeting materially painful. She trusted he would never"
"x121","speak of Miss Thorpe; and indeed, as he must by this time be ashamed of"
"x121","the part he had acted, there could be no danger of it; and as long as"
"x121","all mention of Bath scenes were avoided, she thought she could behave"
"x121","to him very civilly. In such considerations time passed away, and it was"
"x121","certainly in his favour that Eleanor should be so glad to see him, and"
"x121","have so much to say, for half an hour was almost gone since his arrival,"
"x121","and Eleanor did not come up."
"x121",""
"x121","At that moment Catherine thought she heard her step in the gallery, and"
"x121","listened for its continuance; but all was silent. Scarcely, however,"
"x121","had she convicted her fancy of error, when the noise of something moving"
"x121","close to her door made her start; it seemed as if someone was touching"
"x121","the very doorway--and in another moment a slight motion of the lock"
"x121","proved that some hand must be on it. She trembled a little at the idea"
"x121","of anyone's approaching so cautiously; but resolving not to be again"
"x121","overcome by trivial appearances of alarm, or misled by a raised"
"x121","imagination, she stepped quietly forward, and opened the door. Eleanor,"
"x121","and only Eleanor, stood there. Catherine's spirits, however, were"
"x121","tranquillized but for an instant, for Eleanor's cheeks were pale, and"
"x121","her manner greatly agitated. Though evidently intending to come in, it"
"x121","seemed an effort to enter the room, and a still greater to speak when"
"x121","there. Catherine, supposing some uneasiness on Captain Tilney's account,"
"x121","could only express her concern by silent attention, obliged her to be"
"x121","seated, rubbed her temples with lavender-water, and hung over her with"
"x121","affectionate solicitude. ""My dear Catherine, you must not--you must not"
"x121","indeed--"" were Eleanor's first connected words. ""I am quite well."
"x121","This kindness distracts me--I cannot bear it--I come to you on such an"
"x121","errand!"""
"x121",""
"x121","""Errand! To me!"""
"x121",""
"x121","""How shall I tell you! Oh! How shall I tell you!"""

"x121","A new idea now darted into Catherine's mind, and turning as pale as her"
"x121","friend, she exclaimed, ""'Tis a messenger from Woodston!"""

"x121","""You are mistaken, indeed,"" returned Eleanor, looking at her most"
"x121","compassionately; ""it is no one from Woodston. It is my father himself."""
"x121","Her voice faltered, and her eyes were turned to the ground as she"
"x121","mentioned his name. His unlooked-for return was enough in itself to make"
"x121","Catherine's heart sink, and for a few moments she hardly supposed"
"x121","there were anything worse to be told. She said nothing; and Eleanor,"
"x121","endeavouring to collect herself and speak with firmness, but with eyes"
"x121","still cast down, soon went on. ""You are too good, I am sure, to think"
"x121","the worse of me for the part I am obliged to perform. I am indeed a most"
"x121","unwilling messenger. After what has so lately passed, so lately been"
"x121","settled between us--how joyfully, how thankfully on my side!--as to your"
"x121","continuing here as I hoped for many, many weeks longer, how can I tell"
"x121","you that your kindness is not to be accepted--and that the happiness"
"x121","your company has hitherto given us is to be repaid by--But I must not"

"x121","has recollected an engagement that takes our whole family away on"
"x121","Monday. We are going to Lord Longtown's, near Hereford, for a fortnight."

"x121","either."""

"x121","""My dear Eleanor,"" cried Catherine, suppressing her feelings as well as"
"x121","she could, ""do not be so distressed. A second engagement must give"
"x121","way to a first. I am very, very sorry we are to part--so soon, and so"
"x121","suddenly too; but I am not offended, indeed I am not. I can finish my"

"x121","take leave, however. I need not go till just before you do, you know. Do"
"x121","not be distressed, Eleanor, I can go on Monday very well. My father"
"x121","and mother's having no notice of it is of very little consequence. The"

"x121","Catherine's swelling heart needed relief. In Eleanor's presence"

"x121","could atone for the abruptness, the rudeness, nay, the insolence of"
"x121","it. Henry at a distance--not able even to bid him farewell. Every hope,"
"x121","every expectation from him suspended, at least, and who could say how"
"x121","long? Who could say when they might meet again? And all this by such"
"x121","a man as General Tilney, so polite, so well bred, and heretofore"
"x121","so particularly fond of her! It was as incomprehensible as it was"
"x121","mortifying and grievous. From what it could arise, and where it would"
"x121","end, were considerations of equal perplexity and alarm. The manner in"
"x121","which it was done so grossly uncivil, hurrying her away without any"
"x121","reference to her own convenience, or allowing her even the appearance"
"x121","of choice as to the time or mode of her travelling; of two days, the"
"x121","earliest fixed on, and of that almost the earliest hour, as if resolved"
"x121","to have her gone before he was stirring in the morning, that he"
"x121","might not be obliged even to see her. What could all this mean but"
"x121","an intentional affront? By some means or other she must have had the"
"x121","misfortune to offend him. Eleanor had wished to spare her from so"
"x121","painful a notion, but Catherine could not believe it possible that any"
"x121","injury or any misfortune could provoke such ill will against a person"
"x121","not connected, or, at least, not supposed to be connected with it."

"x121","Heavily passed the night. Sleep, or repose that deserved the name"
"x121","of sleep, was out of the question. That room, in which her disturbed"

"x121","of agitated spirits and unquiet slumbers. Yet how different now the"
"x121","source of her inquietude from what it had been then--how mournfully"
"x121","superior in reality and substance! Her anxiety had foundation in"
"x121","fact, her fears in probability; and with a mind so occupied in the"
"x121","contemplation of actual and natural evil, the solitude of her situation,"
"x121","the darkness of her chamber, the antiquity of the building, were felt"
"x121","and considered without the smallest emotion; and though the wind was"
"x121","high, and often produced strange and sudden noises throughout the house,"
"x121","she heard it all as she lay awake, hour after hour, without curiosity or"
"x121","terror."

"x121","Soon after six Eleanor entered her room, eager to show attention or give"
"x121","assistance where it was possible; but very little remained to be done."
"x121","Catherine had not loitered; she was almost dressed, and her packing"
"x121","almost finished. The possibility of some conciliatory message from the"
"x121","general occurred to her as his daughter appeared. What so natural, as"
"x121","that anger should pass away and repentance succeed it? And she only"
"x121","wanted to know how far, after what had passed, an apology might properly"
"x121","be received by her. But the knowledge would have been useless here;"
"x121","it was not called for; neither clemency nor dignity was put to the"
"x121","trial--Eleanor brought no message. Very little passed between them on"
"x121","meeting; each found her greatest safety in silence, and few and trivial"
"x121","were the sentences exchanged while they remained upstairs, Catherine in"
"x121","busy agitation completing her dress, and Eleanor with more goodwill than"
"x121","experience intent upon filling the trunk. When everything was done they"
"x121","left the room, Catherine lingering only half a minute behind her friend"
"x121","to throw a parting glance on every well-known, cherished object, and"
"x121","went down to the breakfast-parlour, where breakfast was prepared. She"
"x121","tried to eat, as well to save herself from the pain of being urged as"
"x121","to make her friend comfortable; but she had no appetite, and could not"
"x121","swallow many mouthfuls. The contrast between this and her last breakfast"
"x121","in that room gave her fresh misery, and strengthened her distaste for"
"x121","everything before her. It was not four and twenty hours ago since they"
"x121","had met there to the same repast, but in circumstances how different!"
"x121","With what cheerful ease, what happy, though false, security, had she"
"x121","then looked around her, enjoying everything present, and fearing little"
"x121","in future, beyond Henry's going to Woodston for a day! Happy, happy"
"x121","breakfast! For Henry had been there; Henry had sat by her and helped"
"x121","her. These reflections were long indulged undisturbed by any address"
"x121","from her companion, who sat as deep in thought as herself; and the"
"x121","appearance of the carriage was the first thing to startle and recall"
"x121","them to the present moment. Catherine's colour rose at the sight of it;"
"x121","and the indignity with which she was treated, striking at that instant"
"x121","on her mind with peculiar force, made her for a short time sensible only"
"x121","of resentment. Eleanor seemed now impelled into resolution and speech."
"x121",""
"x121","""You must write to me, Catherine,"" she cried; ""you must let me hear from"
"x121","you as soon as possible. Till I know you to be safe at home, I shall"
"x121","not have an hour's comfort. For one letter, at all risks, all hazards, I"
"x121","must entreat. Let me have the satisfaction of knowing that you are safe"
"x121","at Fullerton, and have found your family well, and then, till I can ask"
"x121","for your correspondence as I ought to do, I will not expect more. Direct"
"x121","to me at Lord Longtown's, and, I must ask it, under cover to Alice."""
"x121",""
"x121","""No, Eleanor, if you are not allowed to receive a letter from me, I am"
"x121","sure I had better not write. There can be no doubt of my getting home"
"x121","safe."""
"x121",""
"x121","Eleanor only replied, ""I cannot wonder at your feelings. I will not"
"x121","importune you. I will trust to your own kindness of heart when I am at"
"x121","a distance from you."" But this, with the look of sorrow accompanying"
"x121","it, was enough to melt Catherine's pride in a moment, and she instantly"
"x121","said, ""Oh, Eleanor, I will write to you indeed."""
"x121",""
"x121","There was yet another point which Miss Tilney was anxious to settle,"
"x121","though somewhat embarrassed in speaking of. It had occurred to her that"
"x121","after so long an absence from home, Catherine might not be provided with"
"x121","money enough for the expenses of her journey, and, upon suggesting it"
"x121","to her with most affectionate offers of accommodation, it proved to be"
"x121","exactly the case. Catherine had never thought on the subject till that"
"x121","moment, but, upon examining her purse, was convinced that but for"
"x121","this kindness of her friend, she might have been turned from the house"
"x121","without even the means of getting home; and the distress in which she"
"x121","must have been thereby involved filling the minds of both, scarcely"
"x121","another word was said by either during the time of their remaining"
"x121","together. Short, however, was that time. The carriage was soon announced"
"x121","to be ready; and Catherine, instantly rising, a long and affectionate"
"x121","embrace supplied the place of language in bidding each other adieu; and,"
"x121","as they entered the hall, unable to leave the house without some mention"
"x121","of one whose name had not yet been spoken by either, she paused a"
"x121","moment, and with quivering lips just made it intelligible that she left"
"x121","""her kind remembrance for her absent friend."" But with this approach to"
"x121","his name ended all possibility of restraining her feelings; and, hiding"
"x121","her face as well as she could with her handkerchief, she darted across"
"x121","the hall, jumped into the chaise, and in a moment was driven from the"
"x121","door."

"x121",""
"x121",""
"x121","Catherine was too wretched to be fearful. The journey in itself had no"
"x121","terrors for her; and she began it without either dreading its length or"
"x121","feeling its solitariness. Leaning back in one corner of the carriage, in"
"x121","a violent burst of tears, she was conveyed some miles beyond the walls"
"x121","of the abbey before she raised her head; and the highest point of ground"
"x121","within the park was almost closed from her view before she was capable"
"x121","of turning her eyes towards it. Unfortunately, the road she now"
"x121","travelled was the same which only ten days ago she had so happily passed"
"x121","along in going to and from Woodston; and, for fourteen miles, every"
"x121","bitter feeling was rendered more severe by the review of objects on"
"x121","which she had first looked under impressions so different. Every mile,"
"x121","as it brought her nearer Woodston, added to her sufferings, and when"
"x121","within the distance of five, she passed the turning which led to it, and"
"x121","thought of Henry, so near, yet so unconscious, her grief and agitation"
"x121","were excessive."
"x121",""
"x121","The day which she had spent at that place had been one of the happiest"
"x121","of her life. It was there, it was on that day, that the general had made"
"x121","use of such expressions with regard to Henry and herself, had so"
"x121","spoken and so looked as to give her the most positive conviction of his"
"x121","actually wishing their marriage. Yes, only ten days ago had he"
"x121","elated her by his pointed regard--had he even confused her by his too"
"x121","significant reference! And now--what had she done, or what had she"
"x121","omitted to do, to merit such a change?"
"x121",""
"x121","The only offence against him of which she could accuse herself had been"
"x121","such as was scarcely possible to reach his knowledge. Henry and her own"
"x121","heart only were privy to the shocking suspicions which she had so idly"
"x121","entertained; and equally safe did she believe her secret with each."
"x121","Designedly, at least, Henry could not have betrayed her. If, indeed, by"
"x121","any strange mischance his father should have gained intelligence of"
"x121","what she had dared to think and look for, of her causeless fancies"
"x121","and injurious examinations, she could not wonder at any degree of his"
"x121","indignation. If aware of her having viewed him as a murderer, she could"
"x121","not wonder at his even turning her from his house. But a justification"
"x121","so full of torture to herself, she trusted, would not be in his power."
"x121",""
"x121","Anxious as were all her conjectures on this point, it was not, however,"
"x121","the one on which she dwelt most. There was a thought yet nearer, a more"
"x121","prevailing, more impetuous concern. How Henry would think, and feel,"
"x121","and look, when he returned on the morrow to Northanger and heard of"
"x121","her being gone, was a question of force and interest to rise over every"
"x121","other, to be never ceasing, alternately irritating and soothing; it"
"x121","sometimes suggested the dread of his calm acquiescence, and at others"
"x121","was answered by the sweetest confidence in his regret and resentment. To"
"x121","the general, of course, he would not dare to speak; but to Eleanor--what"
"x121","might he not say to Eleanor about her?"
"x121",""
"x121","In this unceasing recurrence of doubts and inquiries, on any one article"
"x121","of which her mind was incapable of more than momentary repose, the hours"
"x121","passed away, and her journey advanced much faster than she looked for."
"x121","The pressing anxieties of thought, which prevented her from noticing"
"x121","anything before her, when once beyond the neighbourhood of Woodston,"
"x121","saved her at the same time from watching her progress; and though no"
"x121","object on the road could engage a moment's attention, she found no stage"
"x121","of it tedious. From this, she was preserved too by another cause, by"
"x121","feeling no eagerness for her journey's conclusion; for to return in such"
"x121","a manner to Fullerton was almost to destroy the pleasure of a meeting"
"x121","with those she loved best, even after an absence such as hers--an eleven"
"x121","weeks' absence. What had she to say that would not humble herself and"
"x121","pain her family, that would not increase her own grief by the confession"
"x121","of it, extend an useless resentment, and perhaps involve the innocent"
"x121","with the guilty in undistinguishing ill will? She could never do justice"
"x121","to Henry and Eleanor's merit; she felt it too strongly for expression;"
"x121","and should a dislike be taken against them, should they be thought of"
"x121","unfavourably, on their father's account, it would cut her to the heart."
"x121",""
"x121","With these feelings, she rather dreaded than sought for the first view"
"x121","of that well-known spire which would announce her within twenty miles of"
"x121","home. Salisbury she had known to be her point on leaving Northanger; but"
"x121","after the first stage she had been indebted to the post-masters for the"
"x121","names of the places which were then to conduct her to it; so great"
"x121","had been her ignorance of her route. She met with nothing, however,"
"x121","to distress or frighten her. Her youth, civil manners, and liberal"
"x121","pay procured her all the attention that a traveller like herself could"
"x121","require; and stopping only to change horses, she travelled on for"
"x121","about eleven hours without accident or alarm, and between six and seven"
"x121","o'clock in the evening found herself entering Fullerton."
"x121",""
"x121","A heroine returning, at the close of her career, to her native village,"
"x121","in all the triumph of recovered reputation, and all the dignity of"
"x121","a countess, with a long train of noble relations in their several"
"x121","phaetons, and three waiting-maids in a travelling chaise and four,"
"x121","behind her, is an event on which the pen of the contriver may well"
"x121","delight to dwell; it gives credit to every conclusion, and the author"
"x121","must share in the glory she so liberally bestows. But my affair is"
"x121","widely different; I bring back my heroine to her home in solitude and"
"x121","disgrace; and no sweet elation of spirits can lead me into minuteness."
"x121","A heroine in a hack post-chaise is such a blow upon sentiment, as no"

"x121","speedy shall be her descent from it."

"x121","But, whatever might be the distress of Catherine's mind, as she thus"
"x121","advanced towards the parsonage, and whatever the humiliation of her"
"x121","biographer in relating it, she was preparing enjoyment of no everyday"
"x121","nature for those to whom she went; first, in the appearance of her"
"x121","carriage--and secondly, in herself. The chaise of a traveller being"
"x121","a rare sight in Fullerton, the whole family were immediately at the"

"x121","every eye and occupy every fancy--a pleasure quite unlooked for by all"
"x121","but the two youngest children, a boy and girl of six and four years old,"
"x121","who expected a brother or sister in every carriage. Happy the glance"
"x121","that first distinguished Catherine! Happy the voice that proclaimed the"
"x121","discovery! But whether such happiness were the lawful property of George"
"x121","or Harriet could never be exactly understood."
"x121",""
"x121","Her father, mother, Sarah, George, and Harriet, all assembled at the"
"x121","door to welcome her with affectionate eagerness, was a sight to awaken"

"x121","she stepped from the carriage, she found herself soothed beyond anything"
"x121","that she had believed possible. So surrounded, so caressed, she was even"
"x121","happy! In the joyfulness of family love everything for a short time was"
"x121","subdued, and the pleasure of seeing her, leaving them at first little"
"x121","leisure for calm curiosity, they were all seated round the tea-table,"
"x121","which Mrs. Morland had hurried for the comfort of the poor traveller,"
"x121","whose pale and jaded looks soon caught her notice, before any inquiry so"
"x121","direct as to demand a positive answer was addressed to her."

"x121","Reluctantly, and with much hesitation, did she then begin what might"
"x121","perhaps, at the end of half an hour, be termed, by the courtesy of her"

"x121","at all discover the cause, or collect the particulars, of her sudden"
"x121","return. They were far from being an irritable race; far from any"
"x121","quickness in catching, or bitterness in resenting, affronts: but here,"
"x121","when the whole was unfolded, was an insult not to be overlooked, nor,"
"x121","for the first half hour, to be easily pardoned. Without suffering any"
"x121","romantic alarm, in the consideration of their daughter's long and lonely"
"x121","journey, Mr. and Mrs. Morland could not but feel that it might have been"
"x121","productive of much unpleasantness to her; that it was what they could"
"x121","never have voluntarily suffered; and that, in forcing her on such"
"x121","a measure, General Tilney had acted neither honourably nor"
"x121","feelingly--neither as a gentleman nor as a parent. Why he had done it,"
"x121","what could have provoked him to such a breach of hospitality, and so"
"x121","suddenly turned all his partial regard for their daughter into actual"
"x121","ill will, was a matter which they were at least as far from divining"
"x121","as Catherine herself; but it did not oppress them by any means so long;"
"x121","and, after a due course of useless conjecture, that ""it was a strange"
"x121","business, and that he must be a very strange man,"" grew enough for all"
"x121","their indignation and wonder; though Sarah indeed still indulged in the"
"x121","sweets of incomprehensibility, exclaiming and conjecturing with youthful"

"x121","Catherine hoped so too, and tried to feel an interest in her own"

"x121","next counsel of going early to bed. Her parents, seeing nothing in"

"x121","parents of a young lady of seventeen, just returned from her first"

"x121","could determine on with any confidence of safety. The money therefore"

"x121","in the parlour. Her loss of spirits was a yet greater alteration. In her"
"x121","rambling and her idleness she might only be a caricature of herself; but"
"x121","in her silence and sadness she was the very reverse of all that she had"
"x121","been before."
"x121",""
"x121","For two days Mrs. Morland allowed it to pass even without a hint;"
"x121","but when a third night's rest had neither restored her cheerfulness,"
"x121","improved her in useful activity, nor given her a greater inclination for"
"x121","needlework, she could no longer refrain from the gentle reproof of, ""My"
"x121","dear Catherine, I am afraid you are growing quite a fine lady. I do not"
"x121","know when poor Richard's cravats would be done, if he had no friend"
"x121","but you. Your head runs too much upon Bath; but there is a time for"
"x121","everything--a time for balls and plays, and a time for work. You have"
"x121","had a long run of amusement, and now you must try to be useful."""
"x121",""
"x121","Catherine took up her work directly, saying, in a dejected voice, that"
"x121","""her head did not run upon Bath--much."""
"x121",""
"x121","""Then you are fretting about General Tilney, and that is very simple"
"x121","of you; for ten to one whether you ever see him again. You should never"
"x121","fret about trifles."" After a short silence--""I hope, my Catherine, you"
"x121","are not getting out of humour with home because it is not so grand"
"x121","as Northanger. That would be turning your visit into an evil indeed."
"x121","Wherever you are you should always be contented, but especially at home,"
"x121","because there you must spend the most of your time. I did not quite"
"x121","like, at breakfast, to hear you talk so much about the French bread at"
"x121","Northanger."""
"x121",""
"x121","""I am sure I do not care about the bread. It is all the same to me what"
"x121","I eat."""
"x121",""
"x121","""There is a very clever essay in one of the books upstairs upon much"
"x121","such a subject, about young girls that have been spoilt for home by"
"x121","great acquaintance--The Mirror, I think. I will look it out for you some"
"x121","day or other, because I am sure it will do you good."""
"x121",""
"x121","Catherine said no more, and, with an endeavour to do right, applied"
"x121","to her work; but, after a few minutes, sunk again, without knowing it"
"x121","herself, into languor and listlessness, moving herself in her chair,"
"x121","from the irritation of weariness, much oftener than she moved her"
"x121","needle. Mrs. Morland watched the progress of this relapse; and seeing,"
"x121","in her daughter's absent and dissatisfied look, the full proof of that"
"x121","repining spirit to which she had now begun to attribute her want of"
"x121","cheerfulness, hastily left the room to fetch the book in question,"
"x121","anxious to lose no time in attacking so dreadful a malady. It was some"
"x121","time before she could find what she looked for; and other family matters"
"x121","occurring to detain her, a quarter of an hour had elapsed ere she"
"x121","returned downstairs with the volume from which so much was hoped. Her"
"x121","avocations above having shut out all noise but what she created herself,"
"x121","she knew not that a visitor had arrived within the last few minutes,"
"x121","till, on entering the room, the first object she beheld was a young"
"x121","man whom she had never seen before. With a look of much respect, he"
"x121","immediately rose, and being introduced to her by her conscious daughter"
"x121","as ""Mr. Henry Tilney,"" with the embarrassment of real sensibility began"
"x121","to apologize for his appearance there, acknowledging that after what had"
"x121","passed he had little right to expect a welcome at Fullerton, and stating"
"x121","his impatience to be assured of Miss Morland's having reached her home"
"x121","in safety, as the cause of his intrusion. He did not address himself to"
"x121","an uncandid judge or a resentful heart. Far from comprehending him or"
"x121","his sister in their father's misconduct, Mrs. Morland had been always"
"x121","kindly disposed towards each, and instantly, pleased by his appearance,"
"x121","received him with the simple professions of unaffected benevolence;"
"x121","thanking him for such an attention to her daughter, assuring him that"
"x121","the friends of her children were always welcome there, and entreating"
"x121","him to say not another word of the past."
"x121",""
"x121","He was not ill-inclined to obey this request, for, though his heart was"
"x121","greatly relieved by such unlooked-for mildness, it was not just at that"
"x121","moment in his power to say anything to the purpose. Returning in silence"
"x121","to his seat, therefore, he remained for some minutes most civilly"
"x121","answering all Mrs. Morland's common remarks about the weather and"
"x121","roads. Catherine meanwhile--the anxious, agitated, happy, feverish"
"x121","Catherine--said not a word; but her glowing cheek and brightened eye"
"x121","made her mother trust that this good-natured visit would at least set"
"x121","her heart at ease for a time, and gladly therefore did she lay aside the"
"x121","first volume of The Mirror for a future hour."
"x121",""
"x121","Desirous of Mr. Morland's assistance, as well in giving encouragement,"
"x121","as in finding conversation for her guest, whose embarrassment on his"
"x121","father's account she earnestly pitied, Mrs. Morland had very early"
"x121","dispatched one of the children to summon him; but Mr. Morland was from"
"x121","home--and being thus without any support, at the end of a quarter of"
"x121","an hour she had nothing to say. After a couple of minutes' unbroken"
"x121","silence, Henry, turning to Catherine for the first time since her"
"x121","mother's entrance, asked her, with sudden alacrity, if Mr. and Mrs."
"x121","Allen were now at Fullerton? And on developing, from amidst all her"
"x121","perplexity of words in reply, the meaning, which one short syllable"
"x121","would have given, immediately expressed his intention of paying his"
"x121","respects to them, and, with a rising colour, asked her if she would"
"x121","have the goodness to show him the way. ""You may see the house from this"
"x121","window, sir,"" was information on Sarah's side, which produced only a"
"x121","bow of acknowledgment from the gentleman, and a silencing nod from"
"x121","her mother; for Mrs. Morland, thinking it probable, as a secondary"
"x121","consideration in his wish of waiting on their worthy neighbours, that he"
"x121","might have some explanation to give of his father's behaviour, which it"
"x121","must be more pleasant for him to communicate only to Catherine, would"
"x121","not on any account prevent her accompanying him. They began their walk,"
"x121","and Mrs. Morland was not entirely mistaken in his object in wishing it."
"x121","Some explanation on his father's account he had to give; but his first"
"x121","purpose was to explain himself, and before they reached Mr. Allen's"
"x121","grounds he had done it so well that Catherine did not think it could"
"x121","ever be repeated too often. She was assured of his affection; and that"
"x121","heart in return was solicited, which, perhaps, they pretty equally"
"x121","knew was already entirely his own; for, though Henry was now sincerely"
"x121","attached to her, though he felt and delighted in all the excellencies"
"x121","of her character and truly loved her society, I must confess that his"
"x121","affection originated in nothing better than gratitude, or, in other"
"x121","words, that a persuasion of her partiality for him had been the only"
"x121","cause of giving her a serious thought. It is a new circumstance in"
"x121","romance, I acknowledge, and dreadfully derogatory of an heroine's"
"x121","dignity; but if it be as new in common life, the credit of a wild"
"x121","imagination will at least be all my own."
"x121",""
"x121","A very short visit to Mrs. Allen, in which Henry talked at random,"
"x121","without sense or connection, and Catherine, rapt in the contemplation of"
"x121","her own unutterable happiness, scarcely opened her lips, dismissed them"
"x121","to the ecstasies of another tete-a-tete; and before it was suffered to"
"x121","close, she was enabled to judge how far he was sanctioned by parental"
"x121","authority in his present application. On his return from Woodston, two"
"x121","days before, he had been met near the abbey by his impatient father,"
"x121","hastily informed in angry terms of Miss Morland's departure, and ordered"
"x121","to think of her no more."
"x121",""
"x121","Such was the permission upon which he had now offered her his hand."
"x121","The affrighted Catherine, amidst all the terrors of expectation, as she"
"x121","listened to this account, could not but rejoice in the kind caution"
"x121","with which Henry had saved her from the necessity of a conscientious"
"x121","rejection, by engaging her faith before he mentioned the subject; and"
"x121","as he proceeded to give the particulars, and explain the motives of"
"x121","his father's conduct, her feelings soon hardened into even a triumphant"
"x121","delight. The general had had nothing to accuse her of, nothing to lay"
"x121","to her charge, but her being the involuntary, unconscious object of a"
"x121","deception which his pride could not pardon, and which a better pride"
"x121","would have been ashamed to own. She was guilty only of being less rich"
"x121","than he had supposed her to be. Under a mistaken persuasion of her"
"x121","possessions and claims, he had courted her acquaintance in Bath,"
"x121","solicited her company at Northanger, and designed her for his"
"x121","daughter-in-law. On discovering his error, to turn her from the house"
"x121","seemed the best, though to his feelings an inadequate proof of his"
"x121","resentment towards herself, and his contempt of her family."
"x121",""
"x121","John Thorpe had first misled him. The general, perceiving his son"
"x121","one night at the theatre to be paying considerable attention to Miss"
"x121","Morland, had accidentally inquired of Thorpe if he knew more of her"
"x121","than her name. Thorpe, most happy to be on speaking terms with a man"
"x121","of General Tilney's importance, had been joyfully and proudly"
"x121","communicative; and being at that time not only in daily expectation"
"x121","of Morland's engaging Isabella, but likewise pretty well resolved upon"
"x121","marrying Catherine himself, his vanity induced him to represent the"
"x121","family as yet more wealthy than his vanity and avarice had made him"
"x121","believe them. With whomsoever he was, or was likely to be connected, his"
"x121","own consequence always required that theirs should be great, and as his"
"x121","intimacy with any acquaintance grew, so regularly grew their fortune."
"x121","The expectations of his friend Morland, therefore, from the first"
"x121","overrated, had ever since his introduction to Isabella been gradually"
"x121","increasing; and by merely adding twice as much for the grandeur of the"
"x121","moment, by doubling what he chose to think the amount of Mr. Morland's"
"x121","preferment, trebling his private fortune, bestowing a rich aunt, and"
"x121","sinking half the children, he was able to represent the whole family"
"x121","to the general in a most respectable light. For Catherine, however, the"
"x121","peculiar object of the general's curiosity, and his own speculations,"
"x121","he had yet something more in reserve, and the ten or fifteen thousand"
"x121","pounds which her father could give her would be a pretty addition to Mr."
"x121","Allen's estate. Her intimacy there had made him seriously determine on"
"x121","her being handsomely legacied hereafter; and to speak of her therefore"
"x121","as the almost acknowledged future heiress of Fullerton naturally"
"x121","followed. Upon such intelligence the general had proceeded; for never"
"x121","had it occurred to him to doubt its authority. Thorpe's interest in the"
"x121","family, by his sister's approaching connection with one of its members,"
"x121","and his own views on another (circumstances of which he boasted with"
"x121","almost equal openness), seemed sufficient vouchers for his truth; and"
"x121","to these were added the absolute facts of the Allens being wealthy and"
"x121","childless, of Miss Morland's being under their care, and--as soon as his"
"x121","acquaintance allowed him to judge--of their treating her with parental"
"x121","kindness. His resolution was soon formed. Already had he discerned a"
"x121","liking towards Miss Morland in the countenance of his son; and thankful"
"x121","for Mr. Thorpe's communication, he almost instantly determined to spare"
"x121","no pains in weakening his boasted interest and ruining his dearest"
"x121","hopes. Catherine herself could not be more ignorant at the time of all"
"x121","this, than his own children. Henry and Eleanor, perceiving nothing in"
"x121","her situation likely to engage their father's particular respect, had"
"x121","seen with astonishment the suddenness, continuance, and extent of his"
"x121","attention; and though latterly, from some hints which had accompanied an"
"x121","almost positive command to his son of doing everything in his power to"
"x121","attach her, Henry was convinced of his father's believing it to be"
"x121","an advantageous connection, it was not till the late explanation at"
"x121","Northanger that they had the smallest idea of the false calculations"
"x121","which had hurried him on. That they were false, the general had learnt"
"x121","from the very person who had suggested them, from Thorpe himself, whom"
"x121","he had chanced to meet again in town, and who, under the influence of"
"x121","exactly opposite feelings, irritated by Catherine's refusal, and"
"x121","yet more by the failure of a very recent endeavour to accomplish a"
"x121","reconciliation between Morland and Isabella, convinced that they were"
"x121","separated forever, and spurning a friendship which could be no longer"
"x121","serviceable, hastened to contradict all that he had said before to"
"x121","the advantage of the Morlands--confessed himself to have been totally"
"x121","mistaken in his opinion of their circumstances and character, misled by"
"x121","the rhodomontade of his friend to believe his father a man of substance"
"x121","and credit, whereas the transactions of the two or three last weeks"
"x121","proved him to be neither; for after coming eagerly forward on the first"
"x121","overture of a marriage between the families, with the most liberal"
"x121","proposals, he had, on being brought to the point by the shrewdness of"
"x121","the relator, been constrained to acknowledge himself incapable of"
"x121","giving the young people even a decent support. They were, in fact, a"
"x121","necessitous family; numerous, too, almost beyond example; by no means"
"x121","respected in their own neighbourhood, as he had lately had particular"
"x121","opportunities of discovering; aiming at a style of life which their"
"x121","fortune could not warrant; seeking to better themselves by wealthy"
"x121","connections; a forward, bragging, scheming race."
"x121",""
"x121","The terrified general pronounced the name of Allen with an inquiring"
"x121","look; and here too Thorpe had learnt his error. The Allens, he believed,"
"x121","had lived near them too long, and he knew the young man on whom the"
"x121","Fullerton estate must devolve. The general needed no more. Enraged with"
"x121","almost everybody in the world but himself, he set out the next day for"
"x121","the abbey, where his performances have been seen."
"x121",""
"x121","I leave it to my reader's sagacity to determine how much of all this"
"x121","it was possible for Henry to communicate at this time to Catherine, how"
"x121","much of it he could have learnt from his father, in what points his own"
"x121","conjectures might assist him, and what portion must yet remain to be"
"x121","told in a letter from James. I have united for their ease what they must"
"x121","divide for mine. Catherine, at any rate, heard enough to feel that in"
"x121","suspecting General Tilney of either murdering or shutting up his wife,"
"x121","she had scarcely sinned against his character, or magnified his cruelty."
"x121",""
"x121","Henry, in having such things to relate of his father, was almost"
"x121","as pitiable as in their first avowal to himself. He blushed for the"
"x121","narrow-minded counsel which he was obliged to expose. The conversation"
"x121","between them at Northanger had been of the most unfriendly kind. Henry's"
"x121","indignation on hearing how Catherine had been treated, on comprehending"
"x121","his father's views, and being ordered to acquiesce in them, had been"
"x121","open and bold. The general, accustomed on every ordinary occasion to"
"x121","give the law in his family, prepared for no reluctance but of feeling,"
"x121","no opposing desire that should dare to clothe itself in words, could ill"
"x121","brook the opposition of his son, steady as the sanction of reason and"
"x121","the dictate of conscience could make it. But, in such a cause, his"
"x121","anger, though it must shock, could not intimidate Henry, who was"
"x121","sustained in his purpose by a conviction of its justice. He felt himself"
"x121","bound as much in honour as in affection to Miss Morland, and believing"
"x121","that heart to be his own which he had been directed to gain, no unworthy"
"x121","retraction of a tacit consent, no reversing decree of unjustifiable"
"x121","anger, could shake his fidelity, or influence the resolutions it"
"x121","prompted."
"x121",""
"x121","He steadily refused to accompany his father into Herefordshire, an"
"x121","engagement formed almost at the moment to promote the dismissal of"
"x121","Catherine, and as steadily declared his intention of offering her his"
"x121","hand. The general was furious in his anger, and they parted in dreadful"
"x121","disagreement. Henry, in an agitation of mind which many solitary hours"
"x121","were required to compose, had returned almost instantly to Woodston,"
"x121","and, on the afternoon of the following day, had begun his journey to"
"x121","Fullerton."

"x121","CHAPTER 31"
"x121",""
"x121",""
"x121","Mr. and Mrs. Morland's surprise on being applied to by Mr. Tilney for"
"x121","their consent to his marrying their daughter was, for a few minutes,"
"x121","considerable, it having never entered their heads to suspect an"
"x121","attachment on either side; but as nothing, after all, could be more"
"x121","natural than Catherine's being beloved, they soon learnt to consider it"
"x121","with only the happy agitation of gratified pride, and, as far as they"
"x121","alone were concerned, had not a single objection to start. His pleasing"
"x121","manners and good sense were self-evident recommendations; and having"
"x121","never heard evil of him, it was not their way to suppose any evil could"
"x121","be told. Goodwill supplying the place of experience, his character"
"x121","needed no attestation. ""Catherine would make a sad, heedless young"
"x121","housekeeper to be sure,"" was her mother's foreboding remark; but quick"
"x121","was the consolation of there being nothing like practice."
"x121",""
"x121","There was but one obstacle, in short, to be mentioned; but till that one"
"x121","was removed, it must be impossible for them to sanction the engagement."
"x121","Their tempers were mild, but their principles were steady, and while"
"x121","his parent so expressly forbade the connection, they could not allow"
"x121","themselves to encourage it. That the general should come forward to"
"x121","solicit the alliance, or that he should even very heartily approve it,"
"x121","they were not refined enough to make any parading stipulation; but"
"x121","the decent appearance of consent must be yielded, and that once"
"x121","obtained--and their own hearts made them trust that it could not be"
"x121","very long denied--their willing approbation was instantly to follow. His"
"x121","consent was all that they wished for. They were no more inclined than"
"x121","entitled to demand his money. Of a very considerable fortune, his son"
"x121","was, by marriage settlements, eventually secure; his present income was"
"x121","an income of independence and comfort, and under every pecuniary view,"
"x121","it was a match beyond the claims of their daughter."
"x121",""
"x121","The young people could not be surprised at a decision like this. They"
"x121","felt and they deplored--but they could not resent it; and they parted,"
"x121","endeavouring to hope that such a change in the general, as each believed"
"x121","almost impossible, might speedily take place, to unite them again in"
"x121","the fullness of privileged affection. Henry returned to what was now"
"x121","his only home, to watch over his young plantations, and extend his"
"x121","improvements for her sake, to whose share in them he looked anxiously"
"x121","forward; and Catherine remained at Fullerton to cry. Whether the"
"x121","torments of absence were softened by a clandestine correspondence, let"
"x121","us not inquire. Mr. and Mrs. Morland never did--they had been too kind"
"x121","to exact any promise; and whenever Catherine received a letter, as, at"
"x121","that time, happened pretty often, they always looked another way."
"x121",""
"x121","The anxiety, which in this state of their attachment must be the portion"
"x121","of Henry and Catherine, and of all who loved either, as to its final"
"x121","event, can hardly extend, I fear, to the bosom of my readers, who will"
"x121","see in the tell-tale compression of the pages before them, that we are"
"x121","all hastening together to perfect felicity. The means by which their"
"x121","early marriage was effected can be the only doubt: what probable"
"x121","circumstance could work upon a temper like the general's? The"
"x121","circumstance which chiefly availed was the marriage of his daughter with"
"x121","a man of fortune and consequence, which took place in the course of"
"x121","the summer--an accession of dignity that threw him into a fit of good"
"x121","humour, from which he did not recover till after Eleanor had obtained"
"x121","his forgiveness of Henry, and his permission for him ""to be a fool if he"
"x121","liked it!"""
"x121",""
"x121","The marriage of Eleanor Tilney, her removal from all the evils of such"
"x121","a home as Northanger had been made by Henry's banishment, to the home of"
"x121","her choice and the man of her choice, is an event which I expect to"
"x121","give general satisfaction among all her acquaintance. My own joy on the"
"x121","occasion is very sincere. I know no one more entitled, by unpretending"
"x121","merit, or better prepared by habitual suffering, to receive and enjoy"
"x121","felicity. Her partiality for this gentleman was not of recent origin;"
"x121","and he had been long withheld only by inferiority of situation from"
"x121","addressing her. His unexpected accession to title and fortune had"
"x121","removed all his difficulties; and never had the general loved his"
"x121","daughter so well in all her hours of companionship, utility, and patient"
"x121","endurance as when he first hailed her ""Your Ladyship!"" Her husband was"
"x121","really deserving of her; independent of his peerage, his wealth, and"
"x121","his attachment, being to a precision the most charming young man in the"
"x121","world. Any further definition of his merits must be unnecessary; the"
"x121","most charming young man in the world is instantly before the imagination"
"x121","of us all. Concerning the one in question, therefore, I have only to"
"x121","add--aware that the rules of composition forbid the introduction of a"
"x121","character not connected with my fable--that this was the very"
"x121","gentleman whose negligent servant left behind him that collection of"
"x121","washing-bills, resulting from a long visit at Northanger, by which my"
"x121","heroine was involved in one of her most alarming adventures."
"x121",""
"x121","The influence of the viscount and viscountess in their brother's behalf"
"x121","was assisted by that right understanding of Mr. Morland's circumstances"
"x121","which, as soon as the general would allow himself to be informed, they"
"x121","were qualified to give. It taught him that he had been scarcely"
"x121","more misled by Thorpe's first boast of the family wealth than by his"
"x121","subsequent malicious overthrow of it; that in no sense of the word were"
"x121","they necessitous or poor, and that Catherine would have three thousand"
"x121","pounds. This was so material an amendment of his late expectations that"
"x121","it greatly contributed to smooth the descent of his pride; and by no"
"x121","means without its effect was the private intelligence, which he was at"
"x121","some pains to procure, that the Fullerton estate, being entirely at"
"x121","the disposal of its present proprietor, was consequently open to every"
"x121","greedy speculation."
"x121",""
"x121","On the strength of this, the general, soon after Eleanor's marriage,"
"x121","permitted his son to return to Northanger, and thence made him the"
"x121","bearer of his consent, very courteously worded in a page full of empty"
"x121","professions to Mr. Morland. The event which it authorized soon followed:"
"x121","Henry and Catherine were married, the bells rang, and everybody smiled;"
"x121","and, as this took place within a twelvemonth from the first day of their"
"x121","meeting, it will not appear, after all the dreadful delays occasioned by"
"x121","the general's cruelty, that they were essentially hurt by it. To begin"
"x121","perfect happiness at the respective ages of twenty-six and eighteen is"
"x121","to do pretty well; and professing myself moreover convinced that the"
"x121","general's unjust interference, so far from being really injurious to"
"x121","their felicity, was perhaps rather conducive to it, by improving their"
"x121","knowledge of each other, and adding strength to their attachment,"
"x121","I leave it to be settled, by whomsoever it may concern, whether the"
"x121","tendency of this work be altogether to recommend parental tyranny, or"
"x121","reward filial disobedience."

"x21839","INTRODUCTION"
"x21839",""
"x21839",""
"x21839","With the title of _Sense and Sensibility_ is connected one of those minor"
"x21839","problems which delight the cummin-splitters of criticism. In the _Cecilia_"
"x21839","of Madame D'Arblay--the forerunner, if not the model, of Miss Austen--is a"
"x21839","sentence which at first sight suggests some relationship to the name of"
"x21839","the book which, in the present series, inaugurated Miss Austen's novels."
"x21839","'The whole of this unfortunate business'--says a certain didactic Dr."
"x21839","Lyster, talking in capitals, towards the end of volume three of"
"x21839","_Cecilia_--'has been the result of PRIDE and PREJUDICE,' and looking to"
"x21839","the admitted familiarity of Miss Austen with Madame D'Arblay's work, it"
"x21839","has been concluded that Miss Austen borrowed from _Cecilia_, the title of"
"x21839","her second novel. But here comes in the little problem to which we have"
"x21839","referred. _Pride and Prejudice_ it is true, was written and finished"
"x21839","before _Sense and Sensibility_--its original title for several years being"
"x21839","_First Impressions_. Then, in 1797, the author fell to work upon an older"
"x21839","essay in letters _a la_ Richardson, called _Elinor and Marianne_, which"
"x21839","she re-christened _Sense and Sensibility._ This, as we know, was her first"
"x21839","published book; and whatever may be the connection between the title of"
"x21839","_Pride and Prejudice_ and the passage in _Cecilia_, there is an obvious"
"x21839","connection between the title of _Pride and Prejudice_ and the _title of"
"x21839","Sense and Sensibility_. If Miss Austen re-christened _Elinor and"
"x21839","Marianne_ before she changed the title of _First Impressions_, as she well"
"x21839","may have, it is extremely unlikely that the name of _Pride and Prejudice_"
"x21839","has anything to do with _Cecilia_ (which, besides, had been published at"
"x21839","least twenty years before). Upon the whole, therefore, it is most likely"
"x21839","that the passage in Madame D'Arblay is a mere coincidence; and that in"
"x21839","_Sense and Sensibility_, as well as in the novel that succeeded it in"
"x21839","publication, Miss Austen, after the fashion of the old morality plays,"
"x21839","simply substituted the leading characteristics of her principal personages"
"x21839","for their names. Indeed, in _Sense and Sensibility_ the sense of Elinor,"
"x21839","and the sensibility (or rather _sensiblerie_) of Marianne, are markedly"
"x21839","emphasised in the opening pages of the book But Miss Austen subsequently,"
"x21839","and, as we think, wisely, discarded in her remaining efforts the cheap"
"x21839","attraction of an alliterative title. _Emma_ and _Persuasion, Northanger"
"x21839","Abbey_ and _Mansfield Park_, are names far more in consonance with the"
"x21839","quiet tone of her easy and unobtrusive art."
"x21839",""
"x21839","_Elinor and Marianne_ was originally written about 1792. After the"
"x21839","completion--or partial completion, for it was again revised in"
"x21839","1811--of _First Impressions_ (subsequently _Pride and Prejudice_),"
"x21839","Miss Austen set about recasting _Elinor and Marianne_, then composed"
"x21839","in the form of letters; and she had no sooner accomplished this task,"
"x21839","than she began _Northanger Abbey_. It would be interesting to know to"
"x21839","what extent she remodelled _Sense and Sensibility_ in 1797-98, for we"
"x21839","are told that previous to its publication in 1811 she again devoted a"
"x21839","considerable time to its preparation for the press, and it is clear"
"x21839","that this does not mean the correction of proofs alone, but also a"
"x21839","preliminary revision of MS. Especially would it be interesting if we"
"x21839","could ascertain whether any of its more finished passages, _e.g._ the"
"x21839","admirable conversation between the Miss Dashwoods and Willoughby in"
"x21839","chapter x., were the result of those fallow and apparently barren"
"x21839","years at Bath and Southampton, or whether they were already part of"
"x21839","the second version of 1797-98. But upon this matter the records are"
"x21839","mute. A careful examination of the correspondence published by Lord"
"x21839","Brabourne in 1884 only reveals two definite references to _Sense and"
"x21839","Sensibility_ and these are absolutely unfruitful in suggestion. In"
"x21839","April 1811 she speaks of having corrected two sheets of 'S and S,'"
"x21839","which she has scarcely a hope of getting out in the following June;"
"x21839","and in September, an extract from the diary of another member of the"
"x21839","family indirectly discloses the fact that the book had by that time"
"x21839","been published. This extract is a brief reference to a letter which"
"x21839","had been received from Cassandra Austen, begging her correspondent not"
"x21839","to mention that Aunt Jane wrote _Sense and Sensibility._ Beyond these"
"x21839","minute items of information, and the statement--already referred to in"
"x21839","the Introduction to _Pride and Prejudice_--that she considered herself"
"x21839","overpaid for the labour she had bestowed upon it, absolutely nothing"
"x21839","seems to have been preserved by her descendants respecting her first"
"x21839","printed effort. In the absence of particulars some of her critics have"
"x21839","fallen to speculate upon the reason which made her select it, and not"
"x21839","_Pride and Prejudice_, for her debut; and they have, perhaps"
"x21839","naturally, found in the fact a fresh confirmation of that traditional"
"x21839","blindness of authors to their own best work, which is one of the"
"x21839","commonplaces of literary history. But this is to premise that she"
"x21839","_did_ regard it as her masterpiece, a fact which, apart from this"
"x21839","accident of priority of issue, is, as far as we are aware, nowhere"
"x21839","asserted. A simpler solution is probably that, of the three novels she"
"x21839","had written or sketched by 1811, _Pride and Prejudice_ was languishing"
"x21839","under the stigma of having been refused by one bookseller without the"
"x21839","formality of inspection, while _Northanger Abbey_ was lying _perdu_ in"
"x21839","another bookseller's drawer at Bath. In these circumstances it is"
"x21839","intelligible that she should turn to _Sense and Sensibility_, when, at"
"x21839","length--upon the occasion of a visit to her brother in London in the"
"x21839","spring of 1811--Mr. T. Egerton of the 'Military Library,' Whitehall,"
"x21839","dawned upon the horizon as a practicable publisher."
"x21839",""
"x21839","By the time _Sense and Sensibility_ left the press, Miss Austen was"
"x21839","again domiciled at Chawton Cottage. For those accustomed to the"
"x21839","swarming reviews of our day, with their Babel of notices, it may seem"
"x21839","strange that there should be no record of the effect produced, seeing"
"x21839","that, as already stated, the book sold well enough to enable its"
"x21839","putter-forth to hand over to its author what Mr. Gargery, in _Great"
"x21839","Expectations_, would have described as 'a cool L150.' Surely Mr."
"x21839","Egerton, who had visited Miss Austen at Sloane Street, must have later"
"x21839","conveyed to her some intelligence of the way in which her work had"
"x21839","been welcomed by the public. But if he did, it is no longer"
"x21839","discoverable. Mr. Austen Leigh, her first and best biographer, could"
"x21839","find no account either of the publication or of the author's feelings"
"x21839","thereupon. As far as it is possible to judge, the critical verdicts"
"x21839","she obtained were mainly derived from her own relatives and intimate"
"x21839","friends, and some of these latter--if one may trust a little anthology"
"x21839","which she herself collected, and from which Mr. Austen Leigh prints"
"x21839","extracts--must have been more often exasperating than sympathetic. The"
"x21839","long chorus of intelligent approval by which she was afterwards"
"x21839","greeted did not begin to be really audible before her death, and her"
"x21839","'fit audience' during her lifetime must have been emphatically 'few,'"
"x21839","Of two criticisms which came out in the _Quarterly_ early in the"
"x21839","century, she could only have seen one, that of 1815; the other, by"
"x21839","Archbishop Whately, the first which treated her in earnest, did not"
"x21839","appear until she had been three years dead. Dr. Whately deals mainly"
"x21839","with _Mansfield Park_ and _Persuasion_; his predecessor professed to"
"x21839","review _Emma_, though he also gives brief summaries of _Sense and"
"x21839","Sensibility_ and _Pride and Prejudice_. Mr. Austen Leigh, we think,"
"x21839","speaks too contemptuously of this initial notice of 1815. If, at"
"x21839","certain points, it is half-hearted and inadequate, it is still fairly"
"x21839","accurate in its recognition of Miss Austen's supreme merit, as"
"x21839","contrasted with her contemporaries--to wit, her skill in investing the"
"x21839","fortunes of ordinary characters and the narrative of common"
"x21839","occurrences with all the sustained excitement of romance. The Reviewer"
"x21839","points out very justly that this kind of work, 'being deprived of all"
"x21839","that, according to Bayes, goes ""to elevate and surprise,"" must make"
"x21839","amends by displaying depth of knowledge and dexterity of execution.'"
"x21839","And in these qualities, even with such living competitors of her own"
"x21839","sex as Miss Edgeworth and Miss Brunton (whose _Self-control_ came out"
"x21839","in the same year as _Sense and Sensibility_), he does not scruple to"
"x21839","declare that 'Miss Austen stands almost alone.' If he omits to lay"
"x21839","stress upon her judgment, her nice sense of fitness, her restraint,"
"x21839","her fine irony, and the delicacy of her artistic touch, something must"
"x21839","be allowed for the hesitations and reservations which invariably beset"
"x21839","the critical pioneer."
"x21839",""
"x21839","To contend, however, for a moment that the present volume is Miss"
"x21839","Austen's greatest, as it was her first published, novel, would be a"
"x21839","mere exercise in paradox. There are, who swear by _Persuasion_; there"
"x21839","are, who prefer _Emma_ and _Mansfield Park_; there is a large"
"x21839","contingent for _Pride and Prejudice_; and there is even a section"
"x21839","which advocates the pre-eminence of _Northanger Abbey_. But no one, as"
"x21839","far as we can remember, has ever put _Sense and Sensibility_ first,"
"x21839","nor can we believe that its author did so herself. And yet it is she"
"x21839","herself who has furnished the standard by which we judge it, and it is"
"x21839","by comparison with _Pride and Prejudice_, in which the leading"
"x21839","characters are also two sisters, that we assess and depress its merit."
"x21839","The Elinor and Marianne of _Sense and Sensibility_ are only inferior"
"x21839","when they are contrasted with the Elizabeth and Jane of _Pride and"
"x21839","Prejudice_; and even then, it is probably because we personally like"
"x21839","the handsome and amiable Jane Bennet rather better than the obsolete"
"x21839","survival of the sentimental novel represented by Marianne Dashwood."
"x21839","Darcy and Bingley again are much more 'likeable' (to use Lady"
"x21839","Queensberry's word) than the colourless Edward Ferrars and the"
"x21839","stiff-jointed Colonel Brandon. Yet it might not unfairly be contended"
"x21839","that there is more fidelity to what Mr. Thomas Hardy has termed"
"x21839","'life's little ironies' in Miss Austen's disposal of the two Miss"
"x21839","Dashwoods than there is in her disposal of the heroines of _Pride and"
"x21839","Prejudice_. Every one does not get a Bingley, or a Darcy (with a"
"x21839","park); but a good many sensible girls like Elinor pair off contentedly"
"x21839","with poor creatures like Edward Ferrars, while not a few enthusiasts"
"x21839","like Marianne decline at last upon middle-aged colonels with flannel"
"x21839","waistcoats. George Eliot, we fancy, would have held that the fates of"
"x21839","Elinor and Marianne were more probable than the fortunes of Jane and"
"x21839","Eliza Bennet. That, of the remaining characters, there is certainly"
"x21839","none to rival Mr. Bennet, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, or the"
"x21839","ineffable Mr. Collins, of _Pride and Prejudice_, is true; but we"
"x21839","confess to a kindness for vulgar matchmaking Mrs. Jennings with her"
"x21839","still-room 'parmaceti for an inward bruise' in the shape of a glass of"
"x21839","old Constantia; and for the diluted Squire Western, Sir John"
"x21839","Middleton, whose horror of being alone carries him to the point of"
"x21839","rejoicing in the acquisition of _two_ to the population of London."
"x21839","Excellent again are Mr. Palmer and his wife; excellent, in their"
"x21839","sordid veracity, the self-seeking figures of the Miss Steeles. But the"
"x21839","pearls of the book must be allowed to be that egregious amateur in"
"x21839","toothpick-cases, Mr. Robert Ferrars (with his excursus in chapter"
"x21839","xxxvi. on life in a cottage), and the admirably-matched Mr. and Mrs."
"x21839","John Dashwood. Miss Austen herself has never done anything better than"
"x21839","the inimitable and oft-quoted chapter wherein is debated between the"
"x21839","last-named pair the momentous matter of the amount to be devoted to"
"x21839","Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters; while the suggestion in chapters"
"x21839","xxxiii. and xxxiv. that the owner of Norland was once within some"
"x21839","thousands of having to sell out at a loss, deserves to be remembered"
"x21839","with that other memorable escape of Sir Roger de Coverley's ancestor,"
"x21839","who was only not killed in the civil wars because 'he was sent out of"
"x21839","the field upon a private message, the day before the battle of"
"x21839","Worcester.'"
"x21839",""
"x21839","Of local colouring there is as little in _Sense and Sensibility_ as in"
"x21839","_Pride and Prejudice_. It is not unlikely that some memories of"
"x21839","Steventon may survive in Norland; and it may be noted that there is"
"x21839","actually a Barton Place to the north of Exeter, not far from Lord"
"x21839","Iddesleigh's well-known seat of Upton Pynes. It is scarcely possible,"
"x21839","also, not to believe that, in Mrs. Jennings's description of"
"x21839","Delaford--'a nice place, I can tell you; exactly what I call a nice"
"x21839","old-fashioned place, full of comforts and conveniences; quite shut in"
"x21839","with great garden walls that are covered with the best fruit-trees in"
"x21839","the country; and such a mulberry tree in one corner!'--Miss Austen had"
"x21839","in mind some real Hampshire or Devonshire country house. In any case,"
"x21839","it comes nearer a picture than what we usually get from her pen. 'Then"
"x21839","there is a dovecote, some delightful stew-ponds, and a very pretty"
"x21839","canal; and everything, in short, that one could wish for; and,"
"x21839","moreover, it is close to the church, and only a quarter of a mile"
"x21839","from the turnpike-road, so 'tis never dull, for if you only go and sit"
"x21839","up in an old yew arbour behind the house, you may see all the"
"x21839","carriages that pass along.' The last lines suggest those quaint"
"x21839","'gazebos' and alcoves, which, in the coaching days, were so often to"
"x21839","be found perched at the roadside, where one might sit and watch the"
"x21839","Dover or Canterbury stage go whirling by. Of genteel accomplishments"
"x21839","there is a touch In the 'landscape in coloured silks' which Charlotte"
"x21839","Palmer had worked at school (chap, xxvi.); and of old remedies for the"
"x21839","lost art of swooning, in the 'lavender drops' of chapter xxix. The"
"x21839","mention of a dance as a 'little hop' in chapter ix. reads like a"
"x21839","premature instance of middle Victorian slang. But nothing is new--even"
"x21839","in a novel--and 'hop,' in this sense, is at least as old as _Joseph"
"x21839","Andrews_."

"x21839",""
"x21839",""
"x21839","The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex. Their estate"
"x21839","was large, and their residence was at Norland Park, in the centre of"
"x21839","their property, where, for many generations, they had lived in so"
"x21839","respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their"
"x21839","surrounding acquaintance. The late owner of this estate was a single"
"x21839","man, who lived to a very advanced age, and who for many years of his"
"x21839","life, had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister. But her"
"x21839","death, which happened ten years before his own, produced a great"
"x21839","alteration in his home; for to supply her loss, he invited and"
"x21839","received into his house the family of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood,"
"x21839","the legal inheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he"
"x21839","intended to bequeath it. In the society of his nephew and niece, and"
"x21839","their children, the old Gentleman's days were comfortably spent. His"
"x21839","attachment to them all increased. The constant attention of Mr. and"
"x21839","Mrs. Henry Dashwood to his wishes, which proceeded not merely from"
"x21839","interest, but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid"
"x21839","comfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness of the"
"x21839","children added a relish to his existence."
"x21839",""
"x21839","By a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one son: by his present"
"x21839","lady, three daughters. The son, a steady respectable young man, was"
"x21839","amply provided for by the fortune of his mother, which had been large,"
"x21839","and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age. By his own"
"x21839","marriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards, he added to his"
"x21839","wealth. To him therefore the succession to the Norland estate was not"
"x21839","so really important as to his sisters; for their fortune, independent"
"x21839","of what might arise to them from their father's inheriting that"
"x21839","property, could be but small. Their mother had nothing, and their"
"x21839","father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal; for the"
"x21839","remaining moiety of his first wife's fortune was also secured to her"
"x21839","child, and he had only a life-interest in it."
"x21839",""
"x21839","The old gentleman died: his will was read, and like almost every"
"x21839","other will, gave as much disappointment as pleasure. He was neither so"
"x21839","unjust, nor so ungrateful, as to leave his estate from his nephew; but"
"x21839","he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the"
"x21839","bequest. Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife"
"x21839","and daughters than for himself or his son; but to his son, and his"
"x21839","son's son, a child of four years old, it was secured, in such a way,"
"x21839","as to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most"
"x21839","dear to him, and who most needed a provision by any charge on the"
"x21839","estate, or by any sale of its valuable woods. The whole was tied up"
"x21839","for the benefit of this child, who, in occasional visits with his"
"x21839","father and mother at Norland, had so far gained on the affections of"
"x21839","his uncle, by such attractions as are by no means unusual in children"
"x21839","of two or three years old; an imperfect articulation, an earnest"
"x21839","desire of having his own way, many cunning tricks, and a great deal of"
"x21839","noise, as to outweigh all the value of all the attention which, for"
"x21839","years, he had received from his niece and her daughters. He meant not"
"x21839","to be unkind, however, and, as a mark of his affection for the three"
"x21839","girls, he left them a thousand pounds a-piece."
"x21839",""
"x21839","Mr. Dashwood's disappointment was, at first, severe; but his temper"
"x21839","was cheerful and sanguine; and he might reasonably hope to live many"
"x21839","years, and by living economically, lay by a considerable sum from the"
"x21839","produce of an estate already large, and capable of almost immediate"
"x21839","improvement. But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, was"
"x21839","his only one twelvemonth. He survived his uncle no longer; and ten"
"x21839","thousand pounds, including the late legacies, was all that remained"
"x21839","for his widow and daughters."
"x21839",""
"x21839","His son was sent for as soon as his danger was known, and to him Mr."
"x21839","Dashwood recommended, with all the strength and urgency which illness"
"x21839","could command, the interest of his mother-in-law and sisters."
"x21839",""
"x21839","Mr. John Dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the"
"x21839","family; but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at"
"x21839","such a time, and he promised to do every thing in his power to make"
"x21839","them comfortable. His father was rendered easy by such an assurance,"
"x21839","and Mr. John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there"
"x21839","might prudently be in his power to do for them."

"x21839","He was not an ill-disposed young man, unless to be rather cold hearted"
"x21839","and rather selfish is to be ill-disposed: but he was, in general, well"
"x21839","respected; for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of"
"x21839","his ordinary duties. Had he married a more amiable woman, he might"
"x21839","have been made still more respectable than he was: he might even have"
"x21839","been made amiable himself; for he was very young when he married, and"
"x21839","very fond of his wife. But Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong caricature"
"x21839","of himself; more narrow-minded and selfish."
"x21839",""
"x21839","When he gave his promise to his father, he meditated within himself to"
"x21839","increase the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand"
"x21839","pounds a-piece. He then really thought himself equal to it. The"
"x21839","prospect of four thousand a-year, in addition to his present income,"
"x21839","besides the remaining half of his own mother's fortune, warmed his"
"x21839","heart, and made him feel capable of generosity. ""Yes, he would give"
"x21839","them three thousand pounds: it would be liberal and handsome! It would"
"x21839","be enough to make them completely easy. Three thousand pounds! he"
"x21839","could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience."" He"
"x21839","thought of it all day long, and for many days successively, and he did"
"x21839","not repent."
"x21839",""
"x21839","No sooner was his father's funeral over, than Mrs. John Dashwood,"
"x21839","without sending any notice of her intention to her mother-in-law,"
"x21839","arrived with her child and their attendants. No one could dispute her"
"x21839","right to come; the house was her husband's from the moment of his"
"x21839","father's decease; but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the"
"x21839","greater, and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood's situation, with only common"
"x21839","feelings, must have been highly unpleasing. But in _her_ mind there"
"x21839","was a sense of honor so keen, a generosity so romantic, that any"
"x21839","offence of the kind, by whomsoever given or received, was to her a"
"x21839","source of immovable disgust. Mrs. John Dashwood had never been a"

"x21839","opportunity, till the present, of showing them with how little"
"x21839","attention to the comfort of other people she could act when occasion"
"x21839","required it."
"x21839",""
"x21839","So acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour, and so"

"x21839","arrival of the latter, she would have quitted the house for ever, had"
"x21839","not the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on"
"x21839","the propriety of going, and her own tender love for all her three"

"x21839",""
"x21839","Elinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was so effectual, possessed"

"x21839","enabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage of them all,"
"x21839","that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have led"
"x21839","to imprudence. She had an excellent heart; her disposition was"
"x21839","affectionate, and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern"

"x21839","their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection"

"x21839","in future. Elinor, too, was deeply afflicted; but still she could"

"x21839","friendly a style as could not fail of giving pleasure to his cousin;"
"x21839","more especially at a moment when she was suffering under the cold and"
"x21839","unfeeling behaviour of her nearer connections. She needed no time for"
"x21839","deliberation or inquiry. Her resolution was formed as she read. The"
"x21839","situation of Barton, in a county so far distant from Sussex as"
"x21839","Devonshire, which, but a few hours before, would have been a"
"x21839","sufficient objection to outweigh every possible advantage belonging to"
"x21839","the place, was now its first recommendation. To quit the neighbourhood"
"x21839","of Norland was no longer an evil; it was an object of desire; it was a"
"x21839","blessing, in comparison of the misery of continuing her"
"x21839","daughter-in-law's guest; and to remove for ever from that beloved"
"x21839","place would be less painful than to inhabit or visit it while such a"
"x21839","woman was its mistress. She instantly wrote Sir John Middleton her"
"x21839","acknowledgment of his kindness, and her acceptance of his proposal;"
"x21839","and then hastened to show both letters to her daughters, that she"
"x21839","might be secure of their approbation before her answer were sent."
"x21839",""
"x21839","Elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle"
"x21839","at some distance from Norland, than immediately amongst their present"
"x21839","acquaintance. On _that_ head, therefore, it was not for her to oppose"
"x21839","her mother's intention of removing into Devonshire. The house, too, as"
"x21839","described by Sir John, was on so simple a scale, and the rent so"
"x21839","uncommonly moderate, as to leave her no right of objection on either"

"x21839","charm to her fancy, though it was a removal from the vicinity of"
"x21839","Norland beyond her wishes, she made no attempt to dissuade her mother"

"x21839","that she was provided with a house, and should incommode them no"
"x21839","longer than till every thing were ready for her inhabiting it. They"
"x21839","heard her with surprise. Mrs. John Dashwood said nothing; but her"
"x21839","husband civilly hoped that she would not be settled far from Norland."
"x21839","She had great satisfaction in replying that she was going into"
"x21839","Devonshire. Edward turned hastily towards her, on hearing this, and,"
"x21839","in a voice of surprise and concern, which required no explanation to"
"x21839","her, repeated, ""Devonshire! Are you, indeed, going there? So far from"
"x21839","hence! And to what part of it?"" She explained the situation. It was"
"x21839","within four miles northward of Exeter."
"x21839",""
"x21839","""It is but a cottage,"" she continued, ""but I hope to see many of my"

"x21839",""
"x21839","She concluded with a very kind invitation to Mr. and Mrs. John"
"x21839","Dashwood to visit her at Barton; and to Edward she gave one with still"
"x21839","greater affection. Though her late conversation with her"
"x21839","daughter-in-law had made her resolve on remaining at Norland no longer"
"x21839","than was unavoidable, it had not produced the smallest effect on her"
"x21839","in that point to which it principally tended. To separate Edward and"
"x21839","Elinor was as far from being her object as ever; and she wished to"
"x21839","show Mrs. John Dashwood, by this pointed invitation to her brother,"
"x21839","how totally she disregarded her disapprobation of the match."
"x21839",""
"x21839","Mr. John Dashwood told his mother again and again how exceedingly"
"x21839","sorry he was that she had taken a house at such a distance from"
"x21839","Norland as to prevent his being of any service to her in removing her"
"x21839","furniture. He really felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion; for"
"x21839","the very exertion to which he had limited the performance of his"
"x21839","promise to his father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable."
"x21839","The furniture was all sent around by water. It chiefly consisted of"
"x21839","household linen, plate, china, and books, with a handsome pianoforte"
"x21839","of Marianne's. Mrs. John Dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh:"
"x21839","she could not help feeling it hard that as Mrs. Dashwood's income"
"x21839","would be so trifling in comparison with their own, she should have any"
"x21839","handsome article of furniture."
"x21839",""
"x21839","Mrs. Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth; it was ready"

"x21839","disposal of her effects at Norland, and to determine her future"
"x21839","household, before she set off for the west; and this, as she was"
"x21839","exceedingly rapid in the performance of everything that interested"
"x21839","her, was soon done. The horses which were left her by her husband had"
"x21839","been sold soon after his death, and an opportunity now offering of"
"x21839","disposing of her carriage, she agreed to sell that likewise at the"
"x21839","earnest advice of her eldest daughter. For the comfort of her"
"x21839","children, had she consulted only her own wishes, she would have kept"
"x21839","it; but the discretion of Elinor prevailed. _Her_ wisdom too limited"
"x21839","the number of their servants to three; two maids and a man, with whom"
"x21839","they were speedily provided from amongst those who had formed their"
"x21839","establishment at Norland."
"x21839",""
"x21839","The man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into"

"x21839","going directly to the cottage to being a visitor at Barton Park; and"
"x21839","she relied so undoubtingly on Sir John's description of the house, as"
"x21839","to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her"
"x21839","own. Her eagerness to be gone from Norland was preserved from"
"x21839","diminution by the evident satisfaction of her daughter-in-law in the"
"x21839","prospect of her removal; a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted"
"x21839","to be concealed under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure."
"x21839","Now was the time when her son-in-law's promise to his father might"
"x21839","with particular propriety be fulfilled. Since he had neglected to do"
"x21839","it on first coming to the estate, their quitting his house might be"
"x21839","looked on as the most suitable period for its accomplishment. But Mrs."
"x21839","Dashwood began shortly to give over every hope of the kind, and to be"
"x21839","convinced, from the general drift of his discourse, that his"
"x21839","assistance extended no farther than their maintenance for six months"
"x21839","at Norland. He so frequently talked of the increasing expenses of"
"x21839","housekeeping, and of the perpetual demands upon his purse, which a man"
"x21839","of any consequence in the world was beyond calculation exposed to,"

"x21839","drew towards the end of it, their interest in the appearance of a"
"x21839","country which they were to inhabit overcame their dejection, and a"
"x21839","view of Barton Valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness. It"
"x21839","was a pleasant fertile spot, well wooded, and rich in pasture. After"
"x21839","winding along it for more than a mile, they reached their own house. A"
"x21839","small green court was the whole of its demesne in front; and a neat"
"x21839","wicket gate admitted them into it."
"x21839",""
"x21839","As a house, Barton Cottage, though small, was comfortable and compact;"
"x21839","but as a cottage it was defective, for the building was regular, the"
"x21839","roof was tiled, the window shutters were not painted green, nor were"
"x21839","the walls covered with honeysuckles. A narrow passage led directly"
"x21839","through the house into the garden behind. On each side of the entrance"
"x21839","was a sitting room, about sixteen feet square; and beyond them were"
"x21839","the offices and the stairs. Four bedrooms and two garrets formed the"
"x21839","rest of the house. It had not been built many years and was in good"
"x21839","repair. In comparison of Norland, it was poor and small indeed!--but"
"x21839","the tears which recollection called forth as they entered the house"
"x21839","were soon dried away. They were cheered by the joy of the servants on"
"x21839","their arrival, and each for the sake of the others resolved to appear"
"x21839","happy. It was very early in September; the season was fine, and from"
"x21839","first seeing the place under the advantage of good weather, they"
"x21839","received an impression in its favour which was of material service in"
"x21839","recommending it to their lasting approbation."

"x21839","The situation of the house was good. High hills rose immediately"
"x21839","behind, and at no great distance on each side; some of which were open"
"x21839","downs, the others cultivated and woody. The village of Barton was"
"x21839","chiefly on one of these hills, and formed a pleasant view from the"
"x21839","cottage windows. The prospect in front was more extensive; it"
"x21839","commanded the whole of the valley, and reached into the country"
"x21839","beyond. The hills which surrounded the cottage terminated the valley"
"x21839","in that direction; under another name, and in another course, it"
"x21839","branched out again between two of the steepest of them."

"x21839","With the size and furniture of the house Mrs. Dashwood was upon the"

"x21839","a delight to her; and she had at this time ready money enough to"
"x21839","supply all that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments. ""As"
"x21839","for the house itself, to be sure,"" said she, ""it is too small for our"
"x21839","family, but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the"
"x21839","present, as it is too late in the year for improvements. Perhaps in"
"x21839","the spring, if I have plenty of money, as I dare say I shall, we may"
"x21839","think about building. These parlors are both too small for such"
"x21839","parties of our friends as I hope to see often collected here; and I"
"x21839","have some thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them with"
"x21839","perhaps a part of the other, and so leave the remainder of that other"
"x21839","for an entrance; this, with a new drawing room which may be easily"
"x21839","added, and a bed-chamber and garret above, will make it a very snug"
"x21839","little cottage. I could wish the stairs were handsome. But one must"
"x21839","not expect every thing; though I suppose it would be no difficult"

"x21839","desire of their living in the most sociable terms with his family, and"

"x21839","elegance which her husband's wanted. But they would have been improved"

"x21839",""
"x21839",""
"x21839","Marianne's preserver, as Margaret, with more elegance than precision,"
"x21839","styled Willoughby, called at the cottage early the next morning to"
"x21839","make his personal enquiries. He was received by Mrs. Dashwood with"
"x21839","more than politeness; with a kindness which Sir John's account of him"
"x21839","and her own gratitude prompted; and every thing that passed during the"
"x21839","visit tended to assure him of the sense, elegance, mutual affection,"
"x21839","and domestic comfort of the family to whom accident had now introduced"
"x21839","him. Of their personal charms he had not required a second interview"
"x21839","to be convinced."
"x21839",""
"x21839","Miss Dashwood had a delicate complexion, regular features, and a"
"x21839","remarkably pretty figure. Marianne was still handsomer. Her form,"
"x21839","though not so correct as her sister's, in having the advantage of"
"x21839","height, was more striking; and her face was so lovely, that when in"
"x21839","the common cant of praise, she was called a beautiful girl, truth was"
"x21839","less violently outraged than usually happens. Her skin was very brown,"
"x21839","but, from its transparency, her complexion was uncommonly brilliant;"
"x21839","her features were all good; her smile was sweet and attractive; and in"
"x21839","her eyes, which were very dark, there was a life, a spirit, an"
"x21839","eagerness, which could hardily be seen without delight. From"
"x21839","Willoughby their expression was at first held back, by the"
"x21839","embarrassment which the remembrance of his assistance created. But"
"x21839","when this passed away, when her spirits became collected, when she saw"
"x21839","that to the perfect good-breeding of the gentleman, he united"
"x21839","frankness and vivacity, and above all, when she heard him declare,"
"x21839","that of music and dancing he was passionately fond, she gave him such"
"x21839","a look of approbation as secured the largest share of his discourse to"
"x21839","herself for the rest of his stay."
"x21839",""
"x21839","It was only necessary to mention any favourite amusement to engage her"
"x21839","to talk. She could not be silent when such points were introduced, and"
"x21839","she had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion. They speedily"
"x21839","discovered that their enjoyment of dancing and music was mutual, and"
"x21839","that it arose from a general conformity of judgment in all that"
"x21839","related to either. Encouraged by this to a further examination of his"
"x21839","opinions, she proceeded to question him on the subject of books; her"
"x21839","favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt upon with so"
"x21839","rapturous a delight, that any young man of five and twenty must have"
"x21839","been insensible indeed, not to become an immediate convert to the"
"x21839","excellence of such works, however disregarded before. Their taste was"
"x21839","strikingly alike. The same books, the same passages were idolized by"
"x21839","each; or if any difference appeared, any objection arose, it lasted no"
"x21839","longer than till the force of her arguments and the brightness of her"
"x21839","eyes could be displayed. He acquiesced in all her decisions, caught"
"x21839","all her enthusiasm; and long before his visit concluded, they"
"x21839","conversed with the familiarity of a long-established acquaintance."
"x21839",""
"x21839","""Well, Marianne,"" said Elinor, as soon as he had left them, ""for _one_"
"x21839","morning I think you have done pretty well. You have already"
"x21839","ascertained Mr. Willoughby's opinion in almost every matter of"
"x21839","importance. You know what he thinks of Cowper and Scott; you are"
"x21839","certain of his estimating their beauties as he ought, and you have"
"x21839","received every assurance of his admiring Pope no more than is proper."
"x21839","But how is your acquaintance to be long supported, under such"
"x21839","extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse? You will soon"
"x21839","have exhausted each favourite topic. Another meeting will suffice to"
"x21839","explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty, and second marriages,"
"x21839","and then you can have nothing farther to ask."""
"x21839",""
"x21839","""Elinor,"" cried Marianne, ""is this fair? is this just? are my ideas so"
"x21839","scanty? But I see what you mean. I have been too much at my ease, too"
"x21839","happy, too frank. I have erred against every common-place notion of"
"x21839","decorum; I have been open and sincere where I ought to have been"
"x21839","reserved, spiritless, dull, and deceitful:--had I talked only of the"
"x21839","weather and the roads, and had I spoken only once in ten minutes, this"
"x21839","reproach would have been spared."""
"x21839",""
"x21839","""My love,"" said her mother, ""you must not be offended with Elinor--she"
"x21839","was only in jest. I should scold her myself, if she were capable of"
"x21839","wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new"
"x21839","friend."" Marianne was softened in a moment."
"x21839",""
"x21839","Willoughby, on his side, gave every proof of his pleasure in their"
"x21839","acquaintance, which an evident wish of improving it could offer. He"
"x21839","came to them every day. To enquire after Marianne was at first his"
"x21839","excuse; but the encouragement of his reception, to which every day"
"x21839","gave greater kindness, made such an excuse unnecessary before it had"
"x21839","ceased to be possible, by Marianne's perfect recovery. She was"
"x21839","confined for some days to the house; but never had any confinement"
"x21839","been less irksome. Willoughby was a young man of good abilities, quick"
"x21839","imagination, lively spirits, and open, affectionate manners. He was"
"x21839","exactly formed to engage Marianne's heart, for with all this, he"
"x21839","joined not only a captivating person, but a natural ardour of mind"
"x21839","which was now roused and increased by the example of her own, and"
"x21839","which recommended him to her affection beyond every thing else."
"x21839",""
"x21839","His society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment. They read,"
"x21839","they talked, they sang together; his musical talents were"
"x21839","considerable; and he read with all the sensibility and spirit which"
"x21839","Edward had unfortunately wanted."
"x21839",""
"x21839","In Mrs. Dashwood's estimation he was as faultless as in Marianne's;"
"x21839","and Elinor saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity, in which he"
"x21839","strongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister, of saying too"
"x21839","much what he thought on every occasion, without attention to persons"
"x21839","or circumstances. In hastily forming and giving his opinion of other"
"x21839","people, in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of"
"x21839","undivided attention where his heart was engaged, and in slighting too"
"x21839","easily the forms of worldly propriety, he displayed a want of caution"
"x21839","which Elinor could not approve, in spite of all that he and Marianne"
"x21839","could say in its support."
"x21839",""
"x21839","Marianne began now to perceive that the desperation which had seized"
"x21839","her at sixteen and a half, of ever seeing a man who could satisfy her"
"x21839","ideas of perfection, had been rash and unjustifiable. Willoughby was"
"x21839","all that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour and in every"
"x21839","brighter period, as capable of attaching her; and his behaviour"
"x21839","declared his wishes to be in that respect as earnest, as his abilities"
"x21839","were strong."

"x21839","herself on having gained two such sons-in-law as Edward and"
"x21839","Willoughby."
"x21839",""
"x21839","Colonel Brandon's partiality for Marianne, which had so"
"x21839","early been discovered by his friends, now first became perceptible to"
"x21839","Elinor, when it ceased to be noticed by them. Their attention and wit"
"x21839","were drawn off to his more fortunate rival; and the raillery which the"
"x21839","other had incurred before any partiality arose, was removed when his"
"x21839","feelings began really to call for the ridicule so justly annexed to"
"x21839","sensibility. Elinor was obliged, though unwillingly, to believe that"
"x21839","the sentiments which Mrs. Jennings had assigned him for her own"
"x21839","satisfaction, were now actually excited by her sister; and that"
"x21839","however a general resemblance of disposition between the parties might"
"x21839","forward the affection of Mr. Willoughby, an equally striking"
"x21839","opposition of character was no hindrance to the regard of Colonel"
"x21839","Brandon. She saw it with concern; for what could a silent man of five"
"x21839","and thirty hope, when opposed to a very lively one of five and twenty?"
"x21839","and as she could not even wish him successful, she heartily wished him"
"x21839","indifferent. She liked him--in spite of his gravity and reserve, she"
"x21839","beheld in him an object of interest. His manners, though serious, were"
"x21839","mild; and his reserve appeared rather the result of some oppression of"
"x21839","spirits than of any natural gloominess of temper. Sir John had dropped"
"x21839","hints of past injuries and disappointments, which justified her belief"
"x21839","of his being an unfortunate man, and she regarded him with respect and"
"x21839","compassion."
"x21839",""
"x21839","Perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more because he was slighted"
"x21839","by Willoughby and Marianne, who, prejudiced against him for being"
"x21839","neither lively nor young, seemed resolved to undervalue his merits."
"x21839",""
"x21839","""Brandon is just the kind of man,"" said Willoughby one day, when they"
"x21839","were talking of him together, ""whom every body speaks well of, and"

"x21839",""

"x21839",""
"x21839",""
"x21839","Little had Mrs. Dashwood or her daughters imagined when they first"
"x21839","came into Devonshire, that so many engagements would arise to occupy"
"x21839","their time as shortly presented themselves, or that they should have"
"x21839","such frequent invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them"
"x21839","little leisure for serious employment. Yet such was the case. When"
"x21839","Marianne was recovered, the schemes of amusement at home and abroad,"
"x21839","which Sir John had been previously forming, were put into execution."
"x21839","The private balls at the park then began; and parties on the water"
"x21839","were made and accomplished as often as a showery October would allow."
"x21839","In every meeting of the kind Willoughby was included; and the ease and"
"x21839","familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly"
"x21839","calculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with the"
"x21839","Dashwoods, to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of"
"x21839","Marianne, of marking his animated admiration of her, and of receiving,"
"x21839","in her behaviour to himself, the most pointed assurance of her"
"x21839","affection."
"x21839",""
"x21839","Elinor could not be surprised at their attachment. She only wished"
"x21839","that it were less openly shown; and once or twice did venture to"
"x21839","suggest the propriety of some self-command to Marianne. But Marianne"
"x21839","abhorred all concealment where no real disgrace could attend"
"x21839","unreserve; and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not in"
"x21839","themselves illaudable, appeared to her not merely an unnecessary"
"x21839","effort, but a disgraceful subjection of reason to common-place and"
"x21839","mistaken notions. Willoughby thought the same; and their behaviour at"
"x21839","all times, was an illustration of their opinions."
"x21839",""
"x21839","When he was present she had no eyes for any one else. Every thing he"
"x21839","did, was right. Every thing he said, was clever. If their evenings at"

"x21839","rest of the party to get her a good hand. If dancing formed the"
"x21839","amusement of the night, they were partners for half the time; and when"
"x21839","obliged to separate for a couple of dances, were careful to stand"
"x21839","together and scarcely spoke a word to any body else. Such conduct made"

"x21839","This was the season of happiness to Marianne. Her heart was devoted to"

"x21839",""
"x21839","Elinor's happiness was not so great. Her heart was not so much at"
"x21839","ease, nor her satisfaction in their amusements so pure. They afforded"
"x21839","her no companion that could make amends for what she had left behind,"
"x21839","nor that could teach her to think of Norland with less regret than"
"x21839","ever. Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could supply to her the"
"x21839","conversation she missed; although the latter was an everlasting"
"x21839","talker, and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which"

"x21839","illness, and what he said to his wife a few minutes before he died."
"x21839","Lady Middleton was more agreeable than her mother only in being more"

"x21839","was a mere calmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do."
"x21839","Towards her husband and mother she was the same as to them; and"

"x21839","provided every thing were conducted in style and her two eldest"

"x21839","with the greatest delight, that Willoughby had given her a horse, one"
"x21839","that he had bred himself on his estate in Somersetshire, and which was"
"x21839","exactly calculated to carry a woman. Without considering that it was"

"x21839","related, and they were such as to make further entreaty on his side"

"x21839",""
"x21839","Edward remained a week at the cottage; he was earnestly pressed by"
"x21839","Mrs. Dashwood to stay longer; but, as if he were bent only on"
"x21839","self-mortification, he seemed resolved to be gone when his enjoyment"
"x21839","among his friends was at the height. His spirits, during the last two"
"x21839","or three days, though still very unequal, were greatly improved--he"
"x21839","grew more and more partial to the house and environs--never spoke of"
"x21839","going away without a sigh--declared his time to be wholly"
"x21839","disengaged--even doubted to what place he should go when he left"
"x21839","them--but still, go he must. Never had any week passed so quickly--he"
"x21839","could hardly believe it to be gone. He said so repeatedly; other"
"x21839","things he said too, which marked the turn of his feelings and gave the"
"x21839","lie to his actions. He had no pleasure at Norland; he detested being"
"x21839","in town; but either to Norland or London, he must go. He valued their"
"x21839","kindness beyond any thing, and his greatest happiness was in being"
"x21839","with them. Yet, he must leave them at the end of a week, in spite of"
"x21839","their wishes and his own, and without any restraint on his time."
"x21839",""
"x21839","Elinor placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to his"
"x21839","mother's account; and it was happy for her that he had a mother whose"
"x21839","character was so imperfectly known to her, as to be the general excuse"
"x21839","for every thing strange on the part of her son. Disappointed, however,"
"x21839","and vexed as she was, and sometimes displeased with his uncertain"
"x21839","behaviour to herself, she was very well disposed on the whole to"
"x21839","regard his actions with all the candid allowances and generous"
"x21839","qualifications, which had been rather more painfully extorted from"
"x21839","her, for Willoughby's service, by her mother. His want of spirits, of"
"x21839","openness, and of consistency, were most usually attributed to his want"
"x21839","of independence, and his better knowledge of Mrs. Ferrars's"
"x21839","disposition and designs. The shortness of his visit, the steadiness of"
"x21839","his purpose in leaving them, originated in the same fettered"
"x21839","inclination, the same inevitable necessity of temporizing with his"
"x21839","mother. The old well-established grievance of duty against will,"
"x21839","parent against child, was the cause of all. She would have been glad"
"x21839","to know when these difficulties were to cease, this opposition was to"
"x21839","yield, when Mrs. Ferrars would be reformed, and her son be at liberty"
"x21839","to be happy. But from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for"
"x21839","comfort to the renewal of her confidence in Edward's affection, to the"
"x21839","remembrance of every mark of regard in look or word which fell from"
"x21839","him while at Barton, and above all to that flattering proof of it"
"x21839","which he constantly wore round his finger."

"x21839","""I think, Edward,"" said Mrs. Dashwood, as they were at breakfast the"

"x21839","inconvenience to your friends, indeed, might result from it--you would"
"x21839","not be able to give them so much of your time. But (with a smile) you"

"x21839","know where to go when you left them."""

"x21839","engage me, no profession to give me employment, or afford me any thing"
"x21839","like independence. But unfortunately my own nicety, and the nicety of"
"x21839","my friends, have made me what I am, an idle, helpless being. We never"
"x21839","could agree in our choice of a profession. I always preferred the"
"x21839","church, as I still do. But that was not smart enough for my family."
"x21839","They recommended the army. That was a great deal too smart for me. The"
"x21839","law was allowed to be genteel enough; many young men, who had chambers"
"x21839","in the Temple, made a very good appearance in the first circles, and"
"x21839","drove about town in very knowing gigs. But I had no inclination for"
"x21839","the law, even in this less abstruse study of it, which my family"
"x21839","approved. As for the navy, it had fashion on its side, but I was too"
"x21839","old when the subject was first started to enter it; and, at length, as"
"x21839","there was no necessity for my having any profession at all, as I might"
"x21839","be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as with one,"
"x21839","idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous and"
"x21839","honourable, and a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly"
"x21839","bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his friends to do"
"x21839","nothing. I was therefore entered at Oxford and have been properly idle"
"x21839","ever since."""
"x21839",""

"x21839","But as it was her determination to subdue it, and to prevent herself"

"x21839","variety which the different state of her spirits at different times"
"x21839","could produce,--with tenderness, pity, approbation, censure, and"

"x21839","her mother and sisters, at least by the nature of their employments,"
"x21839","conversation was forbidden among them, and every effect of solitude"
"x21839","was produced. Her mind was inevitably at liberty; her thoughts could"

"x21839","However small Elinor's general dependence on Lucy's veracity might be,"
"x21839","it was impossible for her on serious reflection to suspect it in the"

"x21839","inventing a falsehood of such a description. What Lucy had asserted to"
"x21839","be true, therefore, Elinor could not, dared not longer doubt;"
"x21839","supported as it was too on every side by such probabilities and"
"x21839","proofs, and contradicted by nothing but her own wishes. Their"
"x21839","opportunity of acquaintance in the house of Mr. Pratt was a foundation"
"x21839","for the rest, at once indisputable and alarming; and Edward's visit"
"x21839","near Plymouth, his melancholy state of mind, his dissatisfaction at"

"x21839","intimate knowledge of the Miss Steeles as to Norland and their family"

"x21839","the ring, formed altogether such a body of evidence, as overcame"
"x21839","every fear of condemning him unfairly, and established as a fact,"
"x21839","which no partiality could set aside, his ill-treatment of herself. Her"
"x21839","resentment of such behaviour, her indignation at having been its dupe,"
"x21839","for a short time made her feel only for herself; but other ideas,"
"x21839","other considerations, soon arose. Had Edward been intentionally"
"x21839","deceiving her? Had he feigned a regard for her which he did not feel?"
"x21839","Was his engagement to Lucy an engagement of the heart? No; whatever it"
"x21839","might once have been, she could not believe it such at present. His"
"x21839","affection was all her own. She could not be deceived in that. Her"
"x21839","mother, sisters, Fanny, all had been conscious of his regard for her"
"x21839","at Norland; it was not an illusion of her own vanity. He certainly"
"x21839","loved her. What a softener of the heart was this persuasion! How much"
"x21839","could it not tempt her to forgive! He had been blamable, highly"
"x21839","blamable, in remaining at Norland after he first felt her influence"
"x21839","over him to be more than it ought to be. In that, he could not be"
"x21839","defended; but if he had injured her, how much more had he injured"
"x21839","himself; if her case were pitiable, his was hopeless. His imprudence"
"x21839","had made her miserable for a while; but it seemed to have deprived"
"x21839","himself of all chance of ever being otherwise. She might in time"
"x21839","regain tranquillity; but _he_, what had he to look forward to? Could"
"x21839","he ever be tolerably happy with Lucy Steele; could he, were his"
"x21839","affection for herself out of the question, with his integrity, his"

"x21839","The youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally blind him to"
"x21839","every thing but her beauty and good nature; but the four succeeding"
"x21839","years--years, which if rationally spent, give such improvement to the"
"x21839","understanding, must have opened his eyes to her defects of education,"
"x21839","while the same period of time, spent on her side in inferior society"

"x21839","expectations, that when she joined them at dinner only two hours after"
"x21839","she had first suffered the extinction of all her dearest hopes, no one"
"x21839","would have supposed from the appearance of the sisters, that Elinor"
"x21839","was mourning in secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever"

"x21839",""
"x21839","Much as she had suffered from her first conversation with Lucy on the"
"x21839","subject, she soon felt an earnest wish of renewing it; and this for"

"x21839","engagement repeated again, she wanted more clearly to understand what"
"x21839","Lucy really felt for Edward, whether there were any sincerity in her"
"x21839","declaration of tender regard for him, and she particularly wanted to"

"x21839","it than as a friend, which she very much feared her involuntary"
"x21839","agitation, in their morning discourse, must have left at least"
"x21839","doubtful. That Lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared very"
"x21839","probable: it was plain that Edward had always spoken highly in her"
"x21839","praise, not merely from Lucy's assertion, but from her venturing to"
"x21839","trust her on so short a personal acquaintance, with a secret so"
"x21839","confessedly and evidently important. And even Sir John's joking"
"x21839","intelligence must have had some weight. But indeed, while Elinor"
"x21839","remained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by"
"x21839","Edward, it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it"
"x21839","natural that Lucy should be jealous; and that she was so, her very"
"x21839","confidence was a proof. What other reason for the disclosure of the"
"x21839","affair could there be, but that Elinor might be informed by it of"
"x21839","Lucy's superior claims on Edward, and be taught to avoid him in"
"x21839","future? She had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her"
"x21839","rival's intentions, and while she was firmly resolved to act by her as"
"x21839","every principle of honour and honesty directed, to combat her own"
"x21839","affection for Edward and to see him as little as possible; she could"
"x21839","not deny herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince Lucy that her"
"x21839","heart was unwounded. And as she could now have nothing more painful to"
"x21839","hear on the subject than had already been told, she did not mistrust"

"x21839","Lady Middleton's head; and therefore very little leisure was ever"
"x21839","given for a general chat, and none at all for particular discourse."
"x21839","They met for the sake of eating, drinking, and laughing together,"

"x21839","After very little farther discourse, it was finally settled that the"

"x21839","delighted; for to a man, whose prevailing anxiety was the dread of"

"x21839","Elinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted her wishes with"

"x21839","beginning a journey to London under her protection, and as her guest,"
"x21839","without wondering at her own situation, so short had their"
"x21839","acquaintance with that lady been, so wholly unsuited were they in age"
"x21839","and disposition, and so many had been her objections against such a"
"x21839","measure only a few days before! But these objections had all, with"
"x21839","that happy ardour of youth which Marianne and her mother equally"
"x21839","shared, been overcome or overlooked; and Elinor, in spite of every"
"x21839","occasional doubt of Willoughby's constancy, could not witness the"
"x21839","rapture of delightful expectation which filled the whole soul and"
"x21839","beamed in the eyes of Marianne, without feeling how blank was her own"
"x21839","prospect, how cheerless her own state of mind in the comparison, and"
"x21839","how gladly she would engage in the solicitude of Marianne's situation"
"x21839","to have the same animating object in view, the same possibility of"
"x21839","hope. A short, a very short time however must now decide what"
"x21839","Willoughby's intentions were; in all probability he was already in"
"x21839","town. Marianne's eagerness to be gone declared her dependence on"
"x21839","finding him there; and Elinor was resolved not only upon gaining every"
"x21839","new light as to his character which her own observation or the"
"x21839","intelligence of others could give her, but likewise upon watching his"
"x21839","behaviour to her sister with such zealous attention, as to ascertain"
"x21839","what he was and what he meant, before many meetings had taken place."
"x21839","Should the result of her observations be unfavourable, she was"
"x21839","determined at all events to open the eyes of her sister; should it be"
"x21839","otherwise, her exertions would be of a different nature--she must then"
"x21839","learn to avoid every selfish comparison, and banish every regret which"
"x21839","might lessen her satisfaction in the happiness of Marianne."
"x21839",""
"x21839","They were three days on their journey, and Marianne's behaviour as"
"x21839","they travelled was a happy specimen of what future complaisance and"
"x21839","companionableness to Mrs. Jennings might be expected to be. She sat in"
"x21839","silence almost all the way, wrapt in her own meditations, and scarcely"
"x21839","ever voluntarily speaking, except when any object of picturesque"
"x21839","beauty within their view drew from her an exclamation of delight"
"x21839","exclusively addressed to her sister. To atone for this conduct"
"x21839","therefore, Elinor took immediate possession of the post of civility"
"x21839","which she had assigned herself, behaved with the greatest attention to"
"x21839","Mrs. Jennings, talked with her, laughed with her, and listened to her"
"x21839","whenever she could; and Mrs. Jennings on her side treated them both"
"x21839","with all possible kindness, was solicitous on every occasion for their"
"x21839","ease and enjoyment, and only disturbed that she could not make them"
"x21839","choose their own dinners at the inn, nor extort a confession of their"
"x21839","preferring salmon to cod, or boiled fowls to veal cutlets. They"
"x21839","reached town by three o'clock the third day, glad to be released,"
"x21839","after such a journey, from the confinement of a carriage, and ready to"
"x21839","enjoy all the luxury of a good fire."
"x21839",""
"x21839","The house was handsome, and handsomely fitted up, and the young"

"x21839",""
"x21839","As dinner was not to be ready in less than two hours from their"
"x21839","arrival, Elinor determined to employ the interval in writing to her"

"x21839","the same. ""I am writing home, Marianne,"" said Elinor; ""had not you"
"x21839","better defer your letter for a day or two?"""
"x21839",""
"x21839","""I am _not_ going to write to my mother,"" replied Marianne, hastily,"

"x21839","it immediately struck her that she must then be writing to Willoughby;"
"x21839","and the conclusion which as instantly followed was, that, however"
"x21839","mysteriously they might wish to conduct the affair, they must be"
"x21839","engaged. This conviction, though not entirely satisfactory, gave her"
"x21839","pleasure, and she continued her letter with greater alacrity."
"x21839","Marianne's was finished in a very few minutes; in length it could be"
"x21839","no more than a note; it was then folded up, sealed, and directed with"
"x21839","eager rapidity. Elinor thought she could distinguish a large W in the"
"x21839","direction; and no sooner was it complete than Marianne, ringing the"
"x21839","bell, requested the footman who answered it to get that letter"
"x21839","conveyed for her to the two-penny post. This decided the matter at"
"x21839","once."

"x21839","Her spirits still continued very high; but there was a flutter in them"

"x21839","dinner, and when they afterwards returned to the drawing room, seemed"
"x21839","anxiously listening to the sound of every carriage."

"x21839","It was a great satisfaction to Elinor that Mrs. Jennings, by being"
"x21839","much engaged in her own room, could see little of what was passing."
"x21839","The tea things were brought in, and already had Marianne been"
"x21839","disappointed more than once by a rap at a neighbouring door, when a"
"x21839","loud one was suddenly heard which could not be mistaken for one at any"
"x21839","other house, Elinor felt secure of its announcing Willoughby's"
"x21839","approach, and Marianne, starting up, moved towards the door. Every"
"x21839","thing was silent; this could not be borne many seconds; she opened"
"x21839","the door, advanced a few steps towards the stairs, and after listening"
"x21839","half a minute, returned into the room in all the agitation which a"
"x21839","conviction of having heard him would naturally produce; in the ecstasy"
"x21839","of her feelings at that instant she could not help exclaiming, ""Oh,"
"x21839","Elinor, it is Willoughby, indeed it is!"" and seemed almost ready to"
"x21839","throw herself into his arms, when Colonel Brandon appeared."
"x21839",""
"x21839","It was too great a shock to be borne with calmness, and she"
"x21839","immediately left the room. Elinor was disappointed too; but at the"
"x21839","same time her regard for Colonel Brandon ensured his welcome with her;"
"x21839","and she felt particularly hurt that a man so partial to her sister"
"x21839","should perceive that she experienced nothing but grief and"
"x21839","disappointment in seeing him. She instantly saw that it was not"
"x21839","unnoticed by him, that he even observed Marianne as she quitted the"
"x21839","room, with such astonishment and concern, as hardly left him the"
"x21839","recollection of what civility demanded towards herself."

"x21839","Willoughby were then in town, but she was afraid of giving him pain by"
"x21839","any enquiry after his rival; and at length, by way of saying"
"x21839","something, she asked if he had been in London ever since she had seen"
"x21839","him last. ""Yes,"" he replied, with some embarrassment, ""almost ever"

"x21839","Willoughby to be as unfortunate and as innocent as herself, and at"
"x21839","others, lost every consolation in the impossibility of acquitting him."
"x21839","At one moment she was absolutely indifferent to the observation of all"
"x21839","the world, at another she would seclude herself from it for ever, and"
"x21839","at a third could resist it with energy. In one thing, however, she"
"x21839","was uniform, when it came to the point, in avoiding, where it was"
"x21839","possible, the presence of Mrs. Jennings, and in a determined silence"
"x21839","when obliged to endure it. Her heart was hardened against the belief"

"x21839","orphan from her infancy, and under the guardianship of my father. Our"
"x21839","ages were nearly the same, and from our earliest years we were"
"x21839","playfellows and friends. I cannot remember the time when I did not"

"x21839","seventeen she was lost to me for ever. She was married--married"
"x21839","against her inclination to my brother. Her fortune was large, and our"
"x21839","family estate much encumbered. And this, I fear, is all that can be"

"x21839","eloping together for Scotland. The treachery, or the folly, of my"
"x21839","cousin's maid betrayed us. I was banished to the house of a relation"
"x21839","far distant, and she was allowed no liberty, no society, no amusement,"
"x21839","till my father's point was gained. I had depended on her fortitude too"

"x21839","so young as I then was, a few months must have reconciled me to it,"
"x21839","or at least I should not have now to lament it. This however was not"
"x21839","the case. My brother had no regard for her; his pleasures were not"
"x21839","what they ought to have been, and from the first he treated her"
"x21839","unkindly. The consequence of this, upon a mind so young, so lively, so"
"x21839","inexperienced as Mrs. Brandon's, was but too natural. She resigned"

"x21839",""
"x21839",""
"x21839","Within a few days after this meeting, the newspapers announced to the"
"x21839","world, that the lady of Thomas Palmer, Esq. was safely delivered of a"
"x21839","son and heir; a very interesting and satisfactory paragraph, at least"
"x21839","to all those intimate connections who knew it before."
"x21839",""
"x21839","This event, highly important to Mrs. Jennings's happiness, produced a"
"x21839","temporary alteration in the disposal of her time, and influenced, in a"
"x21839","like degree, the engagements of her young friends; for as she wished"
"x21839","to be as much as possible with Charlotte, she went thither every"
"x21839","morning as soon as she was dressed, and did not return till late in"
"x21839","the evening; and the Miss Dashwoods, at the particular request of the"
"x21839","Middletons, spent the whole of every day, in Conduit Street. For their"
"x21839","own comfort they would much rather have remained, at least all the"
"x21839","morning, in Mrs. Jennings's house; but it was not a thing to be urged"
"x21839","against the wishes of everybody. Their hours were therefore made over"
"x21839","to Lady Middleton and the two Miss Steeles, by whom their company, in"
"x21839","fact was as little valued, as it was professedly sought."
"x21839",""
"x21839","They had too much sense to be desirable companions to the former; and"
"x21839","by the latter they were considered with a jealous eye, as intruding on"
"x21839","_their_ ground, and sharing the kindness which they wanted to"
"x21839","monopolize. Though nothing could be more polite than Lady Middleton's"
"x21839","behaviour to Elinor and Marianne, she did not really like them at all."
"x21839","Because they neither flattered herself nor her children, she could not"
"x21839","believe them good-natured; and because they were fond of reading, she"
"x21839","fancied them satirical: perhaps without exactly knowing what it was to"
"x21839","be satirical; but _that_ did not signify. It was censure in common"
"x21839","use, and easily given."
"x21839",""
"x21839","Their presence was a restraint both on her and on Lucy. It checked the"
"x21839","idleness of one, and the business of the other. Lady Middleton was"
"x21839","ashamed of doing nothing before them, and the flattery which Lucy was"
"x21839","proud to think of and administer at other times, she feared they would"
"x21839","despise her for offering. Miss Steele was the least discomposed of the"
"x21839","three, by their presence; and it was in their power to reconcile her"
"x21839","to it entirely. Would either of them only have given her a full and"
"x21839","minute account of the whole affair between Marianne and Mr."
"x21839","Willoughby, she would have thought herself amply rewarded for the"
"x21839","sacrifice of the best place by the fire after dinner, which their"
"x21839","arrival occasioned. But this conciliation was not granted; for though"
"x21839","she often threw out expressions of pity for her sister to Elinor, and"
"x21839","more than once dropt a reflection on the inconstancy of beaux before"
"x21839","Marianne, no effect was produced, but a look of indifference from the"
"x21839","former, or of disgust in the latter. An effort even yet lighter might"
"x21839","have made her their friend. Would they only have laughed at her about"
"x21839","the Doctor! But so little were they, anymore than the others, inclined"
"x21839","to oblige her, that if Sir John dined from home, she might spend a"
"x21839","whole day without hearing any other raillery on the subject, than what"
"x21839","she was kind enough to bestow on herself."
"x21839",""
"x21839","All these jealousies and discontents, however, were so totally"
"x21839","unsuspected by Mrs. Jennings, that she thought it a delightful thing"
"x21839","for the girls to be together; and generally congratulated her young"
"x21839","friends every night, on having escaped the company of a stupid old"
"x21839","woman so long. She joined them sometimes at Sir John's, sometimes at"
"x21839","her own house; but wherever it was, she always came in excellent"
"x21839","spirits, full of delight and importance, attributing Charlotte's well"
"x21839","doing to her own care, and ready to give so exact, so minute a detail"
"x21839","of her situation, as only Miss Steele had curiosity enough to desire."
"x21839","One thing _did_ disturb her; and of that she made her daily complaint."
"x21839","Mr. Palmer maintained the common, but unfatherly opinion among his"
"x21839","sex, of all infants being alike; and though she could plainly"
"x21839","perceive, at different times, the most striking resemblance between"
"x21839","this baby and every one of his relations on both sides, there was no"
"x21839","convincing his father of it; no persuading him to believe that it was"
"x21839","not exactly like every other baby of the same age; nor could he even"
"x21839","be brought to acknowledge the simple proposition of its being the"
"x21839","finest child in the world."
"x21839",""
"x21839","I come now to the relation of a misfortune, which about this time"
"x21839","befell Mrs. John Dashwood. It so happened that while her two sisters"
"x21839","with Mrs. Jennings were first calling on her in Harley Street, another"
"x21839","of her acquaintance had dropt in--a circumstance in itself not"
"x21839","apparently likely to produce evil to her. But while the imaginations"
"x21839","of other people will carry them away to form wrong judgments of our"
"x21839","conduct, and to decide on it by slight appearances, one's happiness"
"x21839","must in some measure be always at the mercy of chance. In the present"
"x21839","instance, this last-arrived lady allowed her fancy to so far outrun"
"x21839","truth and probability, that on merely hearing the name of the Miss"
"x21839","Dashwoods, and understanding them to be Mr. Dashwood's sisters, she"
"x21839","immediately concluded them to be staying in Harley Street; and this"
"x21839","misconstruction produced within a day or two afterwards, cards of"
"x21839","invitation for them as well as for their brother and sister, to a"
"x21839","small musical party at her house. The consequence of which was, that"
"x21839","Mrs. John Dashwood was obliged to submit not only to the exceedingly"
"x21839","great inconvenience of sending her carriage for the Miss Dashwoods,"
"x21839","but, what was still worse, must be subject to all the unpleasantness"
"x21839","of appearing to treat them with attention: and who could tell that"
"x21839","they might not expect to go out with her a second time? The power of"
"x21839","disappointing them, it was true, must always be her's. But that was"
"x21839","not enough; for when people are determined on a mode of conduct which"
"x21839","they know to be wrong, they feel injured by the expectation of any"
"x21839","thing better from them."

"x21839","Marianne had now been brought by degrees, so much into the habit of"
"x21839","going out every day, that it was become a matter of indifference to"
"x21839","her, whether she went or not: and she prepared quietly and"
"x21839","mechanically for every evening's engagement, though without expecting"

"x21839","of their being together, when it was finished. Nothing escaped _her_"
"x21839","minute observation and general curiosity; she saw every thing, and"
"x21839","asked every thing; was never easy till she knew the price of every"
"x21839","part of Marianne's dress; could have guessed the number of her gowns"
"x21839","altogether with better judgment than Marianne herself, and was not"
"x21839","without hopes of finding out before they parted, how much her washing"
"x21839","cost per week, and how much she had every year to spend upon herself."
"x21839","The impertinence of these kind of scrutinies, moreover, was generally"
"x21839","concluded with a compliment, which though meant as its douceur, was"
"x21839","considered by Marianne as the greatest impertinence of all; for after"
"x21839","undergoing an examination into the value and make of her gown, the"
"x21839","colour of her shoes, and the arrangement of her hair, she was almost"
"x21839","sure of being told that upon ""her word she looked vastly smart, and"

"x21839","had--assisted by the still greater imprudence of sitting in her wet"
"x21839","shoes and stockings--given Marianne a cold so violent as, though for a"
"x21839","day or two trifled with or denied, would force itself by increasing"
"x21839","ailments on the concern of every body, and the notice of herself."
"x21839","Prescriptions poured in from all quarters, and as usual, were all"
"x21839","declined. Though heavy and feverish, with a pain in her limbs, and a"
"x21839","cough, and a sore throat, a good night's rest was to cure her"
"x21839","entirely; and it was with difficulty that Elinor prevailed on her,"
"x21839","when she went to bed, to try one or two of the simplest of the"
"x21839","remedies."

"x21839",""
"x21839",""
"x21839","Marianne got up the next morning at her usual time; to every inquiry"
"x21839","replied that she was better, and tried to prove herself so, by"
"x21839","engaging in her accustomary employments. But a day spent in sitting"
"x21839","shivering over the fire with a book in her hand, which she was unable"
"x21839","to read, or in lying, weary and languid, on a sofa, did not speak much"
"x21839","in favour of her amendment; and when, at last, she went early to bed,"
"x21839","more and more indisposed, Colonel Brandon was only astonished at her"
"x21839","sister's composure, who, though attending and nursing her the whole"
"x21839","day, against Marianne's inclination, and forcing proper medicines on"
"x21839","her at night, trusted, like Marianne, to the certainty and efficacy of"
"x21839","sleep, and felt no real alarm."
"x21839",""
"x21839","A very restless and feverish night, however, disappointed the"
"x21839","expectation of both; and when Marianne, after persisting in rising,"
"x21839","confessed herself unable to sit up, and returned voluntarily to her"
"x21839","bed, Elinor was very ready to adopt Mrs. Jennings's advice, of sending"
"x21839","for the Palmers' apothecary."
"x21839",""
"x21839","He came, examined his patient, and though encouraging Miss Dashwood to"
"x21839","expect that a very few days would restore her sister to health, yet,"
"x21839","by pronouncing her disorder to have a putrid tendency, and allowing"
"x21839","the word ""infection"" to pass his lips, gave instant alarm to Mrs."
"x21839","Palmer, on her baby's account. Mrs. Jennings, who had been inclined"
"x21839","from the first to think Marianne's complaint more serious than Elinor,"
"x21839","now looked very grave on Mr. Harris's report, and confirming"
"x21839","Charlotte's fears and caution, urged the necessity of her immediate"
"x21839","removal with her infant; and Mr. Palmer, though treating their"
"x21839","apprehensions as idle, found the anxiety and importunity of his wife"
"x21839","too great to be withstood. Her departure, therefore, was fixed on; and"
"x21839","within an hour after Mr. Harris's arrival, she set off, with her"
"x21839","little boy and his nurse, for the house of a near relation of Mr."
"x21839","Palmer's, who lived a few miles on the other side of Bath; whither her"
"x21839","husband promised, at her earnest entreaty, to join her in a day or"
"x21839","two; and whither she was almost equally urgent with her mother to"
"x21839","accompany her. Mrs. Jennings, however, with a kindness of heart which"
"x21839","made Elinor really love her, declared her resolution of not stirring"
"x21839","from Cleveland as long as Marianne remained ill, and of endeavouring,"
"x21839","by her own attentive care, to supply to her the place of the mother"
"x21839","she had taken her from; and Elinor found her on every occasion a most"
"x21839","willing and active helpmate, desirous to share in all her fatigues,"
"x21839","and often by her better experience in nursing, of material use."
"x21839",""
"x21839","Poor Marianne, languid and low from the nature of her malady, and"
"x21839","feeling herself universally ill, could no longer hope that tomorrow"
"x21839","would find her recovered; and the idea of what tomorrow would have"
"x21839","produced, but for this unlucky illness, made every ailment severe; for"
"x21839","on that day they were to have begun their journey home; and, attended"
"x21839","the whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings, were to have taken their"
"x21839","mother by surprise on the following forenoon. The little she said was"
"x21839","all in lamentation of this inevitable delay; though Elinor tried to"
"x21839","raise her spirits, and make her believe, as she _then_ really believed"
"x21839","herself, that it would be a very short one."
"x21839",""
"x21839","The next day produced little or no alteration in the state of the"
"x21839","patient; she certainly was not better, and, except that there was no"
"x21839","amendment, did not appear worse. Their party was now farther reduced;"
"x21839","for Mr. Palmer, though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity"
"x21839","and good-nature, as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened away"
"x21839","by his wife, was persuaded at last by Colonel Brandon to perform his"
"x21839","promise of following her; and while he was preparing to go, Colonel"
"x21839","Brandon himself, with a much greater exertion, began to talk of going"
"x21839","likewise. Here, however, the kindness of Mrs. Jennings interposed most"
"x21839","acceptably; for to send the Colonel away while his love was in so much"
"x21839","uneasiness on her sister's account, would be to deprive them both, she"
"x21839","thought, of every comfort; and therefore telling him at once that his"
"x21839","stay at Cleveland was necessary to herself, that she should want him"
"x21839","to play at piquet of an evening, while Miss Dashwood was above with"
"x21839","her sister, &c. she urged him so strongly to remain, that he, who was"
"x21839","gratifying the first wish of his own heart by a compliance, could not"
"x21839","long even affect to demur; especially as Mrs. Jennings's entreaty was"
"x21839","warmly seconded by Mr. Palmer, who seemed to feel a relief to himself,"
"x21839","in leaving behind him a person so well able to assist or advise Miss"
"x21839","Dashwood in any emergence."
"x21839",""
"x21839","Marianne was, of course, kept in ignorance of all these arrangements."
"x21839","She knew not that she had been the means of sending the owners of"
"x21839","Cleveland away, in about seven days from the time of their arrival. It"
"x21839","gave her no surprise that she saw nothing of Mrs. Palmer; and as it"
"x21839","gave her likewise no concern, she never mentioned her name."
"x21839",""
"x21839","Two days passed away from the time of Mr. Palmer's departure, and her"
"x21839","situation continued, with little variation, the same. Mr. Harris, who"
"x21839","attended her every day, still talked boldly of a speedy recovery, and"
"x21839","Miss Dashwood was equally sanguine; but the expectation of the others"
"x21839","was by no means so cheerful. Mrs. Jennings had determined very early"
"x21839","in the seizure that Marianne would never get over it, and Colonel"
"x21839","Brandon, who was chiefly of use in listening to Mrs. Jennings's"
"x21839","forebodings, was not in a state of mind to resist their influence. He"
"x21839","tried to reason himself out of fears, which the different judgment of"
"x21839","the apothecary seemed to render absurd; but the many hours of each day"
"x21839","in which he was left entirely alone, were but too favourable for the"
"x21839","admission of every melancholy idea, and he could not expel from his"
"x21839","mind the persuasion that he should see Marianne no more."
"x21839",""
"x21839","On the morning of the third day however, the gloomy anticipations of"
"x21839","both were almost done away; for when Mr. Harris arrived, he declared"
"x21839","his patient materially better. Her pulse was much stronger, and every"
"x21839","symptom more favourable than on the preceding visit. Elinor, confirmed"
"x21839","in every pleasant hope, was all cheerfulness; rejoicing that in her"
"x21839","letters to her mother, she had pursued her own judgment rather than"
"x21839","her friend's, in making very light of the indisposition which delayed"
"x21839","them at Cleveland; and almost fixing on the time when Marianne would"
"x21839","be able to travel."
"x21839",""
"x21839","But the day did not close so auspiciously as it began. Towards the"
"x21839","evening Marianne became ill again, growing more heavy, restless, and"
"x21839","uncomfortable than before. Her sister, however, still sanguine, was"
"x21839","willing to attribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue of"
"x21839","having sat up to have her bed made; and carefully administering the"
"x21839","cordials prescribed, saw her, with satisfaction, sink at last into a"
"x21839","slumber, from which she expected the most beneficial effects. Her"
"x21839","sleep, though not so quiet as Elinor wished to see it, lasted a"
"x21839","considerable time; and anxious to observe the result of it herself,"
"x21839","she resolved to sit with her during the whole of it. Mrs. Jennings,"
"x21839","knowing nothing of any change in the patient, went unusually early to"
"x21839","bed; her maid, who was one of the principal nurses, was recreating"
"x21839","herself in the housekeeper's room, and Elinor remained alone with"
"x21839","Marianne."
"x21839",""
"x21839","The repose of the latter became more and more disturbed; and her"
"x21839","sister, who watched, with unremitting attention her continual change"
"x21839","of posture, and heard the frequent but inarticulate sounds of"
"x21839","complaint which passed her lips, was almost wishing to rouse her from"
"x21839","so painful a slumber, when Marianne, suddenly awakened by some"
"x21839","accidental noise in the house, started hastily up, and, with feverish"
"x21839","wildness, cried out,--"
"x21839",""
"x21839","""Is mama coming?--"""
"x21839",""
"x21839","""Not yet,"" cried the other, concealing her terror, and assisting"
"x21839","Marianne to lie down again, ""but she will be here, I hope, before it"
"x21839","is long. It is a great way, you know, from hence to Barton."""
"x21839",""
"x21839","""But she must not go round by London,"" cried Marianne, in the same"
"x21839","hurried manner. ""I shall never see her, if she goes by London."""
"x21839",""
"x21839","Elinor perceived with alarm that she was not quite herself, and, while"
"x21839","attempting to soothe her, eagerly felt her pulse. It was lower and"
"x21839","quicker than ever! and Marianne, still talking wildly of mama, her"
"x21839","alarm increased so rapidly, as to determine her on sending instantly"
"x21839","for Mr. Harris, and despatching a messenger to Barton for her mother."
"x21839","To consult with Colonel Brandon on the best means of effecting the"
"x21839","latter, was a thought which immediately followed the resolution of its"
"x21839","performance; and as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place by"
"x21839","her sister, she hastened down to the drawing-room, where she knew he"
"x21839","was generally to be found at a much later hour than the present."
"x21839",""
"x21839","It was no time for hesitation. Her fears and her difficulties were"
"x21839","immediately before him. Her fears, he had no courage, no confidence to"
"x21839","attempt the removal of; he listened to them in silent despondence; but"
"x21839","her difficulties were instantly obviated, for with a readiness that"
"x21839","seemed to speak the occasion, and the service pre-arranged in his"
"x21839","mind, he offered himself as the messenger who should fetch Mrs."
"x21839","Dashwood. Elinor made no resistance that was not easily overcome. She"
"x21839","thanked him with brief, though fervent gratitude, and while he went to"
"x21839","hurry off his servant with a message to Mr. Harris, and an order for"
"x21839","post-horses directly, she wrote a few lines to her mother."
"x21839",""
"x21839","The comfort of such a friend at that moment as Colonel Brandon--or"
"x21839","such a companion for her mother,--how gratefully was it felt!--a"
"x21839","companion whose judgment would guide, whose attendance must relieve,"
"x21839","and whose friendship might soothe her!--as far as the shock of such a"
"x21839","summons _could_ be lessened to her, his presence, his manners, his"
"x21839","assistance, would lessen it."
"x21839",""
"x21839","_He_, meanwhile, whatever he might feel, acted with all the firmness"
"x21839","of a collected mind, made every necessary arrangement with the utmost"
"x21839","despatch, and calculated with exactness the time in which she might"
"x21839","look for his return. Not a moment was lost in delay of any kind. The"
"x21839","horses arrived, even before they were expected, and Colonel Brandon"
"x21839","only pressing her hand with a look of solemnity, and a few words"
"x21839","spoken too low to reach her ear, hurried into the carriage. It was"
"x21839","then about twelve o'clock, and she returned to her sister's apartment"
"x21839","to wait for the arrival of the apothecary, and to watch by her the"
"x21839","rest of the night. It was a night of almost equal suffering to both."
"x21839","Hour after hour passed away in sleepless pain and delirium on"
"x21839","Marianne's side, and in the most cruel anxiety on Elinor's, before Mr."
"x21839","Harris appeared. Her apprehensions once raised, paid by their excess"
"x21839","for all her former security; and the servant who sat up with her, for"
"x21839","she would not allow Mrs. Jennings to be called, only tortured her"
"x21839","more, by hints of what her mistress had always thought."
"x21839",""
"x21839","Marianne's ideas were still, at intervals, fixed incoherently on her"
"x21839","mother, and whenever she mentioned her name, it gave a pang to the"
"x21839","heart of poor Elinor, who, reproaching herself for having trifled with"
"x21839","so many days of illness, and wretched for some immediate relief,"
"x21839","fancied that all relief might soon be in vain, that every thing had"
"x21839","been delayed too long, and pictured to herself her suffering mother"
"x21839","arriving too late to see this darling child, or to see her rational."
"x21839",""
"x21839","She was on the point of sending again for Mr. Harris, or if _he_ could"
"x21839","not come, for some other advice, when the former--but not till after"
"x21839","five o'clock--arrived. His opinion, however, made some little amends"
"x21839","for his delay, for though acknowledging a very unexpected and"
"x21839","unpleasant alteration in his patient, he would not allow the danger to"
"x21839","be material, and talked of the relief which a fresh mode of treatment"
"x21839","must procure, with a confidence which, in a lesser degree, was"
"x21839","communicated to Elinor. He promised to call again in the course of"
"x21839","three or four hours, and left both the patient and her anxious"
"x21839","attendant more composed than he had found them."
"x21839",""
"x21839","With strong concern, and with many reproaches for not being called to"
"x21839","their aid, did Mrs. Jennings hear in the morning of what had passed."
"x21839","Her former apprehensions, now with greater reason restored, left her"
"x21839","no doubt of the event; and though trying to speak comfort to Elinor,"
"x21839","her conviction of her sister's danger would not allow her to offer the"
"x21839","comfort of hope. Her heart was really grieved. The rapid decay, the"
"x21839","early death of a girl so young, so lovely as Marianne, must have"
"x21839","struck a less interested person with concern. On Mrs. Jennings's"
"x21839","compassion she had other claims. She had been for three months her"
"x21839","companion, was still under her care, and she was known to have been"
"x21839","greatly injured, and long unhappy. The distress of her sister too,"
"x21839","particularly a favourite, was before her;--and as for their mother,"
"x21839","when Mrs. Jennings considered that Marianne might probably be to _her_"
"x21839","what Charlotte was to herself, her sympathy in _her_ sufferings was"
"x21839","very sincere."
"x21839",""
"x21839","Mr. Harris was punctual in his second visit; but he came to be"
"x21839","disappointed in his hopes of what the last would produce. His"
"x21839","medicines had failed; the fever was unabated; and Marianne only more"
"x21839","quiet--not more herself--remained in a heavy stupor. Elinor, catching"
"x21839","all, and more than all, his fears in a moment, proposed to call in"
"x21839","further advice. But he judged it unnecessary: he had still something"
"x21839","more to try, some more fresh application, of whose success he was as"
"x21839","confident as the last, and his visit concluded with encouraging"
"x21839","assurances which reached the ear, but could not enter the heart of"
"x21839","Miss Dashwood. She was calm, except when she thought of her mother;"
"x21839","but she was almost hopeless; and in this state she continued till"
"x21839","noon, scarcely stirring from her sister's bed, her thoughts wandering"
"x21839","from one image of grief, one suffering friend to another, and her"
"x21839","spirits oppressed to the utmost by the conversation of Mrs. Jennings,"
"x21839","who scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger of this attack"
"x21839","to the many weeks of previous indisposition which Marianne's"
"x21839","disappointment had brought on. Elinor felt all the reasonableness of"
"x21839","the idea, and it gave fresh misery to her reflections."
"x21839",""
"x21839","About noon, however, she began--but with a caution--a dread of"
"x21839","disappointment which for some time kept her silent, even to her"
"x21839","friend--to fancy, to hope she could perceive a slight amendment in her"
"x21839","sister's pulse; she waited, watched, and examined it again and again;"
"x21839","and at last, with an agitation more difficult to bury under exterior"
"x21839","calmness, than all her foregoing distress, ventured to communicate her"
"x21839","hopes. Mrs. Jennings, though forced, on examination, to acknowledge a"
"x21839","temporary revival, tried to keep her young friend from indulging a"
"x21839","thought of its continuance; and Elinor, conning over every injunction"
"x21839","of distrust, told herself likewise not to hope. But it was too late."
"x21839","Hope had already entered; and feeling all its anxious flutter, she"
"x21839","bent over her sister to watch--she hardly knew for what. Half an hour"
"x21839","passed away, and the favourable symptom yet blessed her. Others even"
"x21839","arose to confirm it. Her breath, her skin, her lips, all flattered"
"x21839","Elinor with signs of amendment; and Marianne fixed her eyes on her"
"x21839","with a rational, though languid, gaze. Anxiety and hope now oppressed"
"x21839","her in equal degrees, and left her no moment of tranquillity till the"
"x21839","arrival of Mr. Harris at four o'clock; when his assurances, his"
"x21839","felicitations on a recovery in her sister even surpassing his"
"x21839","expectation, gave her confidence, comfort, and tears of joy."
"x21839",""
"x21839","Marianne was in every respect materially better, and he declared her"
"x21839","entirely out of danger. Mrs. Jennings, perhaps satisfied with the"
"x21839","partial justification of her forebodings which had been found in their"
"x21839","late alarm, allowed herself to trust in his judgment, and admitted,"
"x21839","with unfeigned joy, and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness, the"
"x21839","probability of an entire recovery."
"x21839",""
"x21839","Elinor could not be cheerful. Her joy was of a different kind, and led"
"x21839","to any thing rather than to gaiety. Marianne restored to life, health,"
"x21839","friends, and to her doting mother, was an idea to fill her heart with"
"x21839","sensations of exquisite comfort, and expand it in fervent"
"x21839","gratitude;--but it lead to no outward demonstrations of joy, no words,"
"x21839","no smiles. All within Elinor's breast was satisfaction, silent and"
"x21839","strong."
"x21839",""
"x21839","She continued by the side of her sister, with little intermission the"
"x21839","whole afternoon, calming every fear, satisfying every inquiry of her"
"x21839","enfeebled spirits, supplying every succour, and watching almost every"
"x21839","look and every breath. The possibility of a relapse would of course,"
"x21839","in some moments, occur to remind her of what anxiety was; but when she"
"x21839","saw, on her frequent and minute examination, that every symptom of"
"x21839","recovery continued, and saw Marianne at six o'clock sink into a quiet,"
"x21839","steady, and to all appearance comfortable, sleep, she silenced every"
"x21839","doubt."
"x21839",""
"x21839","The time was now drawing on, when Colonel Brandon might be expected"
"x21839","back. At ten o'clock, she trusted, or at least not much later her"
"x21839","mother would be relieved from the dreadful suspense in which she must"
"x21839","now be travelling towards them. The Colonel, too!--perhaps scarcely"
"x21839","less an object of pity! Oh! how slow was the progress of time which"
"x21839","yet kept them in ignorance!"
"x21839",""
"x21839","At seven o'clock, leaving Marianne still sweetly asleep, she joined"
"x21839","Mrs. Jennings in the drawing-room to tea. Of breakfast she had been"
"x21839","kept by her fears, and of dinner by their sudden reverse, from eating"
"x21839","much; and the present refreshment, therefore, with such feelings of"
"x21839","content as she brought to it, was particularly welcome. Mrs. Jennings"
"x21839","would have persuaded her, at its conclusion, to take some rest before"
"x21839","her mother's arrival, and allow _her_ to take her place by Marianne;"
"x21839","but Elinor had no sense of fatigue, no capability of sleep at that"
"x21839","moment about her, and she was not to be kept away from her sister an"
"x21839","unnecessary instant. Mrs. Jennings therefore attending her up stairs"
"x21839","into the sick chamber, to satisfy herself that all continued right,"
"x21839","left her there again to her charge and her thoughts, and retired to"
"x21839","her own room to write letters and sleep."
"x21839",""
"x21839","The night was cold and stormy. The wind roared round the house, and"
"x21839","the rain beat against the windows; but Elinor, all happiness within,"
"x21839","regarded it not. Marianne slept through every blast; and the"
"x21839","travellers, they had a rich reward in store, for every present"
"x21839","inconvenience."
"x21839",""
"x21839","The clock struck eight. Had it been ten, Elinor would have been"
"x21839","convinced that at that moment she heard a carriage driving up to the"
"x21839","house; and so strong was the persuasion that she _did_, in spite of"
"x21839","the _almost_ impossibility of their being already come, that she moved"
"x21839","into the adjoining dressing-closet and opened a window shutter, to be"
"x21839","satisfied of the truth. She instantly saw that her ears had not"
"x21839","deceived her. The flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately in"
"x21839","view. By their uncertain light she thought she could discern it to be"
"x21839","drawn by four horses; and this, while it told the excess of her poor"
"x21839","mother's alarm, gave some explanation to such unexpected rapidity."
"x21839",""
"x21839","Never in her life had Elinor found it so difficult to be calm, as at"
"x21839","that moment. The knowledge of what her mother must be feeling as the"
"x21839","carriage stopped the door,--of her doubt--her dread,--perhaps her"
"x21839","despair!--and of what _she_ had to tell! with such knowledge it was"
"x21839","impossible to be calm. All that remained to be done was to be speedy;"
"x21839","and, therefore staying only till she could leave Mrs. Jennings's maid"
"x21839","with her sister, she hurried down stairs."
"x21839",""
"x21839","The bustle in the vestibule, as she passed along an inner lobby,"
"x21839","assured her that they were already in the house. She rushed to the"

"x21839","meditated, because I did not _then_ know what it was to love. But have"

"x21839","comparative poverty, which her affection and her society would have"
"x21839","deprived of all its horrors, I have, by raising myself to affluence,"
"x21839","lost every thing that could make it a blessing."""

"x21839","Is there a man on earth who could have done it? Yes, I found myself,"
"x21839","by insensible degrees, sincerely fond of her; and the happiest hours"
"x21839","of my life were what I spent with her when I felt my intentions were"
"x21839","strictly honourable, and my feelings blameless. Even _then_, however,"
"x21839","when fully determined on paying my addresses to her, I allowed myself"
"x21839","most improperly to put off, from day to day, the moment of doing it,"
"x21839","from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement while my"
"x21839","circumstances were so greatly embarrassed. I will not reason here--nor"
"x21839","will I stop for _you_ to expatiate on the absurdity, and the worse"
"x21839","than absurdity, of scrupling to engage my faith where my honour was"
"x21839","already bound. The event has proved, that I was a cunning fool,"
"x21839","providing with great circumspection for a possible opportunity of"
"x21839","making myself contemptible and wretched for ever. At last, however, my"
"x21839","resolution was taken, and I had determined, as soon as I could engage"
"x21839","her alone, to justify the attentions I had so invariably paid her, and"
"x21839","openly assure her of an affection which I had already taken such pains"
"x21839","to display. But in the interim--in the interim of the very few hours"
"x21839","that were to pass, before I could have an opportunity of speaking with"

"x21839","confess is beyond my comprehension."""
"x21839",""
"x21839","""Remember,"" cried Willoughby, ""from whom you received the account."
"x21839","Could it be an impartial one? I acknowledge that her situation and her"
"x21839","character ought to have been respected by me. I do not mean to justify"
"x21839","myself, but at the same time cannot leave you to suppose that I have"
"x21839","nothing to urge--that because she was injured she was irreproachable,"

"x21839","violence of her passions, the weakness of her understanding--I do not"

"x21839","tenderness which, for a very short time, had the power of creating any"

"x21839","more than herself; and I have injured one, whose affection for"

"x21839","mind--Oh! how infinitely superior!"""
"x21839",""
"x21839","""Your indifference, however, towards that unfortunate girl--I must say"
"x21839","it, unpleasant to me as the discussion of such a subject may well"

"x21839","not think yourself excused by any weakness, any natural defect of"
"x21839","understanding on her side, in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours."
"x21839","You must have known, that while you were enjoying yourself in"

"x21839","""But, upon my soul, I did _not_ know it,"" he warmly replied; ""I did"

"x21839",""
"x21839","""Well, sir, and what said Mrs. Smith?"""
"x21839",""
"x21839","""She taxed me with the offence at once, and my confusion may be"
"x21839","guessed. The purity of her life, the formality of her notions, her"
"x21839","ignorance of the world,--every thing was against me. The matter itself"
"x21839","I could not deny, and vain was every endeavour to soften it. She was"
"x21839","previously disposed, I believe, to doubt the morality of my conduct in"
"x21839","general, and was moreover discontented with the very little attention,"
"x21839","the very little portion of my time that I had bestowed on her, in my"
"x21839","present visit. In short, it ended in a total breach. By one measure I"
"x21839","might have saved myself. In the height of her morality, good woman!"
"x21839","she offered to forgive the past, if I would marry Eliza. That could"
"x21839","not be; and I was formally dismissed from her favour and her house."
"x21839","The night following this affair--I was to go the next morning--was"
"x21839","spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be. The"
"x21839","struggle was great, but it ended too soon. My affection for Marianne,"
"x21839","my thorough conviction of her attachment to me--it was all"
"x21839","insufficient to outweigh that dread of poverty, or get the better of"
"x21839","those false ideas of the necessity of riches, which I was naturally"
"x21839","inclined to feel, and expensive society had increased. I had reason to"
"x21839","believe myself secure of my present wife, if I chose to address her,"
"x21839","and I persuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence"
"x21839","remained for me to do. A heavy scene however awaited me, before I"
"x21839","could leave Devonshire: I was engaged to dine with you on that very"
"x21839","day; some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking this"
"x21839","engagement. But whether I should write this apology, or deliver it in"
"x21839","person, was a point of long debate. To see Marianne, I felt, would be"
"x21839","dreadful, and I even doubted whether I could see her again, and keep"
"x21839","to my resolution. In that point, however, I undervalued my own"
"x21839","magnanimity, as the event declared; for I went, I saw her, and saw her"
"x21839","miserable, and left her miserable;--and left her hoping never to see"

"x21839","brother. He was proud of his conquest, proud of tricking Edward, and"
"x21839","very proud of marrying privately without his mother's consent. What"

"x42671","compatible with the profession of a clergyman.--I do not mean however to"
"x42671","assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to"
"x42671","music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The"
"x42671","rector of a parish has much to do.--In the first place, he must make"
"x42671","such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not"
"x42671","offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time"
"x42671","that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care"

"x42671","her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and"

"x42671","advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond any"

"x42671","the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had"

"x42671","the chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline"
"x42671","boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict"
"x42671","the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former"
"x42671","letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an"
"x42671","inmate of Mr. Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures, some plans of"
"x42671","the latter with regard to new furniture."

"x42671","assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no"
"x42671","credit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she"
"x42671","had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she"
"x42671","could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness"
"x42671","of temper, that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave"
"x42671","of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to"
"x42671","the caprice of their inclinations. Had his own happiness, however, been"
"x42671","the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what"
"x42671","ever manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as she"
"x42671","thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, on"
"x42671","which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She"
"x42671","could think of nothing else, and yet whether Bingley's regard had really"
"x42671","died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he"
"x42671","had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his"

"x42671","marriage from Mr. Darcy! that he should have been in love with her for"
"x42671","so many months! so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all"
"x42671","the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her"
"x42671","sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case,"
"x42671","was almost incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously"
"x42671","so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable pride, his"
"x42671","shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane, his"
"x42671","unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it,"
"x42671","and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his"
"x42671","cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the"
"x42671","pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited."
"x42671",""
"x42671","She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady"
"x42671","Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter"
"x42671","Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room."

"x42671",""
"x42671",""
"x42671","Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations"
"x42671","which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the"
"x42671","surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of any thing"
"x42671","else, and totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after"
"x42671","breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding"
"x42671","directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy's"
"x42671","sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,"
"x42671","she turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road."
"x42671","The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed"
"x42671","one of the gates into the ground."
"x42671",""
"x42671","After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was"
"x42671","tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and"
"x42671","look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent, had"
"x42671","made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the"
"x42671","verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk,"
"x42671","when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which"
"x42671","edged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being Mr."
"x42671","Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced, was now"
"x42671","near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced"
"x42671","her name. She had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in"
"x42671","a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the"
"x42671","gate. He had by that time reached it also, and holding out a letter,"
"x42671","which she instinctively took, said with a look of haughty composure, ""I"
"x42671","have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you."
"x42671","Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?""--And then, with a"
"x42671","slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of"
"x42671","sight."
"x42671",""
"x42671","With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,"
"x42671","Elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder,"
"x42671","perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written"
"x42671","quite through, in a very close hand.--The envelope itself was likewise"
"x42671","full.--Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated"
"x42671","from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--"
"x42671",""
"x42671","     ""Be not alarmed, Madam, on receiving this letter, by the"
"x42671","     apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments,"
"x42671","     or renewal of those offers, which were last night so disgusting to"
"x42671","     you. I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling"
"x42671","     myself, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the happiness of both,"
"x42671","     cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation,"
"x42671","     and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been"
"x42671","     spared, had not my character required it to be written and read."
"x42671","     You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your"
"x42671","     attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I"
"x42671","     demand it of your justice."
"x42671",""
"x42671","     ""Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal"
"x42671","     magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned"
"x42671","     was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached"
"x42671","     Mr. Bingley from your sister,--and the other, that I had, in"
"x42671","     defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity,"
"x42671","     ruined the immediate prosperity, and blasted the prospects of Mr."
"x42671","     Wickham.--Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of"
"x42671","     my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who"
"x42671","     had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who"
"x42671","     had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity,"
"x42671","     to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could"
"x42671","     be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.--But"
"x42671","     from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally"
"x42671","     bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in"
"x42671","     future secured, when the following account of my actions and their"
"x42671","     motives has been read.--If, in the explanation of them which is"
"x42671","     due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which"
"x42671","     may be offensive to your's, I can only say that I am sorry.--The"
"x42671","     necessity must be obeyed--and farther apology would be absurd.--I"
"x42671","     had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with"
"x42671","     others, that Bingley preferred your eldest sister, to any other"
"x42671","     young woman in the country.--But it was not till the evening of the"
"x42671","     dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a"
"x42671","     serious attachment.--I had often seen him in love before.--At that"
"x42671","     ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made"
"x42671","     acquainted, by Sir William Lucas's accidental information, that"
"x42671","     Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general"
"x42671","     expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain event,"
"x42671","     of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I"
"x42671","     observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then"
"x42671","     perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had"
"x42671","     ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also watched.--Her look and"
"x42671","     manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any"
"x42671","     symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the"
"x42671","     evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with"
"x42671","     pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of"
"x42671","     sentiment.--If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have"
"x42671","     been in an error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make"
"x42671","     the latter probable.--If it be so, if I have been misled by such"
"x42671","     error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been"
"x42671","     unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity"
"x42671","     of your sister's countenance and air was such, as might have given"
"x42671","     the most acute observer, a conviction that, however amiable her"
"x42671","     temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched.--That I was"
"x42671","     desirous of believing her indifferent is certain,--but I will"
"x42671","     venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually"
"x42671","     influenced by my hopes or fears.--I did not believe her to be"
"x42671","     indifferent because I wished it;--I believed it on impartial"
"x42671","     conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.--My objections to"
"x42671","     the marriage were not merely those, which I last night acknowledged"
"x42671","     to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my"
"x42671","     own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to"
"x42671","     my friend as to me.--But there were other causes of"
"x42671","     repugnance;--causes which, though still existing, and existing to"
"x42671","     an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to"
"x42671","     forget, because they were not immediately before me.--These causes"
"x42671","     must be stated, though briefly.--The situation of your mother's"
"x42671","     family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that"
"x42671","     total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed"
"x42671","     by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by"
"x42671","     your father.--Pardon me.--It pains me to offend you. But amidst"
"x42671","     your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your"
"x42671","     displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you"
"x42671","     consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to"
"x42671","     avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally"
"x42671","     bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to"
"x42671","     the sense and disposition of both.--I will only say farther, that"
"x42671","     from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was"
"x42671","     confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me"
"x42671","     before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy"
"x42671","     connection.--He left Netherfield for London, on the day following,"
"x42671","     as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon"
"x42671","     returning.--The part which I acted, is now to be explained.--His"
"x42671","     sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our"
"x42671","     coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible"
"x42671","     that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly"
"x42671","     resolved on joining him directly in London.--We accordingly"
"x42671","     went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to"
"x42671","     my friend, the certain evils of such a choice.--I described, and"
"x42671","     enforced them earnestly.--But, however this remonstrance might have"
"x42671","     staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it"
"x42671","     would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been"
"x42671","     seconded by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving, of your"
"x42671","     sister's indifference. He had before believed her to return his"
"x42671","     affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.--But Bingley has"
"x42671","     great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment"
"x42671","     than on his own.--To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived"
"x42671","     himself, was no very difficult point. To persuade him against"
"x42671","     returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given,"
"x42671","     was scarcely the work of a moment.--I cannot blame myself for"
"x42671","     having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct in the"
"x42671","     whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is"
"x42671","     that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to"
"x42671","     conceal from him your sister's being in town. I knew it myself, as"
"x42671","     it was known to Miss Bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant"
"x42671","     of it.--That they might have met without ill consequence, is"
"x42671","     perhaps probable;--but his regard did not appear to me enough"
"x42671","     extinguished for him to see her without some danger.--Perhaps this"
"x42671","     concealment, this disguise, was beneath me.--It is done, however,"
"x42671","     and it was done for the best.--On this subject I have nothing more"
"x42671","     to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister's"
"x42671","     feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which"
"x42671","     governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have"
"x42671","     not yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more"
"x42671","     weighty accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only"
"x42671","     refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my"
"x42671","     family. Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but"
"x42671","     of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one"
"x42671","     witness of undoubted veracity. Mr. Wickham is the son of a very"
"x42671","     respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the"
"x42671","     Pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his"
"x42671","     trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on"
"x42671","     George Wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness was therefore"
"x42671","     liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and"
"x42671","     afterwards at Cambridge;--most important assistance, as his own"
"x42671","     father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have"
"x42671","     been unable to give him a gentleman's education. My father was not"
"x42671","     only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always"
"x42671","     engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the"
"x42671","     church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it."
"x42671","     As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think"
"x42671","     of him in a very different manner. The vicious propensities--the"
"x42671","     want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge"
"x42671","     of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man"
"x42671","     of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of"
"x42671","     seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have."
"x42671","     Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you only can tell."
"x42671","     But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a"
"x42671","     suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his"
"x42671","     real character. It adds even another motive. My excellent father"
"x42671","     died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to"
"x42671","     the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it"
"x42671","     to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his"
"x42671","     profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a"
"x42671","     valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became"
"x42671","     vacant. There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own"
"x42671","     father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these"
"x42671","     events, Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally"
"x42671","     resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it"
"x42671","     unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary"
"x42671","     advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be"
"x42671","     benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying the law,"
"x42671","     and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would"
"x42671","     be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than"
"x42671","     believed him to be sincere; but at any rate, was perfectly ready to"
"x42671","     accede to his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a"
"x42671","     clergyman. The business was therefore soon settled. He resigned all"
"x42671","     claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could"
"x42671","     ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three"
"x42671","     thousand pounds. All connection between us seemed now dissolved. I"
"x42671","     thought too ill of him, to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his"
"x42671","     society in town. In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his"
"x42671","     studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all"
"x42671","     restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For"
"x42671","     about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the"
"x42671","     incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied"
"x42671","     to me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he"
"x42671","     assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were"
"x42671","     exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study,"
"x42671","     and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would"
"x42671","     present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there"
"x42671","     could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other"
"x42671","     person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered"
"x42671","     father's intentions. You will hardly blame me for refusing to"
"x42671","     comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it."
"x42671","     His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his"
"x42671","     circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me"
"x42671","     to others, as in his reproaches to myself. After this period, every"
"x42671","     appearance of acquaintance was dropt. How he lived I know not. But"
"x42671","     last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice. I"
"x42671","     must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget"
"x42671","     myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce"
"x42671","     me to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no"
"x42671","     doubt of your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my"
"x42671","     junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel"
"x42671","     Fitzwilliam, and myself. About a year ago, she was taken from"
"x42671","     school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last"
"x42671","     summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate;"
"x42671","     and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there"
"x42671","     proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs."
"x42671","     Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by"
"x42671","     her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,"
"x42671","     whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his"
"x42671","     kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe"
"x42671","     herself in love, and to consent to an elopement. She was then but"
"x42671","     fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her"
"x42671","     imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to"
"x42671","     herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the"
"x42671","     intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea"
"x42671","     of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as"
"x42671","     a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt"
"x42671","     and how I acted. Regard for my sister's credit and feelings"
"x42671","     prevented any public exposure, but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left"
"x42671","     the place immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from"
"x42671","     her charge. Mr. Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my"
"x42671","     sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot"
"x42671","     help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a"
"x42671","     strong inducement. His revenge would have been complete indeed."
"x42671","     This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we"
"x42671","     have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject"
"x42671","     it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty"
"x42671","     towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of"
"x42671","     falsehood he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to"
"x42671","     be wondered at. Ignorant as you previously were of every thing"
"x42671","     concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and"
"x42671","     suspicion certainly not in your inclination. You may possibly"
"x42671","     wonder why all this was not told you last night. But I was not then"
"x42671","     master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed."
"x42671","     For the truth of every thing here related, I can appeal more"
"x42671","     particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who from our"
"x42671","     near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of"
"x42671","     the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted"
"x42671","     with every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of"
"x42671","     _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented"
"x42671","     by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may"
"x42671","     be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find"
"x42671","     some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course"
"x42671","     of the morning. I will only add, God bless you."

"x42671","hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing"
"x42671","what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the"
"x42671","sense of the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister's"
"x42671","insensibility, she instantly resolved to be false, and his account of"
"x42671","the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have"
"x42671","any wish of doing him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had"
"x42671","done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It"
"x42671","was all pride and insolence."
"x42671",""
"x42671","But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham, when"
"x42671","she read with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which,"
"x42671","if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which"
"x42671","bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings"
"x42671","were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition."
"x42671","Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished"
"x42671","to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, ""This must be false!"
"x42671","This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!""--and when she had"
"x42671","gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the"
"x42671","last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not"
"x42671","regard it, that she would never look in it again."
"x42671",""
"x42671","In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on"
"x42671","nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter"
"x42671","was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she"
"x42671","again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and"
"x42671","commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence."
"x42671","The account of his connection with the Pemberley family, was exactly"
"x42671","what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy,"
"x42671","though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his"
"x42671","own words. So far each recital confirmed the other: but when she came to"
"x42671","the will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living"
"x42671","was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was"
"x42671","impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the"
"x42671","other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did"
"x42671","not err. But when she read, and re-read with the closest attention, the"
"x42671","particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions"
"x42671","to the living, of his receiving in lieu, so considerable a sum as three"
"x42671","thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the"
"x42671","letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be"
"x42671","impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with"
"x42671","little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read on."
"x42671","But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had"
"x42671","believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent, as to"
"x42671","render Mr. Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a"
"x42671","turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole."
"x42671",""
"x42671","The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to"
"x42671","Mr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could"
"x42671","bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his"
"x42671","entrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the"
"x42671","persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town,"
"x42671","had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life,"
"x42671","nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As to"
"x42671","his real character, had information been in her power, she had never"
"x42671","felt a wish of enquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner, had"
"x42671","established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried to"
"x42671","recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of"
"x42671","integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr."
"x42671","Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those"
"x42671","casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what Mr. Darcy"
"x42671","had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance. But no"
"x42671","such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before"
"x42671","her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more"
"x42671","substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and"
"x42671","the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After"
"x42671","pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to"
"x42671","read. But, alas! the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy,"
"x42671","received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel"
"x42671","Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was"
"x42671","referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam"
"x42671","himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his"
"x42671","near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no"
"x42671","reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to"
"x42671","him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and"
"x42671","at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never"
"x42671","have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his"
"x42671","cousin's corroboration."

"x42671","struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and"
"x42671","wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting"
"x42671","himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions"
"x42671","with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear"
"x42671","of seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that"
"x42671","_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball"
"x42671","the very next week. She remembered also, that till the Netherfield"
"x42671","family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but"
"x42671","herself; but that after their removal, it had been every where"
"x42671","discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr."

"x42671","His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and"
"x42671","hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer"
"x42671","the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at any thing."
"x42671","His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had"
"x42671","either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying"
"x42671","his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most"
"x42671","incautiously shewn. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter"
"x42671","and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not"
"x42671","but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago"
"x42671","asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as"
"x42671","were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their"

"x42671","that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--any thing that spoke him"
"x42671","of irreligious or immoral habits. That among his own connections he was"
"x42671","esteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a"
"x42671","brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of"
"x42671","his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling. That had"
"x42671","his actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of"
"x42671","every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and"

"x42671","When Lydia went away, she promised to write very often and very minutely"

"x42671","she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a"

"x42671","back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet"
"x42671","was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of June"
"x42671","Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without"

"x42671","present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire. In that"
"x42671","county, there was enough to be seen, to occupy the chief of their three"

"x42671",""
"x42671",""
"x42671","Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of"
"x42671","Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned"
"x42671","in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter."
"x42671",""
"x42671","The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They"
"x42671","entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through"
"x42671","a beautiful wood, stretching over a wide extent."
"x42671",""
"x42671","Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired"
"x42671","every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for"
"x42671","half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable"
"x42671","eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by"
"x42671","Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which"
"x42671","the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome, stone"
"x42671","building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high"
"x42671","woody hills;--and in front, a stream of some natural importance was"
"x42671","swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks"
"x42671","were neither formal, nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She"
"x42671","had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural"
"x42671","beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were"
"x42671","all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt, that"
"x42671","to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!"
"x42671",""
"x42671","They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,"
"x42671","while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of"
"x42671","meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been"
"x42671","mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the"
"x42671","hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to"
"x42671","wonder at her being where she was."
"x42671",""
"x42671","The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking, elderly woman, much less"
"x42671","fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They"
"x42671","followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well-proportioned"
"x42671","room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went"
"x42671","to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, from"
"x42671","which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the"
"x42671","distance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was"
"x42671","good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered"
"x42671","on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace"
"x42671","it, with delight. As they passed into other rooms, these objects were"
"x42671","taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to"
"x42671","be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable"
"x42671","to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration"
"x42671","of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of"
"x42671","splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings."
"x42671",""
"x42671","""And of this place,"" thought she, ""I might have been mistress! With"
"x42671","these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of"

"x42671","sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of"
"x42671","their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds"
"x42671","was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise"
"x42671","of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she"
"x42671","considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--How"
"x42671","much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow!--How much of"
"x42671","good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought"
"x42671","forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she"
"x42671","stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes"
"x42671","upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of"
"x42671","gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and"
"x42671","softened its impropriety of expression."

"x42671","When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,"

"x42671",""
"x42671","As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back"
"x42671","to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was"
"x42671","conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself"
"x42671","suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables."
"x42671",""
"x42671","They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his"
"x42671","appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes"
"x42671","instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest"
"x42671","blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from"
"x42671","surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,"
"x42671","and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least"
"x42671","of perfect civility."
"x42671",""
"x42671","She had instinctively turned away; but, stopping on his approach,"
"x42671","received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be"
"x42671","overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture"
"x42671","they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two"
"x42671","that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on"
"x42671","beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little"
"x42671","aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,"
"x42671","scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she"
"x42671","returned to his civil enquiries after her family. Amazed at the"
"x42671","alteration in his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he"
"x42671","uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the"
"x42671","impropriety of her being found there, recurring to her mind, the few"
"x42671","minutes in which they continued together, were some of the most"
"x42671","uncomfortable of her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he"
"x42671","spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his"
"x42671","enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay"
"x42671","in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the"
"x42671","distraction of his thoughts."
"x42671",""
"x42671","At length, every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few"
"x42671","moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took"
"x42671","leave."
"x42671",""
"x42671","The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his"
"x42671","figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own"
"x42671","feelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and"
"x42671","vexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged"
"x42671","thing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what a"
"x42671","disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if"
"x42671","she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come?"
"x42671","or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been"
"x42671","only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his"
"x42671","discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that"
"x42671","moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and"
"x42671","again over the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so"
"x42671","strikingly altered,--what could it mean? That he should even speak to"
"x42671","her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to enquire after her"
"x42671","family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified,"
"x42671","never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting."
"x42671","What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing's Park, when"
"x42671","he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, nor how to"
"x42671","account for it."
"x42671",""
"x42671","They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and"
"x42671","every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer"

"x42671","before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered"
"x42671","mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed"
"x42671","to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she"
"x42671","distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that"
"x42671","one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then"
"x42671","was. She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in"
"x42671","what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of every thing,"
"x42671","she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil, only because he"
"x42671","felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was"
"x42671","not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing"
"x42671","her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with"
"x42671","composure."
"x42671",""
"x42671","At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind"
"x42671","roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself."
"x42671",""
"x42671","They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,"
"x42671","ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening"
"x42671","of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of"
"x42671","the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods"
"x42671","overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner"
"x42671","expressed a wish of going round the whole Park, but feared it might be"
"x42671","beyond a walk. With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten"
"x42671","miles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed"
"x42671","circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among"
"x42671","hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts."
"x42671","They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of"
"x42671","the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and"
"x42671","the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the"
"x42671","stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered"
"x42671","it. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed"
"x42671","the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,"
"x42671","who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of"
"x42671","returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,"
"x42671","therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house"
"x42671","on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their"
"x42671","progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the"
"x42671","taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the"
"x42671","occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man"
"x42671","about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this"
"x42671","slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was"
"x42671","quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy"
"x42671","approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less"
"x42671","sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they"
"x42671","met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an"
"x42671","interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with"
"x42671","calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,"
"x42671","she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. This idea"
"x42671","lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the"
"x42671","turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance she saw,"
"x42671","that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his"
"x42671","politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;"
"x42671","but she had not got beyond the words ""delightful,"" and ""charming,"" when"
"x42671","some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of"
"x42671","Pemberley from her, might be mischievously construed. Her colour"
"x42671","changed, and she said no more."
"x42671",""
"x42671","Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked"
"x42671","her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends."
"x42671","This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and"
"x42671","she could hardly suppress a smile, at his being now seeking the"
"x42671","acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had"
"x42671","revolted, in his offer to herself. ""What will be his surprise,"" thought"
"x42671","she, ""when he knows who they are! He takes them now for people of"
"x42671","fashion."""
"x42671",""
"x42671","The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their"
"x42671","relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore"
"x42671","it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he"
"x42671","could from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the"
"x42671","connexion was evident; he sustained it however with fortitude, and so"
"x42671","far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into"
"x42671","conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,"
"x42671","could not but triumph. It was consoling, that he should know she had"
"x42671","some relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most"
"x42671","attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every"
"x42671","expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,"
"x42671","his taste, or his good manners."
"x42671",""
"x42671","The conversation soon turned upon fishing, and she heard Mr. Darcy"
"x42671","invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he"
"x42671","chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same"
"x42671","time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of"
"x42671","the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was"
"x42671","walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her"
"x42671","wonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the"
"x42671","compliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was"
"x42671","extreme; and continually was she repeating, ""Why is he so altered? From"
"x42671","what can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake"
"x42671","that his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not"
"x42671","work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should still love"

"x42671","water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated in"
"x42671","Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found"
"x42671","Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred"
"x42671","her husband's. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on"
"x42671","together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him to"
"x42671","know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the"
"x42671","place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been"
"x42671","very unexpected--""for your housekeeper,"" she added, ""informed us that"
"x42671","you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we"
"x42671","left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in"
"x42671","the country."" He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that"

"x42671","before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. ""They"
"x42671","will join me early to-morrow,"" he continued, ""and among them are some"
"x42671","who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr. Bingley and his sisters."""

"x42671","Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly"
"x42671","driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley's name had been last mentioned"

"x42671","not very differently engaged."

"x42671","The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great"

"x42671","that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her,"
"x42671","must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was"
"x42671","satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made"
"x42671","him think really ill of her."

"x42671","They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth"
"x42671","was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and"

"x42671","the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had"

"x42671","He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not"

"x42671","there seemed an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected that"
"x42671","she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with"
"x42671","great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience"

"x42671","carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a"
"x42671","curricle, driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognising the"
"x42671","livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise"
"x42671","to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she"
"x42671","expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment"
"x42671","of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many"
"x42671","of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on"
"x42671","the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt"
"x42671","that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such"
"x42671","a quarter, than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these"
"x42671","newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of"

"x42671","at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she"
"x42671","dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in"

"x42671","arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards"
"x42671","each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from"
"x42671","those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what"
"x42671","it was to love. Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in"
"x42671","doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was"

"x42671","Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the"

"x42671","feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she"
"x42671","endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley"
"x42671","was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased."

"x42671","like manner. Sometimes she could fancy, that he talked less than on"
"x42671","former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that"
"x42671","as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But, though"
"x42671","this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour"
"x42671","to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival of Jane. No look appeared"
"x42671","on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between"
"x42671","them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point she was"
"x42671","soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they"
"x42671","parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of"
"x42671","Jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that"
"x42671","might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed to her, at a"
"x42671","moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had"
"x42671","something of real regret, that it ""was a very long time since he had had"
"x42671","the pleasure of seeing her;"" and, before she could reply, he added, ""It"
"x42671","is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of November, when"
"x42671","we were all dancing together at Netherfield."""

"x42671","whether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the"
"x42671","question, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and a manner"

"x42671","It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but,"
"x42671","whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general"

"x42671","removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that"
"x42671","the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however"
"x42671","temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When"
"x42671","she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion"
"x42671","of people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a"
"x42671","disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the"
"x42671","very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last"
"x42671","lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the change was so"
"x42671","great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly"
"x42671","restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company"
"x42671","of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at"
"x42671","Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from"
"x42671","self-consequence, or unbending reserve as now, when no importance could"
"x42671","result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the"

"x42671","at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a"

"x42671","this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors"
"x42671","left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some"

"x42671","little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her"
"x42671","uncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their"
"x42671","favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress."
"x42671",""
"x42671","But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; it was"
"x42671","not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was"
"x42671","much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;"
"x42671","it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to"
"x42671","interest, but nothing to justify enquiry."
"x42671",""
"x42671","Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far"
"x42671","as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could"
"x42671","not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character"
"x42671","from their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference"
"x42671","to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known,"
"x42671","would not have recognised it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,"
"x42671","however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible,"
"x42671","that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four"
"x42671","years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be"
"x42671","hastily rejected. Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of"
"x42671","their Lambton friends, that could materially lessen its weight. They"
"x42671","had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if"
"x42671","not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small"
"x42671","market-town, where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged,"
"x42671","however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor."
"x42671",""
"x42671","With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held"
"x42671","there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns, with the"
"x42671","son of his patron, were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well known"
"x42671","fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind"
"x42671","him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged."
"x42671",""
"x42671","As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than"
"x42671","the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not"
"x42671","long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and"
"x42671","she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out. She"
"x42671","certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she"
"x42671","had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,"
"x42671","that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his"
"x42671","valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some"
"x42671","time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened"
"x42671","into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his"
"x42671","favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,"
"x42671","which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,"
"x42671","there was a motive within her of good will which could not be"
"x42671","overlooked. It was gratitude.--Gratitude, not merely for having once"
"x42671","loved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the"
"x42671","petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the"
"x42671","unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been"
"x42671","persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this"
"x42671","accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without"
"x42671","any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where"
"x42671","their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion"
"x42671","of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such a"
"x42671","change in a man of so much pride, excited not only astonishment but"
"x42671","gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such"
"x42671","its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means"
"x42671","unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She respected, she"
"x42671","esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his"
"x42671","welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to"
"x42671","depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both"
"x42671","that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still"
"x42671","possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses."

"x42671","It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that"

"x42671","breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by"
"x42671","some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it"

"x42671",""
"x42671","Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had"
"x42671","originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome"
"x42671","her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with"
"x42671","how much civility on that lady's side, the acquaintance would now be"
"x42671","renewed."
"x42671",""
"x42671","On reaching the house, they were shewn through the hall into the saloon,"
"x42671","whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows"
"x42671","opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody"
"x42671","hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chesnuts"
"x42671","which were scattered over the intermediate lawn."
"x42671",""
"x42671","In this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there"
"x42671","with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in"
"x42671","London. Georgiana's reception of them was very civil; but attended with"
"x42671","all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the"
"x42671","fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves"
"x42671","inferior, the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and"
"x42671","her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her."
"x42671",""
"x42671","By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and"
"x42671","on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,"
"x42671","succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a"
"x42671","genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind"
"x42671","of discourse, proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the"
"x42671","others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from"
"x42671","Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she"
"x42671","wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a"
"x42671","short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard."
"x42671",""
"x42671","Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,"
"x42671","and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without"
"x42671","calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her"
"x42671","from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an"
"x42671","inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity"
"x42671","of saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every"
"x42671","moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she"
"x42671","feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether"
"x42671","she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After"
"x42671","sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss"
"x42671","Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold"
"x42671","enquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal"
"x42671","indifference and brevity, and the other said no more."
"x42671",""
"x42671","The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the"
"x42671","entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the"
"x42671","finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a"
"x42671","significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been"
"x42671","given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole"
"x42671","party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the"
"x42671","beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected"
"x42671","them round the table."
"x42671",""
"x42671","While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether"
"x42671","she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the"
"x42671","feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but"
"x42671","a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to"
"x42671","regret that he came."
"x42671",""
"x42671","He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other"
"x42671","gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him"
"x42671","only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to"
"x42671","Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely"
"x42671","resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more"
"x42671","necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she"
"x42671","saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,"
"x42671","and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour"

"x42671","curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the"
"x42671","smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its"
"x42671","objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions"
"x42671","to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother's"
"x42671","entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he"
"x42671","was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,"
"x42671","as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss"
"x42671","Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the"

"x42671","""Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?"
"x42671","They must be a great loss to _your_ family."""
"x42671",""
"x42671","In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth"

"x42671","but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she"

"x42671","she spoke, an involuntary glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened"
"x42671","complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with"
"x42671","confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what"
"x42671","pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have"
"x42671","refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose"
"x42671","Elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed"
"x42671","her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in"
"x42671","Darcy's opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and"
"x42671","absurdities, by which some part of her family were connected with that"
"x42671","corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated"
"x42671","elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was"
"x42671","possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections her"
"x42671","brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish"
"x42671","which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming"
"x42671","hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without"
"x42671","meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss"
"x42671","Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern"
"x42671","for the welfare of his friend."

"x42671","Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and"

"x42671","her. Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his"
"x42671","judgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as"
"x42671","to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than"

"x42671","     poor Lydia. An express came at twelve last night, just as we were"
"x42671","     all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was"
"x42671","     gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth,"
"x42671","     with Wickham!--Imagine our surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not"

"x42671","     match on both sides!--But I am willing to hope the best, and that"
"x42671","     his character has been misunderstood. Thoughtless and indiscreet I"
"x42671","     can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it)"
"x42671","     marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is disinterested at least,"
"x42671","     for he must know my father can give her nothing. Our poor mother"
"x42671","     is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How thankful am I,"
"x42671","     that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must"
"x42671","     forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about twelve, as"
"x42671","     is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at"
"x42671","     eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must"
"x42671","     have passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason"
"x42671","     to expect him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife,"
"x42671","     informing her of their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be"

"x42671","     into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them"
"x42671","     from Epsom. All that is known after this is, that they were seen"
"x42671","     to continue the London road. I know not what to think. After making"
"x42671","     every possible enquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on into"
"x42671","     Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at"
"x42671","     the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success, no such"

"x42671","     came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner"
"x42671","     most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved for him and"
"x42671","     Mrs. F. but no one can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my"
"x42671","     dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the worst,"
"x42671","     but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make it"
"x42671","     more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to"
"x42671","     pursue their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design"
"x42671","     against a young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely,"
"x42671","     can I suppose her so lost to every thing?--Impossible. I grieve to"
"x42671","     find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their"
"x42671","     marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he"
"x42671","     feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill"
"x42671","     and keeps her room. Could she exert herself it would be better, but"
"x42671","     this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in my life"
"x42671","     saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed"
"x42671","     their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot"
"x42671","     wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared"
"x42671","     something of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock"
"x42671","     is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so"

"x42671","     but circumstances are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging"

"x42671","with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must"
"x42671","produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched"

"x42671","could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost"

"x42671","cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on"
"x42671","the postscript of the last, with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had"
"x42671","never been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be"

"x42671","the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived"

"x42671","respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of"
"x42671","honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of"
"x42671","prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be"
"x42671","her husband, might then have rested in its proper place."
"x42671",""
"x42671","He was seriously concerned, that a cause of so little advantage to any"
"x42671","one, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law, and"
"x42671","he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his"
"x42671","assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could."
"x42671",""
"x42671","When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly"
"x42671","useless; for, of course, they were to have a son. This son was to join"
"x42671","in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow"
"x42671","and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters"
"x42671","successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs."
"x42671","Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he"
"x42671","would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too"
"x42671","late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her"
"x42671","husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their"
"x42671","income."
"x42671",""
"x42671","Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and"
"x42671","the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the"
"x42671","latter, depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with"
"x42671","regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet"
"x42671","could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In"
"x42671","terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though"
"x42671","expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect"
"x42671","approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the"
"x42671","engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed"
"x42671","that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be"
"x42671","done with so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present"
"x42671","arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser, by the"
"x42671","hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket"
"x42671","allowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her,"

"x42671","That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was"
"x42671","another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to"

"x42671","transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were"
"x42671","over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was"

"x42671","The good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate"

"x42671","     Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. It was all"
"x42671","     over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked"
"x42671","     as _your's_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that"
"x42671","     he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that"
"x42671","     he had seen and talked with them both, Wickham repeatedly, Lydia"
"x42671","     once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day"
"x42671","     after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting"
"x42671","     for them. The motive professed, was his conviction of its being"
"x42671","     owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well"
"x42671","     known, as to make it impossible for any young woman of character,"
"x42671","     to love or confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his"
"x42671","     mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath"
"x42671","     him, to lay his private actions open to the world. His character"
"x42671","     was to speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step"
"x42671","     forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil, which had been brought on"
"x42671","     by himself. If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never"
"x42671","     disgrace him. He had been some days in town, before he was able to"
"x42671","     discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was"
"x42671","     more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this, was another"
"x42671","     reason for his resolving to follow us. There is a lady, it seems, a"
"x42671","     Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was"
"x42671","     dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though"
"x42671","     he did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward-street,"
"x42671","     and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs."
"x42671","     Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he"
"x42671","     went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town. But"
"x42671","     it was two or three days before he could get from her what he"
"x42671","     wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery"
"x42671","     and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be"
"x42671","     found. Wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in"
"x42671","     London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they"
"x42671","     would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our"
"x42671","     kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in ----"
"x42671","     street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia."
"x42671","     His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade"
"x42671","     her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her"
"x42671","     friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,"
"x42671","     offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But he found Lydia"
"x42671","     absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none"
"x42671","     of her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of"
"x42671","     leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or"
"x42671","     other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her"
"x42671","     feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a"
"x42671","     marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he"
"x42671","     easily learnt, had never been _his_ design. He confessed himself"
"x42671","     obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour,"
"x42671","     which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the"
"x42671","     ill-consequences of Lydia's flight, on her own folly alone. He"
"x42671","     meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future"
"x42671","     situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He must go"
"x42671","     somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have"
"x42671","     nothing to live on. Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your"
"x42671","     sister at once. Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich,"
"x42671","     he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation"
"x42671","     must have been benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to"
"x42671","     this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more"
"x42671","     effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country."
"x42671","     Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof"
"x42671","     against the temptation of immediate relief. They met several times,"
"x42671","     for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of course wanted more"
"x42671","     than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable."
"x42671","     Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy's next step was"
"x42671","     to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in"
"x42671","     Gracechurch-street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner"
"x42671","     could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further enquiry, that"
"x42671","     your father was still with him, but would quit town the next"
"x42671","     morning. He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could"
"x42671","     so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed"
"x42671","     seeing him, till after the departure of the former. He did not"
"x42671","     leave his name, and till the next day, it was only known that a"
"x42671","     gentleman had called on business. On Saturday he came again. Your"
"x42671","     father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they"
"x42671","     had a great deal of talk together. They met again on Sunday, and"
"x42671","     then _I_ saw him too. It was not all settled before Monday: as soon"
"x42671","     as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor"
"x42671","     was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real"
"x42671","     defect of his character after all. He has been accused of many"
"x42671","     faults at different times; but _this_ is the true one. Nothing was"
"x42671","     to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do"
"x42671","     not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it,) your"
"x42671","     uncle would most readily have settled the whole. They battled it"
"x42671","     together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman"
"x42671","     or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle was forced"
"x42671","     to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece,"
"x42671","     was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,"
"x42671","     which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your"
"x42671","     letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an"
"x42671","     explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give"
"x42671","     the praise where it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther"
"x42671","     than yourself, or Jane at most. You know pretty well, I suppose,"
"x42671","     what has been done for the young people. His debts are to be paid,"
"x42671","     amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds,"
"x42671","     another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his"
"x42671","     commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him"
"x42671","     alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his"
"x42671","     reserve, and want of proper consideration, that Wickham's character"
"x42671","     had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been"
"x42671","     received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in"
"x42671","     _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_"
"x42671","     reserve, can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this"
"x42671","     fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured, that"
"x42671","     your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit"
"x42671","     for _another interest_ in the affair. When all this was resolved"
"x42671","     on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at"
"x42671","     Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more"
"x42671","     when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to"
"x42671","     receive the last finish. I believe I have now told you every thing."
"x42671","     It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I"
"x42671","     hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to"
"x42671","     us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house. _He_ was"
"x42671","     exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I"
"x42671","     would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour"
"x42671","     while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane's letter"
"x42671","     last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a"
"x42671","     piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you, can give you no"
"x42671","     fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,"
"x42671","     representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and"
"x42671","     all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me,"
"x42671","     it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was"
"x42671","     sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth"
"x42671","     and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her. Mr. Darcy was"
"x42671","     punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the"
"x42671","     wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again"
"x42671","     on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear"
"x42671","     Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold"
"x42671","     enough to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has,"
"x42671","     in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire."
