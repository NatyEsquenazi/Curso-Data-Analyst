"x83","THE GUN CLUB"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","During the War of the Rebellion, a new and influential club was"
"x83","established in the city of Baltimore in the State of Maryland. It is"
"x83","well known with what energy the taste for military matters became"
"x83","developed among that nation of ship-owners, shopkeepers, and mechanics."
"x83","Simple tradesmen jumped their counters to become extemporized captains,"
"x83","colonels, and generals, without having ever passed the School of"
"x83","Instruction at West Point; nevertheless; they quickly rivaled their"
"x83","compeers of the old continent, and, like them, carried off victories by"
"x83","dint of lavish expenditure in ammunition, money, and men."
"x83",""
"x83","But the point in which the Americans singularly distanced the Europeans"
"x83","was in the science of _gunnery_. Not, indeed, that their weapons"
"x83","retained a higher degree of perfection than theirs, but that they"
"x83","exhibited unheard-of dimensions, and consequently attained hitherto"
"x83","unheard-of ranges. In point of grazing, plunging, oblique, or"
"x83","enfilading, or point-blank firing, the English, French, and Prussians"
"x83","have nothing to learn; but their cannon, howitzers, and mortars are"
"x83","mere pocket-pistols compared with the formidable engines of the"
"x83","American artillery."
"x83",""
"x83","This fact need surprise no one. The Yankees, the first mechanicians in"
"x83","the world, are engineers—just as the Italians are musicians and the"
"x83","Germans metaphysicians—by right of birth. Nothing is more natural,"
"x83","therefore, than to perceive them applying their audacious ingenuity to"
"x83","the science of gunnery. Witness the marvels of Parrott, Dahlgren, and"
"x83","Rodman. The Armstrong, Palliser, and Beaulieu guns were compelled to"
"x83","bow before their transatlantic rivals."
"x83",""
"x83","Now when an American has an idea, he directly seeks a second American"
"x83","to share it. If there be three, they elect a president and two"
"x83","secretaries. Given _four_, they name a keeper of records, and the"
"x83","office is ready for work; _five_, they convene a general meeting, and"
"x83","the club is fully constituted. So things were managed in Baltimore. The"
"x83","inventor of a new cannon associated himself with the caster and the"
"x83","borer. Thus was formed the nucleus of the “Gun Club.” In a single month"
"x83","after its formation it numbered 1,833 effective members and 30,565"
"x83","corresponding members."
"x83",""
"x83","One condition was imposed as a _sine quâ non_ upon every candidate for"
"x83","admission into the association, and that was the condition of having"
"x83","designed, or (more or less) perfected a cannon; or, in default of a"
"x83","cannon, at least a firearm of some description. It may, however, be"
"x83","mentioned that mere inventors of revolvers, fire-shooting carbines, and"
"x83","similar small arms, met with little consideration. Artillerists always"
"x83","commanded the chief place of favor."
"x83",""
"x83","The estimation in which these gentlemen were held, according to one of"
"x83","the most scientific exponents of the Gun Club, was “proportional to the"
"x83","masses of their guns, and in the direct ratio of the square of the"
"x83","distances attained by their projectiles.”"
"x83",""
"x83","The Gun Club once founded, it is easy to conceive the result of the"
"x83","inventive genius of the Americans. Their military weapons attained"
"x83","colossal proportions, and their projectiles, exceeding the prescribed"
"x83","limits, unfortunately occasionally cut in two some unoffending"
"x83","pedestrians. These inventions, in fact, left far in the rear the timid"
"x83","instruments of European artillery."
"x83",""
"x83","It is but fair to add that these Yankees, brave as they have ever"
"x83","proved themselves to be, did not confine themselves to theories and"
"x83","formulae, but that they paid heavily, _in propriâ personâ_, for their"
"x83","inventions. Among them were to be counted officers of all ranks, from"
"x83","lieutenants to generals; military men of every age, from those who were"
"x83","just making their _début_ in the profession of arms up to those who had"
"x83","grown old in the gun-carriage. Many had found their rest on the field"
"x83","of battle whose names figured in the “Book of Honor” of the Gun Club;"
"x83","and of those who made good their return the greater proportion bore the"
"x83","marks of their indisputable valor. Crutches, wooden legs, artificial"
"x83","arms, steel hooks, caoutchouc jaws, silver craniums, platinum noses,"
"x83","were all to be found in the collection; and it was calculated by the"
"x83","great statistician Pitcairn that throughout the Gun Club there was not"
"x83","quite one arm between four persons and two legs between six."
"x83",""
"x83","Nevertheless, these valiant artillerists took no particular account of"
"x83","these little facts, and felt justly proud when the despatches of a"
"x83","battle returned the number of victims at ten-fold the quantity of"
"x83","projectiles expended."
"x83",""
"x83","One day, however—sad and melancholy day!—peace was signed between the"
"x83","survivors of the war; the thunder of the guns gradually ceased, the"
"x83","mortars were silent, the howitzers were muzzled for an indefinite"
"x83","period, the cannon, with muzzles depressed, were returned into the"
"x83","arsenal, the shot were repiled, all bloody reminiscences were effaced;"
"x83","the cotton-plants grew luxuriantly in the well-manured fields, all"
"x83","mourning garments were laid aside, together with grief; and the Gun"
"x83","Club was relegated to profound inactivity."
"x83",""
"x83","Some few of the more advanced and inveterate theorists set themselves"
"x83","again to work upon calculations regarding the laws of projectiles. They"
"x83","reverted invariably to gigantic shells and howitzers of unparalleled"
"x83","caliber. Still in default of practical experience what was the value of"
"x83","mere theories? Consequently, the clubrooms became deserted, the"
"x83","servants dozed in the antechambers, the newspapers grew mouldy on the"
"x83","tables, sounds of snoring came from dark corners, and the members of"
"x83","the Gun Club, erstwhile so noisy in their seances, were reduced to"
"x83","silence by this disastrous peace and gave themselves up wholly to"
"x83","dreams of a Platonic kind of artillery."
"x83",""
"x83","“This is horrible!” said Tom Hunter one evening, while rapidly"
"x83","carbonizing his wooden legs in the fireplace of the smoking-room;"
"x83","“nothing to do! nothing to look forward to! what a loathsome existence!"
"x83","When again shall the guns arouse us in the morning with their"
"x83","delightful reports?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Those days are gone by,” said jolly Bilsby, trying to extend his"
"x83","missing arms. “It was delightful once upon a time! One invented a gun,"
"x83","and hardly was it cast, when one hastened to try it in the face of the"
"x83","enemy! Then one returned to camp with a word of encouragement from"
"x83","Sherman or a friendly shake of the hand from McClellan. But now the"
"x83","generals are gone back to their counters; and in place of projectiles,"
"x83","they despatch bales of cotton. By Jove, the future of gunnery in"
"x83","America is lost!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Ay! and no war in prospect!” continued the famous James T. Maston,"
"x83","scratching with his steel hook his gutta-percha cranium. “Not a cloud"
"x83","on the horizon! and that too at such a critical period in the progress"
"x83","of the science of artillery! Yes, gentlemen! I who address you have"
"x83","myself this very morning perfected a model (plan, section, elevation,"
"x83","etc.) of a mortar destined to change all the conditions of warfare!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“No! is it possible?” replied Tom Hunter, his thoughts reverting"
"x83","involuntarily to a former invention of the Hon. J. T. Maston, by which,"
"x83","at its first trial, he had succeeded in killing three hundred and"
"x83","thirty-seven people."
"x83",""
"x83","“Fact!” replied he. “Still, what is the use of so many studies worked"
"x83","out, so many difficulties vanquished? It’s mere waste of time! The New"
"x83","World seems to have made up its mind to live in peace; and our"
"x83","bellicose _Tribune_ predicts some approaching catastrophes arising out"
"x83","of this scandalous increase of population.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Nevertheless,” replied Colonel Blomsberry, “they are always struggling"
"x83","in Europe to maintain the principle of nationalities.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Well?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Well, there might be some field for enterprise down there; and if they"
"x83","would accept our services—”"
"x83",""
"x83","“What are you dreaming of?” screamed Bilsby; “work at gunnery for the"
"x83","benefit of foreigners?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“That would be better than doing nothing here,” returned the colonel."
"x83",""
"x83","“Quite so,” said J. T. Matson; “but still we need not dream of that"
"x83","expedient.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“And why not?” demanded the colonel."
"x83",""
"x83","“Because their ideas of progress in the Old World are contrary to our"
"x83","American habits of thought. Those fellows believe that one can’t become"
"x83","a general without having served first as an ensign; which is as much as"
"x83","to say that one can’t point a gun without having first cast it"
"x83","oneself!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Ridiculous!” replied Tom Hunter, whittling with his bowie-knife the"
"x83","arms of his easy chair; “but if that be the case there, all that is"
"x83","left for us is to plant tobacco and distill whale-oil.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“What!” roared J. T. Maston, “shall we not employ these remaining years"
"x83","of our life in perfecting firearms? Shall there never be a fresh"
"x83","opportunity of trying the ranges of projectiles? Shall the air never"
"x83","again be lighted with the glare of our guns? No international"
"x83","difficulty ever arise to enable us to declare war against some"
"x83","transatlantic power? Shall not the French sink one of our steamers, or"
"x83","the English, in defiance of the rights of nations, hang a few of our"
"x83","countrymen?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“No such luck,” replied Colonel Blomsberry; “nothing of the kind is"
"x83","likely to happen; and even if it did, we should not profit by it."
"x83","American susceptibility is fast declining, and we are all going to the"
"x83","dogs.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“It is too true,” replied J. T. Maston, with fresh violence; “there are"
"x83","a thousand grounds for fighting, and yet we don’t fight. We save up our"
"x83","arms and legs for the benefit of nations who don’t know what to do with"
"x83","them! But stop—without going out of one’s way to find a cause for"
"x83","war—did not North America once belong to the English?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Undoubtedly,” replied Tom Hunter, stamping his crutch with fury."
"x83",""
"x83","“Well, then,” replied J. T. Maston, “why should not England in her turn"
"x83","belong to the Americans?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“It would be but just and fair,” returned Colonel Blomsberry."
"x83",""
"x83","“Go and propose it to the President of the United States,” cried J. T."
"x83","Maston, “and see how he will receive you.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Bah!” growled Bilsby between the four teeth which the war had left"
"x83","him; “that will never do!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“By Jove!” cried J. T. Maston, “he mustn’t count on my vote at the next"
"x83","election!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Nor on ours,” replied unanimously all the bellicose invalids."
"x83",""
"x83","“Meanwhile,” replied J. T. Maston, “allow me to say that, if I cannot"
"x83","get an opportunity to try my new mortars on a real field of battle, I"
"x83","shall say good-by to the members of the Gun Club, and go and bury"
"x83","myself in the prairies of Arkansas!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“In that case we will accompany you,” cried the others."
"x83",""
"x83","Matters were in this unfortunate condition, and the club was threatened"
"x83","with approaching dissolution, when an unexpected circumstance occurred"
"x83","to prevent so deplorable a catastrophe."
"x83",""
"x83","On the morrow after this conversation every member of the association"
"x83","received a sealed circular couched in the following terms:"
"x83",""
"x83","BALTIMORE, October 3. The president of the Gun Club has the honor to"
"x83","inform his colleagues that, at the meeting of the 5th instant, he will"
"x83","bring before them a communication of an extremely interesting nature."
"x83","He requests, therefore, that they will make it convenient to attend in"
"x83","accordance with the present invitation. Very cordially, IMPEY"
"x83","BARBICANE, P.G.C."
"x83",""
"x83",""

"x83",""
"x83","CHAPTER II."
"x83","PRESIDENT BARBICANE’S COMMUNICATION"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","On the 5th of October, at eight p.m., a dense crowd pressed toward the"
"x83","saloons of the Gun Club at No. 21 Union Square. All the members of the"
"x83","association resident in Baltimore attended the invitation of their"
"x83","president. As regards the corresponding members, notices were delivered"
"x83","by hundreds throughout the streets of the city, and, large as was the"
"x83","great hall, it was quite inadequate to accommodate the crowd of"
"x83","_savants_. They overflowed into the adjoining rooms, down the narrow"
"x83","passages, into the outer courtyards. There they ran against the vulgar"
"x83","herd who pressed up to the doors, each struggling to reach the front"
"x83","ranks, all eager to learn the nature of the important communication of"
"x83","President Barbicane; all pushing, squeezing, crushing with that perfect"
"x83","freedom of action which is so peculiar to the masses when educated in"
"x83","ideas of “self-government.”"
"x83",""
"x83","On that evening a stranger who might have chanced to be in Baltimore"
"x83","could not have gained admission for love or money into the great hall."
"x83","That was reserved exclusively for resident or corresponding members; no"
"x83","one else could possibly have obtained a place; and the city magnates,"
"x83","municipal councilors, and “select men” were compelled to mingle with"
"x83","the mere townspeople in order to catch stray bits of news from the"
"x83","interior."
"x83",""
"x83","Nevertheless the vast hall presented a curious spectacle. Its immense"
"x83","area was singularly adapted to the purpose. Lofty pillars formed of"
"x83","cannon, superposed upon huge mortars as a base, supported the fine"
"x83","ironwork of the arches, a perfect piece of cast-iron lacework. Trophies"
"x83","of blunderbuses, matchlocks, arquebuses, carbines, all kinds of"
"x83","firearms, ancient and modern, were picturesquely interlaced against the"
"x83","walls. The gas lit up in full glare myriads of revolvers grouped in the"
"x83","form of lustres, while groups of pistols, and candelabra formed of"
"x83","muskets bound together, completed this magnificent display of"
"x83","brilliance. Models of cannon, bronze castings, sights covered with"
"x83","dents, plates battered by the shots of the Gun Club, assortments of"
"x83","rammers and sponges, chaplets of shells, wreaths of projectiles,"
"x83","garlands of howitzers—in short, all the apparatus of the artillerist,"
"x83","enchanted the eye by this wonderful arrangement and induced a kind of"
"x83","belief that their real purpose was ornamental rather than deadly."
"x83",""
"x83","At the further end of the saloon the president, assisted by four"
"x83","secretaries, occupied a large platform. His chair, supported by a"
"x83","carved gun-carriage, was modeled upon the ponderous proportions of a"
"x83","32-inch mortar. It was pointed at an angle of ninety degrees, and"
"x83","suspended upon truncheons, so that the president could balance himself"
"x83","upon it as upon a rocking-chair, a very agreeable fact in the very hot"
"x83","weather. Upon the table (a huge iron plate supported upon six"
"x83","carronades) stood an inkstand of exquisite elegance, made of a"
"x83","beautifully chased Spanish piece, and a sonnette, which, when required,"
"x83","could give forth a report equal to that of a revolver. During violent"
"x83","debates this novel kind of bell scarcely sufficed to drown the clamor"
"x83","of these excitable artillerists."
"x83",""
"x83","In front of the table benches arranged in zigzag form, like the"
"x83","circumvallations of a retrenchment, formed a succession of bastions and"
"x83","curtains set apart for the use of the members of the club; and on this"
"x83","especial evening one might say, “All the world was on the ramparts.”"
"x83","The president was sufficiently well known, however, for all to be"
"x83","assured that he would not put his colleagues to discomfort without some"
"x83","very strong motive."
"x83",""
"x83","Impey Barbicane was a man of forty years of age, calm, cold, austere;"
"x83","of a singularly serious and self-contained demeanor, punctual as a"
"x83","chronometer, of imperturbable temper and immovable character; by no"
"x83","means chivalrous, yet adventurous withal, and always bringing practical"
"x83","ideas to bear upon the very rashest enterprises; an essentially New"
"x83","Englander, a Northern colonist, a descendant of the old anti-Stuart"
"x83","Roundheads, and the implacable enemy of the gentlemen of the South,"
"x83","those ancient cavaliers of the mother country. In a word, he was a"
"x83","Yankee to the backbone."
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane had made a large fortune as a timber merchant. Being"
"x83","nominated director of artillery during the war, he proved himself"
"x83","fertile in invention. Bold in his conceptions, he contributed"
"x83","powerfully to the progress of that arm and gave an immense impetus to"
"x83","experimental researches."
"x83",""
"x83","He was personage of the middle height, having, by a rare exception in"
"x83","the Gun Club, all his limbs complete. His strongly marked features"
"x83","seemed drawn by square and rule; and if it be true that, in order to"
"x83","judge a man’s character one must look at his profile, Barbicane, so"
"x83","examined, exhibited the most certain indications of energy, audacity,"
"x83","and _sang-froid_."
"x83",""
"x83","At this moment he was sitting in his armchair, silent, absorbed, lost"
"x83","in reflection, sheltered under his high-crowned hat—a kind of black"
"x83","cylinder which always seems firmly screwed upon the head of an"
"x83","American."
"x83",""
"x83","Just when the deep-toned clock in the great hall struck eight,"
"x83","Barbicane, as if he had been set in motion by a spring, raised himself"
"x83","up. A profound silence ensued, and the speaker, in a somewhat emphatic"
"x83","tone of voice, commenced as follows:"
"x83",""
"x83","“My brave, colleagues, too long already a paralyzing peace has plunged"
"x83","the members of the Gun Club in deplorable inactivity. After a period of"
"x83","years full of incidents we have been compelled to abandon our labors,"
"x83","and to stop short on the road of progress. I do not hesitate to state,"
"x83","baldly, that any war which would recall us to arms would be welcome!”"
"x83","(_Tremendous applause!_) “But war, gentlemen, is impossible under"
"x83","existing circumstances; and, however we may desire it, many years may"
"x83","elapse before our cannon shall again thunder in the field of battle. We"
"x83","must make up our minds, then, to seek in another train of ideas some"
"x83","field for the activity which we all pine for.”"
"x83",""
"x83","The meeting felt that the president was now approaching the critical"
"x83","point, and redoubled their attention accordingly."
"x83",""
"x83","“For some months past, my brave colleagues,” continued Barbicane, “I"
"x83","have been asking myself whether, while confining ourselves to our own"
"x83","particular objects, we could not enter upon some grand experiment"
"x83","worthy of the nineteenth century; and whether the progress of artillery"
"x83","science would not enable us to carry it out to a successful issue. I"
"x83","have been considering, working, calculating; and the result of my"
"x83","studies is the conviction that we are safe to succeed in an enterprise"
"x83","which to any other country would appear wholly impracticable. This"
"x83","project, the result of long elaboration, is the object of my present"
"x83","communication. It is worthy of yourselves, worthy of the antecedents of"
"x83","the Gun Club; and it cannot fail to make some noise in the world.”"
"x83",""
"x83","A thrill of excitement ran through the meeting."
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane, having by a rapid movement firmly fixed his hat upon his"
"x83","head, calmly continued his harangue:"
"x83",""
"x83","“There is no one among you, my brave colleagues, who has not seen the"
"x83","Moon, or, at least, heard speak of it. Don’t be surprised if I am about"
"x83","to discourse to you regarding the Queen of the Night. It is perhaps"
"x83","reserved for us to become the Columbuses of this unknown world. Only"
"x83","enter into my plans, and second me with all your power, and I will lead"
"x83","you to its conquest, and its name shall be added to those of the"
"x83","thirty-six states which compose this Great Union.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Three cheers for the Moon!” roared the Gun Club, with one voice."
"x83",""
"x83","“The moon, gentlemen, has been carefully studied,” continued Barbicane;"
"x83","“her mass, density, and weight; her constitution, motions, distance, as"
"x83","well as her place in the solar system, have all been exactly"
"x83","determined. Selenographic charts have been constructed with a"
"x83","perfection which equals, if it does not even surpass, that of our"
"x83","terrestrial maps. Photography has given us proofs of the incomparable"
"x83","beauty of our satellite; all is known regarding the moon which"
"x83","mathematical science, astronomy, geology, and optics can learn about"
"x83","her. But up to the present moment no direct communication has been"
"x83","established with her.”"
"x83",""
"x83","A violent movement of interest and surprise here greeted this remark of"
"x83","the speaker."
"x83",""
"x83","“Permit me,” he continued, “to recount to you briefly how certain"
"x83","ardent spirits, starting on imaginary journeys, have penetrated the"
"x83","secrets of our satellite. In the seventeenth century a certain David"
"x83","Fabricius boasted of having seen with his own eyes the inhabitants of"
"x83","the moon. In 1649 a Frenchman, one Jean Baudoin, published a ‘Journey"
"x83","performed from the Earth to the Moon by Domingo Gonzalez,’ a Spanish"
"x83","adventurer. At the same period Cyrano de Bergerac published that"
"x83","celebrated ‘Journeys in the Moon’ which met with such success in"
"x83","France. Somewhat later another Frenchman, named Fontenelle, wrote ‘The"
"x83","Plurality of Worlds,’ a _chef-d’œuvre_ of its time. About 1835 a small"
"x83","treatise, translated from the _New York American_, related how Sir John"
"x83","Herschel, having been despatched to the Cape of Good Hope for the"
"x83","purpose of making there some astronomical calculations, had, by means"
"x83","of a telescope brought to perfection by means of internal lighting,"
"x83","reduced the apparent distance of the moon to eighty yards! He then"
"x83","distinctly perceived caverns frequented by hippopotami, green mountains"
"x83","bordered by golden lace-work, sheep with horns of ivory, a white"
"x83","species of deer and inhabitants with membranous wings, like bats. This"
"x83","_brochure_, the work of an American named Locke, had a great sale. But,"
"x83","to bring this rapid sketch to a close, I will only add that a certain"
"x83","Hans Pfaal, of Rotterdam, launching himself in a balloon filled with a"
"x83","gas extracted from nitrogen, thirty-seven times lighter than hydrogen,"
"x83","reached the moon after a passage of nineteen hours. This journey, like"
"x83","all previous ones, was purely imaginary; still, it was the work of a"
"x83","popular American author—I mean Edgar Poe!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Cheers for Edgar Poe!” roared the assemblage, electrified by their"
"x83","president’s words."
"x83",""
"x83","“I have now enumerated,” said Barbicane, “the experiments which I call"
"x83","purely paper ones, and wholly insufficient to establish serious"
"x83","relations with the Queen of the Night. Nevertheless, I am bound to add"
"x83","that some practical geniuses have attempted to establish actual"
"x83","communication with her. Thus, a few days ago, a German geometrician"
"x83","proposed to send a scientific expedition to the steppes of Siberia."
"x83","There, on those vast plains, they were to describe enormous geometric"
"x83","figures, drawn in characters of reflecting luminosity, among which was"
"x83","the proposition regarding the ‘square of the hypothenuse,’ commonly"
"x83","called the ‘_Ass’s Bridge_’ by the French. ‘Every intelligent being,’"
"x83","said the geometrician, ‘must understand the scientific meaning of that"
"x83","figure. The Selenites, do they exist, will respond by a similar figure;"
"x83","and, a communication being thus once established, it will be easy to"
"x83","form an alphabet which shall enable us to converse with the inhabitants"
"x83","of the moon.’ So spoke the German geometrician; but his project was"
"x83","never put into practice, and up to the present day there is no bond in"
"x83","existence between the Earth and her satellite. It is reserved for the"
"x83","practical genius of Americans to establish a communication with the"
"x83","sidereal world. The means of arriving thither are simple, easy,"
"x83","certain, infallible—and that is the purpose of my present proposal.”"
"x83",""
"x83","A storm of acclamations greeted these words. There was not a single"
"x83","person in the whole audience who was not overcome, carried away, lifted"
"x83","out of himself by the speaker’s words!"
"x83",""
"x83","Long-continued applause resounded from all sides."
"x83",""
"x83","As soon as the excitement had partially subsided, Barbicane resumed his"
"x83","speech in a somewhat graver voice."
"x83",""
"x83","“You know,” said he, “what progress artillery science has made during"
"x83","the last few years, and what a degree of perfection firearms of every"
"x83","kind have reached. Moreover, you are well aware that, in general terms,"
"x83","the resisting power of cannon and the expansive force of gunpowder are"
"x83","practically unlimited. Well! starting from this principle, I ask myself"
"x83","whether, supposing sufficient apparatus could be obtained constructed"
"x83","upon the conditions of ascertained resistance, it might not be possible"
"x83","to project a shot up to the moon?”"
"x83",""
"x83","At these words a murmur of amazement escaped from a thousand panting"
"x83","chests; then succeeded a moment of perfect silence, resembling that"
"x83","profound stillness which precedes the bursting of a thunderstorm. In"
"x83","point of fact, a thunderstorm did peal forth, but it was the thunder of"
"x83","applause, or cries, and of uproar which made the very hall tremble. The"
"x83","president attempted to speak, but could not. It was fully ten minutes"
"x83","before he could make himself heard."
"x83",""
"x83","“Suffer me to finish,” he calmly continued. “I have looked at the"
"x83","question in all its bearings, I have resolutely attacked it, and by"
"x83","incontrovertible calculations I find that a projectile endowed with an"
"x83","initial velocity of 12,000 yards per second, and aimed at the moon,"
"x83","must necessarily reach it. I have the honor, my brave colleagues, to"
"x83","propose a trial of this little experiment.”"

"x83","EFFECT OF THE PRESIDENT’S COMMUNICATION"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","It is impossible to describe the effect produced by the last words of"
"x83","the honorable president—the cries, the shouts, the succession of roars,"
"x83","hurrahs, and all the varied vociferations which the American language"
"x83","is capable of supplying. It was a scene of indescribable confusion and"
"x83","uproar. They shouted, they clapped, they stamped on the floor of the"
"x83","hall. All the weapons in the museum discharged at once could not have"
"x83","more violently set in motion the waves of sound. One need not be"
"x83","surprised at this. There are some cannoneers nearly as noisy as their"
"x83","own guns."
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane remained calm in the midst of this enthusiastic clamor;"
"x83","perhaps he was desirous of addressing a few more words to his"
"x83","colleagues, for by his gestures he demanded silence, and his powerful"
"x83","alarum was worn out by its violent reports. No attention, however, was"
"x83","paid to his request. He was presently torn from his seat and passed"
"x83","from the hands of his faithful colleagues into the arms of a no less"
"x83","excited crowd."
"x83",""
"x83","Nothing can astound an American. It has often been asserted that the"
"x83","word “impossible” is not a French one. People have evidently been"
"x83","deceived by the dictionary. In America, all is easy, all is simple; and"
"x83","as for mechanical difficulties, they are overcome before they arise."
"x83","Between Barbicane’s proposition and its realization no true Yankee"
"x83","would have allowed even the semblance of a difficulty to be possible. A"
"x83","thing with them is no sooner said than done."
"x83",""
"x83","The triumphal progress of the president continued throughout the"
"x83","evening. It was a regular torchlight procession. Irish, Germans,"
"x83","French, Scotch, all the heterogeneous units which make up the"
"x83","population of Maryland shouted in their respective vernaculars; and the"
"x83","“vivas,” “hurrahs,” and “bravos” were intermingled in inexpressible"
"x83","enthusiasm."
"x83",""
"x83","Just at this crisis, as though she comprehended all this agitation"
"x83","regarding herself, the moon shone forth with serene splendor, eclipsing"
"x83","by her intense illumination all the surrounding lights. The Yankees all"
"x83","turned their gaze toward her resplendent orb, kissed their hands,"
"x83","called her by all kinds of endearing names. Between eight o’clock and"
"x83","midnight one optician in Jones’-Fall Street made his fortune by the"
"x83","sale of opera-glasses."
"x83",""
"x83","Midnight arrived, and the enthusiasm showed no signs of diminution. It"
"x83","spread equally among all classes of citizens—men of science,"
"x83","shopkeepers, merchants, porters, chair-men, as well as “greenhorns,”"
"x83","were stirred in their innermost fibres. A national enterprise was at"
"x83","stake. The whole city, high and low, the quays bordering the Patapsco,"
"x83","the ships lying in the basins, disgorged a crowd drunk with joy, gin,"
"x83","and whisky. Every one chattered, argued, discussed, disputed,"
"x83","applauded, from the gentleman lounging upon the barroom settee with his"
"x83","tumbler of sherry-cobbler before him down to the waterman who got drunk"
"x83","upon his “knock-me-down” in the dingy taverns of Fell Point."
"x83",""
"x83","About two A.M., however, the excitement began to subside. President"
"x83","Barbicane reached his house, bruised, crushed, and squeezed almost to a"
"x83","mummy. Hercules could not have resisted a similar outbreak of"
"x83","enthusiasm. The crowd gradually deserted the squares and streets. The"
"x83","four railways from Philadelphia and Washington, Harrisburg and"
"x83","Wheeling, which converge at Baltimore, whirled away the heterogeneous"
"x83","population to the four corners of the United States, and the city"
"x83","subsided into comparative tranquility."
"x83",""
"x83","On the following day, thanks to the telegraphic wires, five hundred"
"x83","newspapers and journals, daily, weekly, monthly, or bi-monthly, all"
"x83","took up the question. They examined it under all its different aspects,"
"x83","physical, meteorological, economical, or moral, up to its bearings on"
"x83","politics or civilization. They debated whether the moon was a finished"
"x83","world, or whether it was destined to undergo any further"
"x83","transformation. Did it resemble the earth at the period when the latter"
"x83","was destitute as yet of an atmosphere? What kind of spectacle would its"
"x83","hidden hemisphere present to our terrestrial spheroid? Granting that"
"x83","the question at present was simply that of sending a projectile up to"
"x83","the moon, every one must see that that involved the commencement of a"
"x83","series of experiments. All must hope that some day America would"
"x83","penetrate the deepest secrets of that mysterious orb; and some even"
"x83","seemed to fear lest its conquest should not sensibly derange the"
"x83","equilibrium of Europe."
"x83",""
"x83","The project once under discussion, not a single paragraph suggested a"
"x83","doubt of its realization. All the papers, pamphlets, reports—all the"
"x83","journals published by the scientific, literary, and religious societies"
"x83","enlarged upon its advantages; and the Society of Natural History of"
"x83","Boston, the Society of Science and Art of Albany, the Geographical and"
"x83","Statistical Society of New York, the Philosophical Society of"
"x83","Philadelphia, and the Smithsonian of Washington sent innumerable"
"x83","letters of congratulation to the Gun Club, together with offers of"
"x83","immediate assistance and money."
"x83",""
"x83","From that day forward Impey Barbicane became one of the greatest"
"x83","citizens of the United States, a kind of Washington of science. A"
"x83","single trait of feeling, taken from many others, will serve to show the"
"x83","point which this homage of a whole people to a single individual"
"x83","attained."
"x83",""
"x83","Some few days after this memorable meeting of the Gun Club, the manager"
"x83","of an English company announced, at the Baltimore theatre, the"
"x83","production of “Much ado about Nothing.” But the populace, seeing in"
"x83","that title an allusion damaging to Barbicane’s project, broke into the"
"x83","auditorium, smashed the benches, and compelled the unlucky director to"
"x83","alter his playbill. Being a sensible man, he bowed to the public will"
"x83","and replaced the offending comedy by “As you like it”; and for many"
"x83","weeks he realized fabulous profits."

"x83","REPLY FROM THE OBSERVATORY OF CAMBRIDGE"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane, however, lost not one moment amid all the enthusiasm of"
"x83","which he had become the object. His first care was to reassemble his"
"x83","colleagues in the board-room of the Gun Club. There, after some"
"x83","discussion, it was agreed to consult the astronomers regarding the"
"x83","astronomical part of the enterprise. Their reply once ascertained, they"
"x83","could then discuss the mechanical means, and nothing should be wanting"
"x83","to ensure the success of this great experiment."
"x83",""
"x83","A note couched in precise terms, containing special interrogatories,"
"x83","was then drawn up and addressed to the Observatory of Cambridge in"
"x83","Massachusetts. This city, where the first university of the United"
"x83","States was founded, is justly celebrated for its astronomical staff."
"x83","There are to be found assembled all the most eminent men of science."
"x83","Here is to be seen at work that powerful telescope which enabled Bond"
"x83","to resolve the nebula of Andromeda, and Clarke to discover the"
"x83","satellite of Sirius. This celebrated institution fully justified on all"
"x83","points the confidence reposed in it by the Gun Club. So, after two"
"x83","days, the reply so impatiently awaited was placed in the hands of"
"x83","President Barbicane."
"x83",""
"x83","It was couched in the following terms:"
"x83",""
"x83","_The Director of the Cambridge Observatory to the President of the Gun"
"x83","Club at Baltimore._"
"x83",""
"x83","CAMBRIDGE, October 7. On the receipt of your favor of the 6th instant,"
"x83","addressed to the Observatory of Cambridge in the name of the members of"
"x83","the Baltimore Gun Club, our staff was immediately called together, and"
"x83","it was judged expedient to reply as follows:"
"x83",""
"x83","The questions which have been proposed to it are these—"
"x83",""
"x83","“1. Is it possible to transmit a projectile up to the moon?"
"x83",""
"x83","“2. What is the exact distance which separates the earth from its"
"x83","satellite?"
"x83",""
"x83","“3. What will be the period of transit of the projectile when endowed"
"x83","with sufficient initial velocity? and, consequently, at what moment"
"x83","ought it to be discharged in order that it may touch the moon at a"
"x83","particular point?"
"x83",""
"x83","“4. At what precise moment will the moon present herself in the most"
"x83","favorable position to be reached by the projectile?"
"x83",""
"x83","“5. What point in the heavens ought the cannon to be aimed at which is"
"x83","intended to discharge the projectile?"
"x83",""
"x83","“6. What place will the moon occupy in the heavens at the moment of the"
"x83","projectile’s departure?”"
"x83",""
"x83","Regarding the _first_ question, “Is it possible to transmit a"
"x83","projectile up to the moon?”"
"x83",""
"x83","_Answer._—Yes; provided it possess an initial velocity of 1,200 yards"
"x83","per second; calculations prove that to be sufficient. In proportion as"
"x83","we recede from the earth the action of gravitation diminishes in the"
"x83","inverse ratio of the square of the distance; that is to say, _at three"
"x83","times a given distance the action is nine times less._ Consequently,"
"x83","the weight of a shot will decrease, and will become reduced to _zero_"
"x83","at the instant that the attraction of the moon exactly counterpoises"
"x83","that of the earth; that is to say at 47/52 of its passage. At that"
"x83","instant the projectile will have no weight whatever; and, if it passes"
"x83","that point, it will fall into the moon by the sole effect of the lunar"
"x83","attraction. The _theoretical possibility_ of the experiment is"
"x83","therefore absolutely demonstrated; its _success_ must depend upon the"
"x83","power of the engine employed."
"x83",""
"x83","As to the _second_ question, “What is the exact distance which"
"x83","separates the earth from its satellite?”"
"x83",""
"x83","_Answer._—The moon does not describe a _circle_ round the earth, but"
"x83","rather an _ellipse_, of which our earth occupies one of the _foci_; the"
"x83","consequence, therefore, is, that at certain times it approaches nearer"
"x83","to, and at others it recedes farther from, the earth; in astronomical"
"x83","language, it is at one time in _apogee_, at another in _perigee_. Now"
"x83","the difference between its greatest and its least distance is too"
"x83","considerable to be left out of consideration. In point of fact, in its"
"x83","apogee the moon is 247,552 miles, and in its perigee, 218,657 miles"
"x83","only distant; a fact which makes a difference of 28,895 miles, or more"
"x83","than one-ninth of the entire distance. The perigee distance, therefore,"
"x83","is that which ought to serve as the basis of all calculations."
"x83",""
"x83","To the _third_ question:—"
"x83",""
"x83","_Answer._—If the shot should preserve continuously its initial velocity"
"x83","of 12,000 yards per second, it would require little more than nine"
"x83","hours to reach its destination; but, inasmuch as that initial velocity"
"x83","will be continually decreasing, it will occupy 300,000 seconds, that is"
"x83","83hrs. 20m. in reaching the point where the attraction of the earth and"
"x83","moon will be _in equilibrio_. From this point it will fall into the"
"x83","moon in 50,000 seconds, or 13hrs. 53m. 20sec. It will be desirable,"
"x83","therefore, to discharge it 97hrs. 13m. 20sec. before the arrival of the"
"x83","moon at the point aimed at."
"x83",""
"x83","Regarding question _four_, “At what precise moment will the moon"
"x83","present herself in the most favorable position, etc.?”"
"x83",""
"x83","_Answer._—After what has been said above, it will be necessary, first"
"x83","of all, to choose the period when the moon will be in perigee, and"
"x83","_also_ the moment when she will be crossing the zenith, which latter"
"x83","event will further diminish the entire distance by a length equal to"
"x83","the radius of the earth, _i. e._ 3,919 miles; the result of which will"
"x83","be that the final passage remaining to be accomplished will be 214,976"
"x83","miles. But although the moon passes her perigee every month, she does"
"x83","not reach the zenith always _at exactly the same moment_. She does not"
"x83","appear under these two conditions simultaneously, except at long"
"x83","intervals of time. It will be necessary, therefore, to wait for the"
"x83","moment when her passage in perigee shall coincide with that in the"
"x83","zenith. Now, by a fortunate circumstance, on the 4th of December in the"
"x83","ensuing year the moon _will_ present these two conditions. At midnight"
"x83","she will be in perigee, that is, at her shortest distance from the"
"x83","earth, and at the same moment she will be crossing the zenith."
"x83",""
"x83","On the _fifth_ question, “At what point in the heavens ought the cannon"
"x83","to be aimed?”"
"x83",""
"x83","_Answer._—The preceding remarks being admitted, the cannon ought to be"
"x83","pointed to the zenith of the place. Its fire, therefore, will be"
"x83","perpendicular to the plane of the horizon; and the projectile will"
"x83","soonest pass beyond the range of the terrestrial attraction. But, in"
"x83","order that the moon should reach the zenith of a given place, it is"
"x83","necessary that the place should not exceed in latitude the declination"
"x83","of the luminary; in other words, it must be comprised within the"
"x83","degrees 0° and 28° of lat. N. or S. In every other spot the fire must"
"x83","necessarily be oblique, which would seriously militate against the"
"x83","success of the experiment."
"x83",""
"x83","As to the _sixth_ question, “What place will the moon occupy in the"
"x83","heavens at the moment of the projectile’s departure?”"
"x83",""
"x83","_Answer._—At the moment when the projectile shall be discharged into"
"x83","space, the moon, which travels daily forward 13° 10′ 35″, will be"
"x83","distant from the zenith point by four times that quantity, _i. e._ by"
"x83","52° 41′ 20″, a space which corresponds to the path which she will"
"x83","describe during the entire journey of the projectile. But, inasmuch as"
"x83","it is equally necessary to take into account the deviation which the"
"x83","rotary motion of the earth will impart to the shot, and as the shot"
"x83","cannot reach the moon until after a deviation equal to 16 radii of the"
"x83","earth, which, calculated upon the moon’s orbit, are equal to about"
"x83","eleven degrees, it becomes necessary to add these eleven degrees to"
"x83","those which express the retardation of the moon just mentioned: that is"
"x83","to say, in round numbers, about sixty-four degrees. Consequently, at"
"x83","the moment of firing the visual radius applied to the moon will"
"x83","describe, with the vertical line of the place, an angle of sixty-four"
"x83","degrees."
"x83",""
"x83","These are our answers to the questions proposed to the Observatory of"
"x83","Cambridge by the members of the Gun Club:—"
"x83",""
"x83","To sum up—"
"x83",""
"x83","1st. The cannon ought to be planted in a country situated between 0°"
"x83","and 28° of N. or S. lat."
"x83",""
"x83","2nd. It ought to be pointed directly toward the zenith of the place."
"x83",""
"x83","3rd. The projectile ought to be propelled with an initial velocity of"
"x83","12,000 yards per second."
"x83",""
"x83","4th. It ought to be discharged at 10hrs. 46m. 40sec. of the 1st of"
"x83","December of the ensuing year."
"x83",""
"x83","5th. It will meet the moon four days after its discharge, precisely at"
"x83","midnight on the 4th of December, at the moment of its transit across"
"x83","the zenith."
"x83",""
"x83","The members of the Gun Club ought, therefore, without delay, to"
"x83","commence the works necessary for such an experiment, and to be prepared"
"x83","to set to work at the moment determined upon; for, if they should"
"x83","suffer this 4th of December to go by, they will not find the moon again"
"x83","under the same conditions of perigee and of zenith until eighteen years"
"x83","and eleven days afterward."
"x83",""
"x83","The staff of the Cambridge Observatory place themselves entirely at"
"x83","their disposal in respect of all questions of theoretical astronomy;"
"x83","and herewith add their congratulations to those of all the rest of"
"x83","America. For the Astronomical Staff, J. M. BELFAST, _Director of the"

"x83","CHAPTER V."
"x83","THE ROMANCE OF THE MOON"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","An observer endued with an infinite range of vision, and placed in that"
"x83","unknown center around which the entire world revolves, might have"
"x83","beheld myriads of atoms filling all space during the chaotic epoch of"
"x83","the universe. Little by little, as ages went on, a change took place; a"
"x83","general law of attraction manifested itself, to which the hitherto"
"x83","errant atoms became obedient: these atoms combined together chemically"
"x83","according to their affinities, formed themselves into molecules, and"
"x83","composed those nebulous masses with which the depths of the heavens are"
"x83","strewed. These masses became immediately endued with a rotary motion"
"x83","around their own central point. This center, formed of indefinite"
"x83","molecules, began to revolve around its own axis during its gradual"
"x83","condensation; then, following the immutable laws of mechanics, in"
"x83","proportion as its bulk diminished by condensation, its rotary motion"
"x83","became accelerated, and these two effects continuing, the result was"
"x83","the formation of one principal star, the center of the nebulous mass."
"x83",""
"x83","By attentively watching, the observer would then have perceived the"
"x83","other molecules of the mass, following the example of this central"
"x83","star, become likewise condensed by gradually accelerated rotation, and"
"x83","gravitating round it in the shape of innumerable stars. Thus was formed"
"x83","the _Nebulæ_, of which astronomers have reckoned up nearly 5,000."
"x83",""
"x83","Among these 5,000 nebulæ there is one which has received the name of"
"x83","the Milky Way, and which contains eighteen millions of stars, each of"
"x83","which has become the center of a solar world."
"x83",""
"x83","If the observer had then specially directed his attention to one of the"
"x83","more humble and less brilliant of these stellar bodies, a star of the"
"x83","fourth class, that which is arrogantly called the Sun, all the"
"x83","phenomena to which the formation of the Universe is to be ascribed"
"x83","would have been successively fulfilled before his eyes. In fact, he"
"x83","would have perceived this sun, as yet in the gaseous state, and"
"x83","composed of moving molecules, revolving round its axis in order to"
"x83","accomplish its work of concentration. This motion, faithful to the laws"
"x83","of mechanics, would have been accelerated with the diminution of its"
"x83","volume; and a moment would have arrived when the centrifugal force"
"x83","would have overpowered the centripetal, which causes the molecules all"
"x83","to tend toward the center."
"x83",""
"x83","Another phenomenon would now have passed before the observer’s eye, and"
"x83","the molecules situated on the plane of the equator, escaping like a"
"x83","stone from a sling of which the cord had suddenly snapped, would have"
"x83","formed around the sun sundry concentric rings resembling that of"
"x83","Saturn. In their turn, again, these rings of cosmical matter, excited"
"x83","by a rotary motion about the central mass, would have been broken up"
"x83","and decomposed into secondary nebulosities, that is to say, into"
"x83","planets. Similarly he would have observed these planets throw off one"
"x83","or more rings each, which became the origin of the secondary bodies"
"x83","which we call satellites."
"x83",""
"x83","Thus, then, advancing from atom to molecule, from molecule to nebulous"
"x83","mass, from that to principal star, from star to sun, from sun to"
"x83","planet, and hence to satellite, we have the whole series of"
"x83","transformations undergone by the heavenly bodies during the first days"
"x83","of the world."
"x83",""
"x83","Now, of those attendant bodies which the sun maintains in their"
"x83","elliptical orbits by the great law of gravitation, some few in turn"
"x83","possess satellites. Uranus has eight, Saturn eight, Jupiter four,"
"x83","Neptune possibly three, and the Earth one. This last, one of the least"
"x83","important of the entire solar system, we call the Moon; and it is she"
"x83","whom the daring genius of the Americans professed their intention of"
"x83","conquering."
"x83",""
"x83","The moon, by her comparative proximity, and the constantly varying"
"x83","appearances produced by her several phases, has always occupied a"
"x83","considerable share of the attention of the inhabitants of the earth."
"x83",""
"x83","From the time of Thales of Miletus, in the fifth century B.C., down to"
"x83","that of Copernicus in the fifteenth and Tycho Brahé in the sixteenth"
"x83","century A.D., observations have been from time to time carried on with"
"x83","more or less correctness, until in the present day the altitudes of the"
"x83","lunar mountains have been determined with exactitude. Galileo explained"
"x83","the phenomena of the lunar light produced during certain of her phases"
"x83","by the existence of mountains, to which he assigned a mean altitude of"
"x83","27,000 feet. After him Hévelius, an astronomer of Dantzic, reduced the"
"x83","highest elevations to 15,000 feet; but the calculations of Riccioli"
"x83","brought them up again to 21,000 feet."
"x83",""
"x83","At the close of the eighteenth century Herschel, armed with a powerful"
"x83","telescope, considerably reduced the preceding measurements. He assigned"
"x83","a height of 11,400 feet to the maximum elevations, and reduced the mean"
"x83","of the different altitudes to little more than 2,400 feet. But"
"x83","Herschel’s calculations were in their turn corrected by the"
"x83","observations of Halley, Nasmyth, Bianchini, Gruithuysen, and others;"
"x83","but it was reserved for the labors of Boeer and Maedler finally to"
"x83","solve the question. They succeeded in measuring 1,905 different"
"x83","elevations, of which six exceed 15,000 feet, and twenty-two exceed"
"x83","14,400 feet. The highest summit of all towers to a height of 22,606"
"x83","feet above the surface of the lunar disc. At the same period the"
"x83","examination of the moon was completed. She appeared completely riddled"
"x83","with craters, and her essentially volcanic character was apparent at"
"x83","each observation. By the absence of refraction in the rays of the"
"x83","planets occulted by her we conclude that she is absolutely devoid of an"
"x83","atmosphere. The absence of air entails the absence of water. It became,"
"x83","therefore, manifest that the Selenites, to support life under such"
"x83","conditions, must possess a special organization of their own, must"
"x83","differ remarkably from the inhabitants of the earth."
"x83",""
"x83","At length, thanks to modern art, instruments of still higher perfection"
"x83","searched the moon without intermission, not leaving a single point of"
"x83","her surface unexplored; and notwithstanding that her diameter measures"
"x83","2,150 miles, her surface equals the one-fifteenth part of that of our"
"x83","globe, and her bulk the one-forty-ninth part of that of the terrestrial"
"x83","spheroid—not one of her secrets was able to escape the eyes of the"
"x83","astronomers; and these skillful men of science carried to an even"
"x83","greater degree their prodigious observations."
"x83",""
"x83","Thus they remarked that, during full moon, the disc appeared scored in"
"x83","certain parts with white lines; and, during the phases, with black. On"
"x83","prosecuting the study of these with still greater precision, they"
"x83","succeeded in obtaining an exact account of the nature of these lines."
"x83","They were long and narrow furrows sunk between parallel ridges,"
"x83","bordering generally upon the edges of the craters. Their length varied"
"x83","between ten and 100 miles, and their width was about 1,600 yards."
"x83","Astronomers called them chasms, but they could not get any further."
"x83","Whether these chasms were the dried-up beds of ancient rivers or not"
"x83","they were unable thoroughly to ascertain."
"x83",""
"x83","The Americans, among others, hoped one day or other to determine this"
"x83","geological question. They also undertook to examine the true nature of"
"x83","that system of parallel ramparts discovered on the moon’s surface by"
"x83","Gruithuysen, a learned professor of Munich, who considered them to be"
"x83","“a system of fortifications thrown up by the Selenitic engineers.”"
"x83","These two points, yet obscure, as well as others, no doubt, could not"
"x83","be definitely settled except by direct communication with the moon."
"x83",""
"x83","Regarding the degree of intensity of its light, there was nothing more"
"x83","to learn on this point. It was known that it is 300,000 times weaker"
"x83","than that of the sun, and that its heat has no appreciable effect upon"
"x83","the thermometer. As to the phenomenon known as the “ashy light,” it is"
"x83","explained naturally by the effect of the transmission of the solar rays"
"x83","from the earth to the moon, which give the appearance of completeness"
"x83","to the lunar disc, while it presents itself under the crescent form"
"x83","during its first and last phases."
"x83",""
"x83","Such was the state of knowledge acquired regarding the earth’s"
"x83","satellite, which the Gun Club undertook to perfect in all its aspects,"
"x83","cosmographic, geological, political, and moral."

"x83","CHAPTER VI."
"x83","PERMISSIVE LIMITS OF IGNORANCE AND BELIEF IN THE UNITED STATES"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","The immediate result of Barbicane’s proposition was to place upon the"
"x83","orders of the day all the astronomical facts relative to the Queen of"
"x83","the Night. Everybody set to work to study assiduously. One would have"
"x83","thought that the moon had just appeared for the first time, and that no"
"x83","one had ever before caught a glimpse of her in the heavens. The papers"
"x83","revived all the old anecdotes in which the “sun of the wolves” played a"
"x83","part; they recalled the influences which the ignorance of past ages"
"x83","ascribed to her; in short, all America was seized with selenomania, or"
"x83","had become moon-mad."
"x83",""
"x83","The scientific journals, for their part, dealt more especially with the"
"x83","questions which touched upon the enterprise of the Gun Club. The letter"
"x83","of the Observatory of Cambridge was published by them, and commented"
"x83","upon with unreserved approval."
"x83",""
"x83","Until that time most people had been ignorant of the mode in which the"
"x83","distance which separates the moon from the earth is calculated. They"
"x83","took advantage of this fact to explain to them that this distance was"
"x83","obtained by measuring the parallax of the moon. The term parallax"
"x83","proving “caviare to the general,” they further explained that it meant"
"x83","the angle formed by the inclination of two straight lines drawn from"
"x83","either extremity of the earth’s radius to the moon. On doubts being"
"x83","expressed as to the correctness of this method, they immediately proved"
"x83","that not only was the mean distance 234,347 miles, but that astronomers"
"x83","could not possibly be in error in their estimate by more than seventy"
"x83","miles either way."
"x83",""
"x83","To those who were not familiar with the motions of the moon, they"
"x83","demonstrated that she possesses two distinct motions, the first being"
"x83","that of rotation upon her axis, the second being that of revolution"
"x83","round the earth, accomplishing both together in an equal period of"
"x83","time, that is to say, in twenty-seven and one-third days."
"x83",""
"x83","The motion of rotation is that which produces day and night on the"
"x83","surface of the moon; save that there is only one day and one night in"
"x83","the lunar month, each lasting three hundred and fifty-four and"
"x83","one-third hours. But, happily for her, the face turned toward the"
"x83","terrestrial globe is illuminated by it with an intensity equal to that"
"x83","of fourteen moons. As to the other face, always invisible to us, it has"
"x83","of necessity three hundred and fifty-four hours of absolute night,"
"x83","tempered only by that “pale glimmer which falls upon it from the"
"x83","stars.”"
"x83",""
"x83","Some well-intentioned, but rather obstinate persons, could not at first"
"x83","comprehend how, if the moon displays invariably the same face to the"
"x83","earth during her revolution, she can describe one turn round herself."
"x83","To such they answered, “Go into your dining-room, and walk round the"
"x83","table in such a way as to always keep your face turned toward the"
"x83","center; by the time you will have achieved one complete round you will"
"x83","have completed one turn around yourself, since your eye will have"
"x83","traversed successively every point of the room. Well, then, the room is"
"x83","the heavens, the table is the earth, and the moon is yourself.” And"
"x83","they would go away delighted."
"x83",""
"x83","So, then the moon displays invariably the same face to the earth;"
"x83","nevertheless, to be quite exact, it is necessary to add that, in"
"x83","consequence of certain fluctuations of north and south, and of west and"
"x83","east, termed her libration, she permits rather more than half, that is"
"x83","to say, five-sevenths, to be seen."
"x83",""
"x83","As soon as the ignoramuses came to understand as much as the director"
"x83","of the observatory himself knew, they began to worry themselves"
"x83","regarding her revolution round the earth, whereupon twenty scientific"
"x83","reviews immediately came to the rescue. They pointed out to them that"
"x83","the firmament, with its infinitude of stars, may be considered as one"
"x83","vast dial-plate, upon which the moon travels, indicating the true time"
"x83","to all the inhabitants of the earth; that it is during this movement"
"x83","that the Queen of Night exhibits her different phases; that the moon is"
"x83","_full_ when she is in _opposition_ with the sun, that is when the three"
"x83","bodies are on the same straight line, the earth occupying the center;"
"x83","that she is _new_ when she is in _conjunction_ with the sun, that is,"
"x83","when she is between it and the earth; and, lastly that she is in her"
"x83","_first_ or _last_ quarter, when she makes with the sun and the earth an"
"x83","angle of which she herself occupies the apex."
"x83",""
"x83","Regarding the altitude which the moon attains above the horizon, the"
"x83","letter of the Cambridge Observatory had said all that was to be said in"
"x83","this respect. Every one knew that this altitude varies according to the"
"x83","latitude of the observer. But the only zones of the globe in which the"
"x83","moon passes the zenith, that is, the point directly over the head of"
"x83","the spectator, are of necessity comprised between the twenty-eighth"
"x83","parallels and the equator. Hence the importance of the advice to try"
"x83","the experiment upon some point of that part of the globe, in order that"
"x83","the projectile might be discharged perpendicularly, and so the soonest"
"x83","escape the action of gravitation. This was an essential condition to"
"x83","the success of the enterprise, and continued actively to engage the"
"x83","public attention."
"x83",""
"x83","Regarding the path described by the moon in her revolution round the"
"x83","earth, the Cambridge Observatory had demonstrated that this path is a"
"x83","re-entering curve, not a perfect circle, but an ellipse, of which the"
"x83","earth occupies one of the _foci_. It was also well understood that it"
"x83","is farthest removed from the earth during its _apogee_, and approaches"
"x83","most nearly to it at its _perigee_."
"x83",""
"x83","Such was then the extent of knowledge possessed by every American on"
"x83","the subject, and of which no one could decently profess ignorance."
"x83","Still, while these principles were being rapidly disseminated many"
"x83","errors and illusory fears proved less easy to eradicate."
"x83",""
"x83","For instance, some worthy persons maintained that the moon was an"
"x83","ancient comet which, in describing its elongated orbit round the sun,"
"x83","happened to pass near the earth, and became confined within her circle"
"x83","of attraction. These drawing-room astronomers professed to explain the"
"x83","charred aspect of the moon—a disaster which they attributed to the"
"x83","intensity of the solar heat; only, on being reminded that comets have"
"x83","an atmosphere, and that the moon has little or none, they were fairly"
"x83","at a loss for a reply."
"x83",""
"x83","Others again, belonging to the doubting class, expressed certain fears"
"x83","as to the position of the moon. They had heard it said that, according"
"x83","to observations made in the time of the Caliphs, her revolution had"
"x83","become accelerated in a certain degree. Hence they concluded, logically"
"x83","enough, that an acceleration of motion ought to be accompanied by a"
"x83","corresponding diminution in the distance separating the two bodies; and"
"x83","that, supposing the double effect to be continued to infinity, the moon"
"x83","would end by one day falling into the earth. However, they became"
"x83","reassured as to the fate of future generations on being apprised that,"
"x83","according to the calculations of Laplace, this acceleration of motion"
"x83","is confined within very restricted limits, and that a proportional"
"x83","diminution of speed will be certain to succeed it. So, then, the"
"x83","stability of the solar system would not be deranged in ages to come."
"x83",""
"x83","There remains but the third class, the superstitious. These worthies"
"x83","were not content merely to rest in ignorance; they must know all about"
"x83","things which had no existence whatever, and as to the moon, they had"
"x83","long known all about her. One set regarded her disc as a polished"
"x83","mirror, by means of which people could see each other from different"
"x83","points of the earth and interchange their thoughts. Another set"
"x83","pretended that out of one thousand new moons that had been observed,"
"x83","nine hundred and fifty had been attended with remarkable disturbances,"
"x83","such as cataclysms, revolutions, earthquakes, the deluge, etc. Then"
"x83","they believed in some mysterious influence exercised by her over human"
"x83","destinies—that every Selenite was attached to some inhabitant of the"
"x83","earth by a tie of sympathy; they maintained that the entire vital"
"x83","system is subject to her control, etc. But in time the majority"
"x83","renounced these vulgar errors, and espoused the true side of the"
"x83","question. As for the Yankees, they had no other ambition than to take"
"x83","possession of this new continent of the sky, and to plant upon the"
"x83","summit of its highest elevation the star- spangled banner of the United"
"x83","States of America."

"x83","THE HYMN OF THE CANNON-BALL"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","The Observatory of Cambridge in its memorable letter had treated the"
"x83","question from a purely astronomical point of view. The mechanical part"
"x83","still remained."
"x83",""
"x83","President Barbicane had, without loss of time, nominated a working"
"x83","committee of the Gun Club. The duty of this committee was to resolve"
"x83","the three grand questions of the cannon, the projectile, and the"
"x83","powder. It was composed of four members of great technical knowledge,"
"x83","Barbicane (with a casting vote in case of equality), General Morgan,"
"x83","Major Elphinstone, and J. T. Maston, to whom were confided the"
"x83","functions of secretary. On the 8th of October the committee met at the"
"x83","house of President Barbicane, 3 Republican Street. The meeting was"
"x83","opened by the president himself."
"x83",""
"x83","“Gentlemen,” said he, “we have to resolve one of the most important"
"x83","problems in the whole of the noble science of gunnery. It might appear,"
"x83","perhaps, the most logical course to devote our first meeting to the"
"x83","discussion of the engine to be employed. Nevertheless, after mature"
"x83","consideration, it has appeared to me that the question of the"
"x83","projectile must take precedence of that of the cannon, and that the"
"x83","dimensions of the latter must necessarily depend on those of the"
"x83","former.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Suffer me to say a word,” here broke in J. T. Maston. Permission"
"x83","having been granted, “Gentlemen,” said he with an inspired accent, “our"
"x83","president is right in placing the question of the projectile above all"
"x83","others. The ball we are about to discharge at the moon is our"
"x83","ambassador to her, and I wish to consider it from a moral point of"
"x83","view. The cannon-ball, gentlemen, to my mind, is the most magnificent"
"x83","manifestation of human power. If Providence has created the stars and"
"x83","the planets, man has called the cannon-ball into existence. Let"
"x83","Providence claim the swiftness of electricity and of light, of the"
"x83","stars, the comets, and the planets, of wind and sound—we claim to have"
"x83","invented the swiftness of the cannon-ball, a hundred times superior to"
"x83","that of the swiftest horses or railway train. How glorious will be the"
"x83","moment when, infinitely exceeding all hitherto attained velocities, we"
"x83","shall launch our new projectile with the rapidity of seven miles a"
"x83","second! Shall it not, gentlemen—shall it not be received up there with"
"x83","the honors due to a terrestrial ambassador?”"
"x83",""
"x83","Overcome with emotion the orator sat down and applied himself to a huge"
"x83","plate of sandwiches before him."
"x83",""
"x83","“And now,” said Barbicane, “let us quit the domain of poetry and come"
"x83","direct to the question.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“By all means,” replied the members, each with his mouth full of"
"x83","sandwich."
"x83",""
"x83","“The problem before us,” continued the president, “is how to"
"x83","communicate to a projectile a velocity of 12,000 yards per second. Let"
"x83","us at present examine the velocities hitherto attained. General Morgan"
"x83","will be able to enlighten us on this point.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“And the more easily,” replied the general, “that during the war I was"
"x83","a member of the committee of experiments. I may say, then, that the"
"x83","100-pounder Dahlgrens, which carried a distance of 5,000 yards,"
"x83","impressed upon their projectile an initial velocity of 500 yards a"
"x83","second. The Rodman Columbiad threw a shot weighing half a ton a"
"x83","distance of six miles, with a velocity of 800 yards per second—a result"
"x83","which Armstrong and Palisser have never obtained in England.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“This,” replied Barbicane, “is, I believe, the maximum velocity ever"

"x83","“Ah!” groaned J. T. Maston, “if my mortar had not burst—”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes,” quietly replied Barbicane, “but it did burst. We must take,"
"x83","then, for our starting point, this velocity of 800 yards. We must"
"x83","increase it twenty-fold. Now, reserving for another discussion the"
"x83","means of producing this velocity, I will call your attention to the"
"x83","dimensions which it will be proper to assign to the shot. You"
"x83","understand that we have nothing to do here with projectiles weighing at"
"x83","most but half a ton.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Why not?” demanded the major."
"x83",""
"x83","“Because the shot,” quickly replied J. T. Maston, “must be big enough"
"x83","to attract the attention of the inhabitants of the moon, if there are"
"x83","any?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes,” replied Barbicane, “and for another reason more important"
"x83","still.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“What mean you?” asked the major."
"x83",""
"x83","“I mean that it is not enough to discharge a projectile, and then take"
"x83","no further notice of it; we must follow it throughout its course, up to"
"x83","the moment when it shall reach its goal.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“What?” shouted the general and the major in great surprise."
"x83",""
"x83","“Undoubtedly,” replied Barbicane composedly, “or our experiment would"
"x83","produce no result.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“But then,” replied the major, “you will have to give this projectile"
"x83","enormous dimensions.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“No! Be so good as to listen. You know that optical instruments have"
"x83","acquired great perfection; with certain instruments we have succeeded"
"x83","in obtaining enlargements of 6,000 times and reducing the moon to"
"x83","within forty miles’ distance. Now, at this distance, any objects sixty"
"x83","feet square would be perfectly visible."
"x83",""
"x83","“If, then, the penetrative power of telescopes has not been further"
"x83","increased, it is because that power detracts from their light; and the"

"x83","light to enable us to perceive objects of lesser magnitude.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Well, then, what do you propose to do?” asked the general. “Would you"
"x83","give your projectile a diameter of sixty feet?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Not so.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Do you intend, then, to increase the luminous power of the moon?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Exactly so. If I can succeed in diminishing the density of the"
"x83","atmosphere through which the moon’s light has to travel I shall have"
"x83","rendered her light more intense. To effect that object it will be"
"x83","enough to establish a telescope on some elevated mountain. That is what"
"x83","we will do.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“I give it up,” answered the major. “You have such a way of simplifying"
"x83","things. And what enlargement do you expect to obtain in this way?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“One of 48,000 times, which should bring the moon within an apparent"
"x83","distance of five miles; and, in order to be visible, objects need not"
"x83","have a diameter of more than nine feet.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“So, then,” cried J. T. Maston, “our projectile need not be more than"
"x83","nine feet in diameter.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Let me observe, however,” interrupted Major Elphinstone, “this will"
"x83","involve a weight such as—”"
"x83",""
"x83","“My dear major,” replied Barbicane, “before discussing its weight"
"x83","permit me to enumerate some of the marvels which our ancestors have"
"x83","achieved in this respect. I don’t mean to pretend that the science of"
"x83","gunnery has not advanced, but it is as well to bear in mind that during"
"x83","the middle ages they obtained results more surprising, I will venture"
"x83","to say, than ours. For instance, during the siege of Constantinople by"
"x83","Mahomet II., in 1453, stone shot of 1,900 pounds weight were employed."
"x83","At Malta, in the time of the knights, there was a gun of the fortress"
"x83","of St. Elmo which threw a projectile weighing 2,500 pounds. And, now,"
"x83","what is the extent of what we have seen ourselves? Armstrong guns"
"x83","discharging shot of 500 pounds, and the Rodman guns projectiles of half"
"x83","a ton! It seems, then, that if projectiles have gained in range, they"
"x83","have lost far more in weight. Now, if we turn our efforts in that"
"x83","direction, we ought to arrive, with the progress on science, at ten"
"x83","times the weight of the shot of Mahomet II. and the Knights of Malta.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Clearly,” replied the major; “but what metal do you calculate upon"
"x83","employing?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Simply cast iron,” said General Morgan."
"x83",""
"x83","“But,” interrupted the major, “since the weight of a shot is"
"x83","proportionate to its volume, an iron ball of nine feet in diameter"
"x83","would be of tremendous weight.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes, if it were solid, not if it were hollow.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Hollow? then it would be a shell?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes, a shell,” replied Barbicane; “decidely it must be. A solid shot"
"x83","of 108 inches would weigh more than 200,000 pounds, a weight evidently"
"x83","far too great. Still, as we must reserve a certain stability for our"
"x83","projectile, I propose to give it a weight of 20,000 pounds.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“What, then, will be the thickness of the sides?” asked the major."
"x83",""
"x83","“If we follow the usual proportion,” replied Morgan, “a diameter of 108"
"x83","inches would require sides of two feet thickness, or less.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“That would be too much,” replied Barbicane; “for you will observe that"
"x83","the question is not that of a shot intended to pierce an iron plate; it"
"x83","will suffice to give it sides strong enough to resist the pressure of"
"x83","the gas. The problem, therefore, is this—What thickness ought a"
"x83","cast-iron shell to have in order not to weight more than 20,000 pounds?"
"x83","Our clever secretary will soon enlighten us upon this point.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Nothing easier.” replied the worthy secretary of the committee; and,"
"x83","rapidly tracing a few algebraical formulae upon paper, among which _n_2"
"x83","and _x_2 frequently appeared, he presently said:"
"x83",""

"x83","“What is to be done, then?” said Elphinstone, with a puzzled air."
"x83",""
"x83","“Employ another metal instead of iron.”"

"x83","“Aluminum?” cried his three colleagues in chorus."
"x83",""
"x83","“Unquestionably, my friends. This valuable metal possesses the"
"x83","whiteness of silver, the indestructibility of gold, the tenacity of"
"x83","iron, the fusibility of copper, the lightness of glass. It is easily"
"x83","wrought, is very widely distributed, forming the base of most of the"
"x83","rocks, is three times lighter than iron, and seems to have been created"
"x83","for the express purpose of furnishing us with the material for our"
"x83","projectile.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“But, my dear president,” said the major, “is not the cost price of"
"x83","aluminum extremely high?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“It was so at its first discovery, but it has fallen now to nine"
"x83","dollars a pound.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“But still, nine dollars a pound!” replied the major, who was not"
"x83","willing readily to give in; “even that is an enormous price.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Undoubtedly, my dear major; but not beyond our reach.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“What will the projectile weigh then?” asked Morgan."
"x83",""
"x83","“Here is the result of my calculations,” replied Barbicane. “A shot of"
"x83","108 inches in diameter, and twelve inches in thickness, would weigh, in"
"x83","cast-iron, 67,440 pounds; cast in aluminum, its weight will be reduced"
"x83","to 19,250 pounds.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Capital!” cried the major; “but do you know that, at nine dollars a"

"x83",""
"x83","“One hundred and seventy-three thousand and fifty dollars ($173,050). I"

"x83","HISTORY OF THE CANNON"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","The resolutions passed at the last meeting produced a great effect out"
"x83","of doors. Timid people took fright at the idea of a shot weighing"
"x83","20,000 pounds being launched into space; they asked what cannon could"
"x83","ever transmit a sufficient velocity to such a mighty mass. The minutes"
"x83","of the second meeting were destined triumphantly to answer such"
"x83","questions. The following evening the discussion was renewed."
"x83",""
"x83","“My dear colleagues,” said Barbicane, without further preamble, “the"
"x83","subject now before us is the construction of the engine, its length,"
"x83","its composition, and its weight. It is probable that we shall end by"
"x83","giving it gigantic dimensions; but however great may be the"
"x83","difficulties in the way, our mechanical genius will readily surmount"
"x83","them. Be good enough, then, to give me your attention, and do not"
"x83","hesitate to make objections at the close. I have no fear of them. The"
"x83","problem before us is how to communicate an initial force of 12,000"
"x83","yards per second to a shell of 108 inches in diameter, weighing 20,000"
"x83","pounds. Now when a projectile is launched into space, what happens to"
"x83","it? It is acted upon by three independent forces: the resistance of the"
"x83","air, the attraction of the earth, and the force of impulsion with which"
"x83","it is endowed. Let us examine these three forces. The resistance of the"
"x83","air is of little importance. The atmosphere of the earth does not"
"x83","exceed forty miles. Now, with the given rapidity, the projectile will"
"x83","have traversed this in five seconds, and the period is too brief for"
"x83","the resistance of the medium to be regarded otherwise than as"
"x83","insignificant. Proceding, then, to the attraction of the earth, that"
"x83","is, the weight of the shell, we know that this weight will diminish in"
"x83","the inverse ratio of the square of the distance. When a body left to"
"x83","itself falls to the surface of the earth, it falls five feet in the"
"x83","first second; and if the same body were removed 257,542 miles further"
"x83","off, in other words, to the distance of the moon, its fall would be"
"x83","reduced to about half a line in the first second. That is almost"
"x83","equivalent to a state of perfect rest. Our business, then, is to"
"x83","overcome progressively this action of gravitation. The mode of"
"x83","accomplishing that is by the force of impulsion.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“There’s the difficulty,” broke in the major."
"x83",""
"x83","“True,” replied the president; “but we will overcome that, for the"
"x83","force of impulsion will depend on the length of the engine and the"
"x83","powder employed, the latter being limited only by the resisting power"
"x83","of the former. Our business, then, to-day is with the dimensions of the"
"x83","cannon.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Now, up to the present time,” said Barbicane, “our longest guns have"
"x83","not exceeded twenty-five feet in length. We shall therefore astonish"
"x83","the world by the dimensions we shall be obliged to adopt. It must"
"x83","evidently be, then, a gun of great range, since the length of the piece"
"x83","will increase the detention of the gas accumulated behind the"
"x83","projectile; but there is no advantage in passing certain limits.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Quite so,” said the major. “What is the rule in such a case?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Ordinarily the length of a gun is twenty to twenty-five times the"
"x83","diameter of the shot, and its weight two hundred and thirty-five to two"
"x83","hundred and forty times that of the shot.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“That is not enough,” cried J. T. Maston impetuously."
"x83",""
"x83","“I agree with you, my good friend; and, in fact, following this"
"x83","proportion for a projectile nine feet in diameter, weighing 30,000"
"x83","pounds, the gun would only have a length of two hundred and twenty-"
"x83","five feet, and a weight of 7,200,000 pounds.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Ridiculous!” rejoined Maston. “As well take a pistol.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“I think so too,” replied Barbicane; “that is why I propose to"
"x83","quadruple that length, and to construct a gun of nine hundred feet.”"
"x83",""
"x83","The general and the major offered some objections; nevertheless, the"
"x83","proposition, actively supported by the secretary, was definitely"
"x83","adopted."
"x83",""
"x83","“But,” said Elphinstone, “what thickness must we give it?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“A thickness of six feet,” replied Barbicane."
"x83",""
"x83","“You surely don’t think of mounting a mass like that upon a carriage?”"
"x83","asked the major."
"x83",""
"x83","“It would be a superb idea, though,” said Maston."
"x83",""
"x83","“But impracticable,” replied Barbicane. “No, I think of sinking this"
"x83","engine in the earth alone, binding it with hoops of wrought iron, and"
"x83","finally surrounding it with a thick mass of masonry of stone and"
"x83","cement. The piece once cast, it must be bored with great precision, so"
"x83","as to preclude any possible windage. So there will be no loss whatever"
"x83","of gas, and all the expansive force of the powder will be employed in"
"x83","the propulsion.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“One simple question,” said Elphinstone: “is our gun to be rifled?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“No, certainly not,” replied Barbicane; “we require an enormous initial"
"x83","velocity; and you are well aware that a shot quits a rifled gun less"
"x83","rapidly than it does a smooth-bore.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“True,” rejoined the major."

"x83","The committee here adjourned for a few minutes to tea and sandwiches."

"x83","On the discussion being renewed, “Gentlemen,” said Barbicane, “we must"
"x83","now take into consideration the metal to be employed. Our cannon must"
"x83","be possessed of great tenacity, great hardness, be infusible by heat,"
"x83","indissoluble, and inoxidable by the corrosive action of acids.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“There is no doubt about that,” replied the major; “and as we shall"

"x83","for choice.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Well, then,” said Morgan, “I propose the best alloy hitherto known,"
"x83","which consists of one hundred parts of copper, twelve of tin, and six"
"x83","of brass.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“I admit,” replied the president, “that this composition has yielded"
"x83","excellent results, but in the present case it would be too expensive,"
"x83","and very difficult to work. I think, then, that we ought to adopt a"
"x83","material excellent in its way and of low price, such as cast iron. What"
"x83","is your advice, major?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“I quite agree with you,” replied Elphinstone."
"x83",""
"x83","“In fact,” continued Barbicane, “cast iron costs ten times less than"
"x83","bronze; it is easy to cast, it runs readily from the moulds of sand, it"
"x83","is easy of manipulation, it is at once economical of money and of time."
"x83","In addition, it is excellent as a material, and I well remember that"
"x83","during the war, at the siege of Atlanta, some iron guns fired one"
"x83","thousand rounds at intervals of twenty minutes without injury.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Cast iron is very brittle, though,” replied Morgan."

"x83","“Yes, but it possesses great resistance. I will now ask our worthy"

"x83","CHAPTER IX."
"x83","THE QUESTION OF THE POWDERS"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","There remained for consideration merely the question of powders. The"
"x83","public awaited with interest its final decision. The size of the"
"x83","projectile, the length of the cannon being settled, what would be the"
"x83","quantity of powder necessary to produce impulsion?"
"x83",""
"x83","It is generally asserted that gunpowder was invented in the fourteenth"
"x83","century by the monk Schwartz, who paid for his grand discovery with his"
"x83","life. It is, however, pretty well proved that this story ought to be"
"x83","ranked among the legends of the middle ages. Gunpowder was not invented"
"x83","by any one; it was the lineal successor of the Greek fire, which, like"
"x83","itself, was composed of sulfur and saltpeter. Few persons are"
"x83","acquainted with the mechanical power of gunpowder. Now this is"
"x83","precisely what is necessary to be understood in order to comprehend the"
"x83","importance of the question submitted to the committee."
"x83",""
"x83","A litre of gunpowder weighs about two pounds; during combustion it"
"x83","produces 400 litres of gas. This gas, on being liberated and acted upon"
"x83","by temperature raised to 2,400 degrees, occupies a space of 4,000"
"x83","litres: consequently the volume of powder is to the volume of gas"
"x83","produced by its combustion as 1 to 4,000. One may judge, therefore, of"
"x83","the tremendous pressure on this gas when compressed within a space"
"x83","4,000 times too confined. All this was, of course, well known to the"
"x83","members of the committee when they met on the following evening."
"x83",""
"x83","The first speaker on this occasion was Major Elphinstone, who had been"
"x83","the director of the gunpowder factories during the war."
"x83",""
"x83","“Gentlemen,” said this distinguished chemist, “I begin with some"
"x83","figures which will serve as the basis of our calculation. The old"
"x83","24-pounder shot required for its discharge sixteen pounds of powder.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“You are certain of this amount?” broke in Barbicane."
"x83",""
"x83","“Quite certain,” replied the major. “The Armstrong cannon employs only"
"x83","seventy-five pounds of powder for a projectile of eight hundred pounds,"
"x83","and the Rodman Columbiad uses only one hundred and sixty pounds of"
"x83","powder to send its half ton shot a distance of six miles. These facts"
"x83","cannot be called in question, for I myself raised the point during the"
"x83","depositions taken before the committee of artillery.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Quite true,” said the general."
"x83",""
"x83","“Well,” replied the major, “these figures go to prove that the quantity"
"x83","of powder is not increased with the weight of the shot; that is to say,"
"x83","if a 24-pounder shot requires sixteen pounds of powder;—in other words,"
"x83","if in ordinary guns we employ a quantity of powder equal to two-thirds"
"x83","of the weight of the projectile, this proportion is not constant."
"x83","Calculate, and you will see that in place of three hundred and"
"x83","thirty-three pounds of powder, the quantity is reduced to no more than"
"x83","one hundred and sixty pounds.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“What are you aiming at?” asked the president."
"x83",""
"x83","“If you push your theory to extremes, my dear major,” said J. T."
"x83","Maston, “you will get to this, that as soon as your shot becomes"
"x83","sufficiently heavy you will not require any powder at all.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Our friend Maston is always at his jokes, even in serious matters,”"
"x83","cried the major; “but let him make his mind easy, I am going presently"
"x83","to propose gunpowder enough to satisfy his artillerist’s propensities."
"x83","I only keep to statistical facts when I say that, during the war, and"
"x83","for the very largest guns, the weight of the powder was reduced, as the"
"x83","result of experience, to a tenth part of the weight of the shot.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Perfectly correct,” said Morgan; “but before deciding the quantity of"
"x83","powder necessary to give the impulse, I think it would be as well—”"
"x83",""
"x83","“We shall have to employ a large-grained powder,” continued the major;"
"x83","“its combustion is more rapid than that of the small.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“No doubt about that,” replied Morgan; “but it is very destructive, and"
"x83","ends by enlarging the bore of the pieces.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Granted; but that which is injurious to a gun destined to perform long"
"x83","service is not so to our Columbiad. We shall run no danger of an"
"x83","explosion; and it is necessary that our powder should take fire"
"x83","instantaneously in order that its mechanical effect may be complete.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“We must have,” said Maston, “several touch-holes, so as to fire it at"
"x83","different points at the same time.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Certainly,” replied Elphinstone; “but that will render the working of"
"x83","the piece more difficult. I return then to my large-grained powder,"
"x83","which removes those difficulties. In his Columbiad charges Rodman"
"x83","employed a powder as large as chestnuts, made of willow charcoal,"
"x83","simply dried in cast- iron pans. This powder was hard and glittering,"
"x83","left no trace upon the hand, contained hydrogen and oxygen in large"
"x83","proportion, took fire instantaneously, and, though very destructive,"
"x83","did not sensibly injure the mouth-piece.”"
"x83",""
"x83","Up to this point Barbicane had kept aloof from the discussion; he left"
"x83","the others to speak while he himself listened; he had evidently got an"
"x83","idea. He now simply said, “Well, my friends, what quantity of powder do"
"x83","you propose?”"
"x83",""
"x83","The three members looked at one another."
"x83",""
"x83","“Two hundred thousand pounds.” at last said Morgan."
"x83",""
"x83","“Five hundred thousand,” added the major."
"x83",""
"x83","“Eight hundred thousand,” screamed Maston."
"x83",""
"x83","A moment of silence followed this triple proposal; it was at last"
"x83","broken by the president."
"x83",""
"x83","“Gentlemen,” he quietly said, “I start from this principle, that the"
"x83","resistance of a gun, constructed under the given conditions, is"
"x83","unlimited. I shall surprise our friend Maston, then, by stigmatizing"
"x83","his calculations as timid; and I propose to double his 800,000 pounds"
"x83","of powder.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Sixteen hundred thousand pounds?” shouted Maston, leaping from his"
"x83","seat."
"x83",""
"x83","“Just so.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“We shall have to come then to my ideal of a cannon half a mile long;"
"x83","for you see 1,600,000 pounds will occupy a space of about 20,000 cubic"
"x83","feet; and since the contents of your cannon do not exceed 54,000 cubic"
"x83","feet, it would be half full; and the bore will not be more than long"
"x83","enough for the gas to communicate to the projectile sufficient"
"x83","impulse.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Nevertheless,” said the president, “I hold to that quantity of powder."
"x83","Now, 1,600,000 pounds of powder will create 6,000,000,000 litres of"
"x83","gas. Six thousand millions! You quite understand?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“What is to be done then?” said the general."
"x83",""
"x83","“The thing is very simple; we must reduce this enormous quantity of"
"x83","powder, while preserving to it its mechanical power.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Good; but by what means?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“I am going to tell you,” replied Barbicane quietly."
"x83",""
"x83","“Nothing is more easy than to reduce this mass to one quarter of its"
"x83","bulk. You know that curious cellular matter which constitutes the"
"x83","elementary tissues of vegetable? This substance is found quite pure in"
"x83","many bodies, especially in cotton, which is nothing more than the down"
"x83","of the seeds of the cotton plant. Now cotton, combined with cold nitric"
"x83","acid, become transformed into a substance eminently insoluble,"
"x83","combustible, and explosive. It was first discovered in 1832, by"
"x83","Braconnot, a French chemist, who called it xyloidine. In 1838 another"
"x83","Frenchman, Pelouze, investigated its different properties, and finally,"
"x83","in 1846, Schonbein, professor of chemistry at Bale, proposed its"
"x83","employment for purposes of war. This powder, now called pyroxyle, or"
"x83","fulminating cotton, is prepared with great facility by simply plunging"
"x83","cotton for fifteen minutes in nitric acid, then washing it in water,"
"x83","then drying it, and it is ready for use.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Nothing could be more simple,” said Morgan."
"x83",""
"x83","“Moreover, pyroxyle is unaltered by moisture—a valuable property to us,"
"x83","inasmuch as it would take several days to charge the cannon. It ignites"
"x83","at 170 degrees in place of 240, and its combustion is so rapid that one"
"x83","may set light to it on the top of the ordinary powder, without the"
"x83","latter having time to ignite.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Perfect!” exclaimed the major."
"x83",""
"x83","“Only it is more expensive.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“What matter?” cried J. T. Maston."
"x83",""
"x83","“Finally, it imparts to projectiles a velocity four times superior to"
"x83","that of gunpowder. I will even add, that if we mix it with one-eighth"
"x83","of its own weight of nitrate of potassium, its expansive force is again"
"x83","considerably augmented.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Will that be necessary?” asked the major."
"x83",""
"x83","“I think not,” replied Barbicane. “So, then, in place of 1,600,000"
"x83","pounds of powder, we shall have but 400,000 pounds of fulminating"
"x83","cotton; and since we can, without danger, compress 500 pounds of cotton"
"x83","into twenty-seven cubic feet, the whole quantity will not occupy a"
"x83","height of more than 180 feet within the bore of the Columbiad. In this"
"x83","way the shot will have more than 700 feet of bore to traverse under a"
"x83","force of 6,000,000,000 litres of gas before taking its flight toward"
"x83","the moon.”"
"x83",""
"x83","At this juncture J. T. Maston could not repress his emotion; he flung"

"x83","ONE ENEMY _v._ TWENTY-FIVE MILLIONS OF FRIENDS"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","The American public took a lively interest in the smallest details of"
"x83","the enterprise of the Gun Club. It followed day by day the discussion"
"x83","of the committee. The most simple preparations for the great"
"x83","experiment, the questions of figures which it involved, the mechanical"
"x83","difficulties to be resolved—in one word, the entire plan of work—roused"
"x83","the popular excitement to the highest pitch."
"x83",""
"x83","The purely scientific attraction was suddenly intensified by the"
"x83","following incident:"
"x83",""
"x83","We have seen what legions of admirers and friends Barbicane’s project"
"x83","had rallied round its author. There was, however, one single individual"
"x83","alone in all the States of the Union who protested against the attempt"
"x83","of the Gun Club. He attacked it furiously on every opportunity, and"
"x83","human nature is such that Barbicane felt more keenly the opposition of"
"x83","that one man than he did the applause of all the others. He was well"
"x83","aware of the motive of this antipathy, the origin of this solitary"
"x83","enmity, the cause of its personality and old standing, and in what"
"x83","rivalry of self-love it had its rise."
"x83",""
"x83","This persevering enemy the president of the Gun Club had never seen."
"x83","Fortunate that it was so, for a meeting between the two men would"
"x83","certainly have been attended with serious consequences. This rival was"
"x83","a man of science, like Barbicane himself, of a fiery, daring, and"
"x83","violent disposition; a pure Yankee. His name was Captain Nicholl; he"
"x83","lived at Philadelphia."
"x83",""
"x83","Most people are aware of the curious struggle which arose during the"
"x83","Federal war between the guns and armor of iron-plated ships. The result"
"x83","was the entire reconstruction of the navy of both the continents; as"
"x83","the one grew heavier, the other became thicker in proportion. The"
"x83","Merrimac, the Monitor, the Tennessee, the Weehawken discharged enormous"
"x83","projectiles themselves, after having been armor-clad against the"
"x83","projectiles of others. In fact they did to others that which they would"

"x83","Now if Barbicane was a great founder of shot, Nicholl was a great"

"x83","current of ideas essentially opposed to the other. Happily for these"
"x83","citizens, so useful to their country, a distance of from fifty to sixty"
"x83","miles separated them from one another, and they had never yet met."
"x83","Which of these two inventors had the advantage over the other it was"
"x83","difficult to decide from the results obtained. By last accounts,"
"x83","however, it would seem that the armor-plate would in the end have to"
"x83","give way to the shot; nevertheless, there were competent judges who had"
"x83","their doubts on the point."
"x83",""
"x83","At the last experiment the cylindro-conical projectiles of Barbicane"
"x83","stuck like so many pins in the Nicholl plates. On that day the"
"x83","Philadelphia iron-forger then believed himself victorious, and could"
"x83","not evince contempt enough for his rival; but when the other afterward"
"x83","substituted for conical shot simple 600-pound shells, at very moderate"
"x83","velocity, the captain was obliged to give in. In fact, these"
"x83","projectiles knocked his best metal plate to shivers."
"x83",""
"x83","Matters were at this stage, and victory seemed to rest with the shot,"
"x83","when the war came to an end on the very day when Nicholl had completed"
"x83","a new armor-plate of wrought steel. It was a masterpiece of its kind,"
"x83","and bid defiance to all the projectiles of the world. The captain had"
"x83","it conveyed to the Polygon at Washington, challenging the president of"
"x83","the Gun Club to break it. Barbicane, peace having been declared,"
"x83","declined to try the experiment."
"x83",""
"x83","Nicholl, now furious, offered to expose his plate to the shock of any"
"x83","shot, solid, hollow, round, or conical. Refused by the president, who"
"x83","did not choose to compromise his last success."
"x83",""
"x83","Nicholl, disgusted by this obstinacy, tried to tempt Barbicane by"
"x83","offering him every chance. He proposed to fix the plate within two"
"x83","hundred yards of the gun. Barbicane still obstinate in refusal. A"
"x83","hundred yards? Not even seventy-five!"
"x83",""
"x83","“At fifty then!” roared the captain through the newspapers. “At"
"x83","twenty-five yards! and I’ll stand behind!”"
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane returned for answer that, even if Captain Nicholl would be so"
"x83","good as to stand in front, he would not fire any more."
"x83",""
"x83","Nicholl could not contain himself at this reply; threw out hints of"
"x83","cowardice; that a man who refused to fire a cannon-shot was pretty near"
"x83","being afraid of it; that artillerists who fight at six miles distance"
"x83","are substituting mathematical formulae for individual courage."
"x83",""
"x83","To these insinuations Barbicane returned no answer; perhaps he never"
"x83","heard of them, so absorbed was he in the calculations for his great"
"x83","enterprise."
"x83",""
"x83","When his famous communication was made to the Gun Club, the captain’s"
"x83","wrath passed all bounds; with his intense jealousy was mingled a"
"x83","feeling of absolute impotence. How was he to invent anything to beat"
"x83","this 900-feet Columbiad? What armor-plate could ever resist a"
"x83","projectile of 30,000 pounds weight? Overwhelmed at first under this"
"x83","violent shock, he by and by recovered himself, and resolved to crush"
"x83","the proposal by weight of his arguments."
"x83",""
"x83","He then violently attacked the labors of the Gun Club, published a"
"x83","number of letters in the newspapers, endeavored to prove Barbicane"
"x83","ignorant of the first principles of gunnery. He maintained that it was"
"x83","absolutely impossible to impress upon any body whatever a velocity of"
"x83","12,000 yards per second; that even with such a velocity a projectile of"
"x83","such a weight could not transcend the limits of the earth’s atmosphere."
"x83","Further still, even regarding the velocity to be acquired, and granting"
"x83","it to be sufficient, the shell could not resist the pressure of the gas"
"x83","developed by the ignition of 1,600,000 pounds of powder; and supposing"
"x83","it to resist that pressure, it would be less able to support that"
"x83","temperature; it would melt on quitting the Columbiad, and fall back in"
"x83","a red-hot shower upon the heads of the imprudent spectators."
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane continued his work without regarding these attacks."
"x83",""
"x83","Nicholl then took up the question in its other aspects. Without"
"x83","touching upon its uselessness in all points of view, he regarded the"
"x83","experiment as fraught with extreme danger, both to the citizens, who"
"x83","might sanction by their presence so reprehensible a spectacle, and also"
"x83","to the towns in the neighborhood of this deplorable cannon. He also"
"x83","observed that if the projectile did not succeed in reaching its"
"x83","destination (a result absolutely impossible), it must inevitably fall"
"x83","back upon the earth, and that the shock of such a mass, multiplied by"
"x83","the square of its velocity, would seriously endanger every point of the"
"x83","globe. Under the circumstances, therefore, and without interfering with"
"x83","the rights of free citizens, it was a case for the intervention of"
"x83","Government, which ought not to endanger the safety of all for the"
"x83","pleasure of one individual."
"x83",""
"x83","In spite of all his arguments, however, Captain Nicholl remained alone"
"x83","in his opinion. Nobody listened to him, and he did not succeed in"
"x83","alienating a single admirer from the president of the Gun Club. The"
"x83","latter did not even take the pains to refute the arguments of his"
"x83","rival."
"x83",""
"x83","Nicholl, driven into his last entrenchments, and not able to fight"
"x83","personally in the cause, resolved to fight with money. He published,"
"x83","therefore, in the Richmond _Inquirer_ a series of wagers, conceived in"
"x83","these terms, and on an increasing scale:"
"x83",""
"x83","No. 1 ($1,000).—That the necessary funds for the experiment of the Gun"
"x83","Club will not be forthcoming."
"x83",""
"x83","No. 2 ($2,000).—That the operation of casting a cannon of 900 feet is"
"x83","impracticable, and cannot possibly succeed."
"x83",""
"x83","No. 3 ($3,000).—That is it impossible to load the Columbiad, and that"
"x83","the pyroxyle will take fire spontaneously under the pressure of the"
"x83","projectile."
"x83",""
"x83","No. 4 ($4,000).—That the Columbiad will burst at the first fire."
"x83",""
"x83","No. 5 ($5,000).—That the shot will not travel farther than six miles,"
"x83","and that it will fall back again a few seconds after its discharge."
"x83",""
"x83","It was an important sum, therefore, which the captain risked in his"
"x83","invincible obstinacy. He had no less than $15,000 at stake."
"x83",""
"x83","Notwithstanding the importance of the challenge, on the 19th of May he"
"x83","received a sealed packet containing the following superbly laconic"
"x83","reply:"
"x83",""
"x83","“BALTIMORE, October 19."
"x83","”Done."

"x83","CHAPTER XI."
"x83","FLORIDA AND TEXAS"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","One question remained yet to be decided; it was necessary to choose a"
"x83","favorable spot for the experiment. According to the advice of the"
"x83","Observatory of Cambridge, the gun must be fired perpendicularly to the"
"x83","plane of the horizon, that is to say, toward the zenith. Now the moon"
"x83","does not traverse the zenith, except in places situated between 0° and"
"x83","28° of latitude. It became, then, necessary to determine exactly that"
"x83","spot on the globe where the immense Columbiad should be cast."
"x83",""
"x83","On the 20th of October, at a general meeting of the Gun Club, Barbicane"
"x83","produced a magnificent map of the United States. “Gentlemen,” said he,"
"x83","in opening the discussion, “I presume that we are all agreed that this"
"x83","experiment cannot and ought not to be tried anywhere but within the"
"x83","limits of the soil of the Union. Now, by good fortune, certain"
"x83","frontiers of the United States extend downward as far as the 28th"
"x83","parallel of the north latitude. If you will cast your eye over this"
"x83","map, you will see that we have at our disposal the whole of the"
"x83","southern portion of Texas and Florida.”"
"x83",""
"x83","It was finally agreed, then, that the Columbiad must be cast on the"
"x83","soil of either Texas or Florida. The result, however, of this decision"
"x83","was to create a rivalry entirely without precedent between the"
"x83","different towns of these two States."
"x83",""
"x83","The 28th parallel, on reaching the American coast, traverses the"
"x83","peninsula of Florida, dividing it into two nearly equal portions. Then,"
"x83","plunging into the Gulf of Mexico, it subtends the arc formed by the"
"x83","coast of Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana; then skirting Texas, off"
"x83","which it cuts an angle, it continues its course over Mexico, crosses"
"x83","the Sonora, Old California, and loses itself in the Pacific Ocean. It"
"x83","was, therefore, only those portions of Texas and Florida which were"
"x83","situated below this parallel which came within the prescribed"
"x83","conditions of latitude."
"x83",""
"x83","Florida, in its southern part, reckons no cities of importance; it is"
"x83","simply studded with forts raised against the roving Indians. One"
"x83","solitary town, Tampa Town, was able to put in a claim in favor of its"
"x83","situation."
"x83",""
"x83","In Texas, on the contrary, the towns are much more numerous and"
"x83","important. Corpus Christi, in the county of Nueces, and all the cities"
"x83","situated on the Rio Bravo, Laredo, Comalites, San Ignacio on the Web,"
"x83","Rio Grande City on the Starr, Edinburgh in the Hidalgo, Santa Rita,"
"x83","Elpanda, Brownsville in the Cameron, formed an imposing league against"
"x83","the pretensions of Florida. So, scarcely was the decision known, when"
"x83","the Texan and Floridan deputies arrived at Baltimore in an incredibly"
"x83","short space of time. From that very moment President Barbicane and the"
"x83","influential members of the Gun Club were besieged day and night by"
"x83","formidable claims. If seven cities of Greece contended for the honor of"
"x83","having given birth to a Homer, here were two entire States threatening"
"x83","to come to blows about the question of a cannon."
"x83",""
"x83","The rival parties promenaded the streets with arms in their hands; and"
"x83","at every occasion of their meeting a collision was to be apprehended"
"x83","which might have been attended with disastrous results. Happily the"
"x83","prudence and address of President Barbicane averted the danger. These"
"x83","personal demonstrations found a division in the newspapers of the"
"x83","different States. The New York _Herald_ and the _Tribune_ supported"
"x83","Texas, while the _Times_ and the _American Review_ espoused the cause"
"x83","of the Floridan deputies. The members of the Gun Club could not decide"
"x83","to which to give the preference."
"x83",""
"x83","Texas produced its array of twenty-six counties; Florida replied that"
"x83","twelve counties were better than twenty-six in a country only one-sixth"
"x83","part of the size."
"x83",""
"x83","Texas plumed itself upon its 330,000 natives; Florida, with a far"
"x83","smaller territory, boasted of being much more densely populated with"
"x83","56,000."
"x83",""
"x83","The Texans, through the columns of the _Herald_ claimed that some"
"x83","regard should be had to a State which grew the best cotton in all"
"x83","America, produced the best green oak for the service of the navy, and"
"x83","contained the finest oil, besides iron mines, in which the yield was"
"x83","fifty per cent. of pure metal."
"x83",""
"x83","To this the _American Review_ replied that the soil of Florida,"
"x83","although not equally rich, afforded the best conditions for the"
"x83","moulding and casting of the Columbiad, consisting as it did of sand and"
"x83","argillaceous earth."
"x83",""
"x83","“That may be all very well,” replied the Texans; “but you must first"
"x83","get to this country. Now the communications with Florida are difficult,"
"x83","while the coast of Texas offers the bay of Galveston, which possesses a"
"x83","circumference of fourteen leagues, and is capable of containing the"
"x83","navies of the entire world!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“A pretty notion truly,” replied the papers in the interest of Florida,"
"x83","“that of Galveston bay _below the 29th parallel!_ Have we not got the"
"x83","bay of Espiritu Santo, opening precisely upon _the 28th degree_, and by"
"x83","which ships can reach Tampa Town by direct route?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“A fine bay; half choked with sand!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Choked yourselves!” returned the others."
"x83",""
"x83","Thus the war went on for several days, when Florida endeavored to draw"
"x83","her adversary away on to fresh ground; and one morning the _Times_"
"x83","hinted that, the enterprise being essentially American, it ought not to"
"x83","be attempted upon other than purely American territory."
"x83",""
"x83","To these words Texas retorted, “American! are we not as much so as you?"
"x83","Were not Texas and Florida both incorporated into the Union in 1845?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Undoubtedly,” replied the _Times_; “but we have belonged to the"
"x83","Americans ever since 1820.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes!” returned the _Tribune_; “after having been Spaniards or English"
"x83","for two hundred years, you were sold to the United States for five"
"x83","million dollars!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Well! and why need we blush for that? Was not Louisiana bought from"
"x83","Napoleon in 1803 at the price of sixteen million dollars?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Scandalous!” roared the Texas deputies. “A wretched little strip of"
"x83","country like Florida to dare to compare itself to Texas, who, in place"
"x83","of selling herself, asserted her own independence, drove out the"
"x83","Mexicans in March 2, 1846, and declared herself a federal republic"
"x83","after the victory gained by Samuel Houston, on the banks of the San"
"x83","Jacinto, over the troops of Santa Anna!—a country, in fine, which"
"x83","voluntarily annexed itself to the United States of America!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes; because it was afraid of the Mexicans!” replied Florida."
"x83",""
"x83","“Afraid!” From this moment the state of things became intolerable. A"
"x83","sanguinary encounter seemed daily imminent between the two parties in"
"x83","the streets of Baltimore. It became necessary to keep an eye upon the"
"x83","deputies."
"x83",""
"x83","President Barbicane knew not which way to look. Notes, documents,"
"x83","letters full of menaces showered down upon his house. Which side ought"
"x83","he to take? As regarded the appropriation of the soil, the facility of"
"x83","communication, the rapidity of transport, the claims of both States"
"x83","were evenly balanced. As for political prepossessions, they had nothing"
"x83","to do with the question."
"x83",""
"x83","This dead block had existed for some little time, when Barbicane"
"x83","resolved to get rid of it all at once. He called a meeting of his"
"x83","colleagues, and laid before them a proposition which, it will be seen,"
"x83","was profoundly sagacious."
"x83",""
"x83","“On carefully considering,” he said, “what is going on now between"
"x83","Florida and Texas, it is clear that the same difficulties will recur"
"x83","with all the towns of the favored State. The rivalry will descend from"
"x83","State to city, and so on downward. Now Texas possesses eleven towns"
"x83","within the prescribed conditions, which will further dispute the honor"
"x83","and create us new enemies, while Florida has only one. I go in,"
"x83","therefore, for Florida and Tampa Town.”"
"x83",""
"x83","This decision, on being made known, utterly crushed the Texan deputies."
"x83","Seized with an indescribable fury, they addressed threatening letters"
"x83","to the different members of the Gun Club by name. The magistrates had"
"x83","but one course to take, and they took it. They chartered a special"
"x83","train, forced the Texans into it whether they would or no; and they"
"x83","quitted the city with a speed of thirty miles an hour."
"x83",""
"x83","Quickly, however, as they were despatched, they found time to hurl one"
"x83","last and bitter sarcasm at their adversaries."
"x83",""
"x83","Alluding to the extent of Florida, a mere peninsula confined between"
"x83","two seas, they pretended that it could never sustain the shock of the"
"x83","discharge, and that it would “bust up” at the very first shot."
"x83",""
"x83","“Very well, let it bust up!” replied the Floridans, with a brevity of"

"x83","URBI ET ORBI"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","The astronomical, mechanical, and topographical difficulties resolved,"
"x83","finally came the question of finance. The sum required was far too"
"x83","great for any individual, or even any single State, to provide the"
"x83","requisite millions."
"x83",""
"x83","President Barbicane undertook, despite of the matter being a purely"
"x83","American affair, to render it one of universal interest, and to request"
"x83","the financial co-operation of all peoples. It was, he maintained, the"
"x83","right and duty of the whole earth to interfere in the affairs of its"
"x83","satellite. The subscription opened at Baltimore extended properly to"
"x83","the whole world—_Urbi et orbi_."
"x83",""
"x83","This subscription was successful beyond all expectation;"
"x83","notwithstanding that it was a question not of lending but of giving the"
"x83","money. It was a purely disinterested operation in the strictest sense"
"x83","of the term, and offered not the slightest chance of profit."
"x83",""
"x83","The effect, however, of Barbicane’s communication was not confined to"
"x83","the frontiers of the United States; it crossed the Atlantic and"
"x83","Pacific, invading simultaneously Asia and Europe, Africa and Oceanica."
"x83","The observatories of the Union placed themselves in immediate"
"x83","communication with those of foreign countries. Some, such as those of"
"x83","Paris, Petersburg, Berlin, Stockholm, Hamburg, Malta, Lisbon, Benares,"
"x83","Madras, and others, transmitted their good wishes; the rest maintained"
"x83","a prudent silence, quietly awaiting the result. As for the observatory"
"x83","at Greenwich, seconded as it was by the twenty- two astronomical"
"x83","establishments of Great Britain, it spoke plainly enough. It boldly"
"x83","denied the possibility of success, and pronounced in favor of the"
"x83","theories of Captain Nicholl. But this was nothing more than mere"
"x83","English jealousy."
"x83",""
"x83","On the 8th of October President Barbicane published a manifesto full of"
"x83","enthusiasm, in which he made an appeal to “all persons of good will"

"x83","the French paid before singing, so now they paid after having had their"

"x83","Two hundred and fifty-seven francs, this was the modest contribution of"

"x83","As to Spain, she could not scrape together more than 110 reals. She"

"x83","Chili, Brazil, the provinces of La Plata and Columbia, had poured forth"
"x83","their quota into their hands, the sum of $300,000, it found itself in"

"x83","Such was the sum which the public poured into the treasury of the Gun"

"x83",""
"x83","Let no one be surprised at the vastness of the amount. The work of"
"x83","casting, boring, masonry, the transport of workmen, their establishment"
"x83","in an almost uninhabited country, the construction of furnaces and"
"x83","workshops, the plant, the powder, the projectile, and incipient"

"x83","On the 20th of October a contract was entered into with the manufactory"

"x83","contracting parties that the manufactory of Coldspring should engage to"
"x83","transport to Tampa Town, in southern Florida, the necessary materials"

"x83",""
"x83","When the decision was arrived at by the Gun Club, to the disparagement"
"x83","of Texas, every one in America, where reading is a universal"
"x83","acquirement, set to work to study the geography of Florida. Never"
"x83","before had there been such a sale for works like “Bertram’s Travels in"
"x83","Florida,” “Roman’s Natural History of East and West Florida,”"
"x83","“William’s Territory of Florida,” and “Cleland on the Cultivation of"
"x83","the Sugar-Cane in Florida.” It became necessary to issue fresh editions"
"x83","of these works."
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane had something better to do than to read. He desired to see"
"x83","things with his own eyes, and to mark the exact position of the"
"x83","proposed gun. So, without a moment’s loss of time, he placed at the"
"x83","disposal of the Cambridge Observatory the funds necessary for the"
"x83","construction of a telescope, and entered into negotiations with the"
"x83","house of Breadwill and Co., of Albany, for the construction of an"
"x83","aluminum projectile of the required size. He then quitted Baltimore,"
"x83","accompanied by J. T. Maston, Major Elphinstone, and the manager of the"
"x83","Coldspring factory."
"x83",""
"x83","On the following day, the four fellow-travelers arrived at New Orleans."
"x83","There they immediately embarked on board the _Tampico_, a despatch-boat"
"x83","belonging to the Federal navy, which the government had placed at their"
"x83","disposal; and, getting up steam, the banks of Louisiana speedily"
"x83","disappeared from sight."
"x83",""
"x83","The passage was not long. Two days after starting, the _Tampico_,"
"x83","having made four hundred and eighty miles, came in sight of the coast"
"x83","of Florida. On a nearer approach Barbicane found himself in view of a"
"x83","low, flat country of somewhat barren aspect. After coasting along a"
"x83","series of creeks abounding in lobsters and oysters, the _Tampico_"
"x83","entered the bay of Espiritu Santo, where she finally anchored in a"
"x83","small natural harbor, formed by the _embouchure_ of the River"
"x83","Hillisborough, at seven P.M., on the 22d of October."
"x83",""
"x83","Our four passengers disembarked at once. “Gentlemen,” said Barbicane,"
"x83","“we have no time to lose; tomorrow we must obtain horses, and proceed"
"x83","to reconnoiter the country.”"

"x83","Barbicane had scarcely set his foot on shore when three thousand of the"
"x83","inhabitants of Tampa Town came forth to meet him, an honor due to the"
"x83","president who had signalized their country by his choice."
"x83",""
"x83","Declining, however, every kind of ovation, Barbicane ensconced himself"
"x83","in a room of the Franklin Hotel."
"x83",""
"x83","On the morrow some of the small horses of the Spanish breed, full of"
"x83","vigor and of fire, stood snorting under his windows; but instead of"
"x83","four steeds, here were fifty, together with their riders. Barbicane"
"x83","descended with his three fellow- travelers; and much astonished were"
"x83","they all to find themselves in the midst of such a cavalcade. He"
"x83","remarked that every horseman carried a carbine slung across his"
"x83","shoulders and pistols in his holsters."
"x83",""
"x83","On expressing his surprise at these preparations, he was speedily"
"x83","enlightened by a young Floridan, who quietly said:"
"x83",""
"x83","“Sir, there are Seminoles there.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“What do you mean by Seminoles?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Savages who scour the prairies. We thought it best, therefore, to"

"x83","“Pooh!” cried J. T. Maston, mounting his steed."

"x83","“All right,” said the Floridan; “but it is true enough, nevertheless.”"

"x83","“Gentlemen,” answered Barbicane, “I thank you for your kind attention;"

"x83",""
"x83","It was five A.M. when Barbicane and his party, quitting Tampa Town,"
"x83","made their way along the coast in the direction of Alifia Creek. This"
"x83","little river falls into Hillisborough Bay twelve miles above Tampa"
"x83","Town. Barbicane and his escort coasted along its right bank to the"
"x83","eastward. Soon the waves of the bay disappeared behind a bend of rising"
"x83","ground, and the Floridan “champagne” alone offered itself to view."
"x83",""
"x83","Florida, discovered on Palm Sunday, in 1512, by Juan Ponce de Leon, was"
"x83","originally named _Pascha Florida_. It little deserved that designation,"
"x83","with its dry and parched coasts. But after some few miles of tract the"
"x83","nature of the soil gradually changes and the country shows itself"
"x83","worthy of the name. Cultivated plains soon appear, where are united all"
"x83","the productions of the northern and tropical floras, terminating in"
"x83","prairies abounding with pineapples and yams, tobacco, rice,"
"x83","cotton-plants, and sugar-canes, which extend beyond reach of sight,"
"x83","flinging their riches broadcast with careless prodigality."

"x83","Barbicane appeared highly pleased on observing the progressive"

"x83","“My worthy friend, we cannot do better than sink our Columbiad in these"

"x83",""
"x83","“To get nearer the moon, perhaps?” said the secretary of the Gun Club."
"x83",""
"x83","“Not exactly,” replied Barbicane, smiling; “do you not see that among"
"x83","these elevated plateaus we shall have a much easier work of it? No"
"x83","struggles with the water-springs, which will save us long expensive"
"x83","tubings; and we shall be working in daylight instead of down a deep and"
"x83","narrow well. Our business, then, is to open our trenches upon ground"
"x83","some hundreds of yards above the level of the sea.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“You are right, sir,” struck in Murchison, the engineer; “and, if I"
"x83","mistake not, we shall ere long find a suitable spot for our purpose.”"

"x83","“I wish we were at the first stroke of the pickaxe,” said the"

"x83","“And I wish we were at the _last_,” cried J. T. Maston."
"x83",""
"x83","About ten A.M. the little band had crossed a dozen miles. To fertile"
"x83","plains succeeded a region of forests. There perfumes of the most varied"
"x83","kinds mingled together in tropical profusion. These almost impenetrable"
"x83","forests were composed of pomegranates, orange-trees, citrons, figs,"
"x83","olives, apricots, bananas, huge vines, whose blossoms and fruits"
"x83","rivaled each other in color and perfume. Beneath the odorous shade of"
"x83","these magnificent trees fluttered and warbled a little world of"

"x83",""
"x83","J. T. Maston and the major could not repress their admiration on"
"x83","finding themselves in the presence of the glorious beauties of this"
"x83","wealth of nature. President Barbicane, however, less sensitive to these"
"x83","wonders, was in haste to press forward; the very luxuriance of the"
"x83","country was displeasing to him. They hastened onward, therefore, and"
"x83","were compelled to ford several rivers, not without danger, for they"
"x83","were infested with huge alligators from fifteen to eighteen feet long."
"x83","Maston courageously menaced them with his steel hook, but he only"
"x83","succeeded in frightening some pelicans and teal, while tall flamingos"
"x83","stared stupidly at the party."
"x83",""
"x83","At length these denizens of the swamps disappeared in their turn;"
"x83","smaller trees became thinly scattered among less dense thickets—a few"
"x83","isolated groups detached in the midst of endless plains over which"
"x83","ranged herds of startled deer."
"x83",""
"x83","“At last,” cried Barbicane, rising in his stirrups, “here we are at the"

"x83",""
"x83","“Yes! and of savages too,” replied the major."
"x83",""
"x83","In fact, some Seminoles had just came in sight upon the horizon; they"
"x83","rode violently backward and forward on their fleet horses, brandishing"
"x83","their spears or discharging their guns with a dull report. These"
"x83","hostile demonstrations, however, had no effect upon Barbicane and his"
"x83","companions."
"x83",""
"x83","They were then occupying the center of a rocky plain, which the sun"
"x83","scorched with its parching rays. This was formed by a considerable"
"x83","elevation of the soil, which seemed to offer to the members of the Gun"
"x83","Club all the conditions requisite for the construction of their"

"x83","“Halt!” said Barbicane, reining up. “Has this place any local"

"x83","Barbicane, without saying a word, dismounted, seized his instruments,"
"x83","and began to note his position with extreme exactness. The little band,"
"x83","drawn up in the rear, watched his proceedings in profound silence."
"x83",""
"x83","At this moment the sun passed the meridian. Barbicane, after a few"
"x83","moments, rapidly wrote down the result of his observations, and said:"

"x83","“This spot is situated eighteen hundred feet above the level of the"
"x83","sea, in 27° 7′ N. lat. and 5° 7′ W. long. of the meridian of"

"x83","all the conditions requisite for our experiment. On that plain will be"
"x83","raised our magazines, workshops, furnaces, and workmen’s huts; and"

"x83","PICKAXE AND TROWEL"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","The same evening Barbicane and his companions returned to Tampa Town;"
"x83","and Murchison, the engineer, re-embarked on board the Tampico for New"
"x83","Orleans. His object was to enlist an army of workmen, and to collect"
"x83","together the greater part of the materials. The members of the Gun Club"
"x83","remained at Tampa Town, for the purpose of setting on foot the"
"x83","preliminary works by the aid of the people of the country."
"x83",""
"x83","Eight days after its departure, the Tampico returned into the bay of"
"x83","Espiritu Santo, with a whole flotilla of steamboats. Murchison had"
"x83","succeeded in assembling together fifteen hundred artisans. Attracted by"
"x83","the high pay and considerable bounties offered by the Gun Club, he had"
"x83","enlisted a choice legion of stokers, iron-founders, lime-burners,"
"x83","miners, brickmakers, and artisans of every trade, without distinction"
"x83","of color. As many of these people brought their families with them,"
"x83","their departure resembled a perfect emigration."
"x83",""
"x83","On the 31st of October, at ten o’clock in the morning, the troop"
"x83","disembarked on the quays of Tampa Town; and one may imagine the"
"x83","activity which pervaded that little town, whose population was thus"
"x83","doubled in a single day."
"x83",""
"x83","During the first few days they were busy discharging the cargo brought"
"x83","by the flotilla, the machines, and the rations, as well as a large"
"x83","number of huts constructed of iron plates, separately pieced and"
"x83","numbered. At the same period Barbicane laid the first sleepers of a"
"x83","railway fifteen miles in length, intended to unite Stones Hill with"
"x83","Tampa Town. On the first of November Barbicane quitted Tampa Town with"
"x83","a detachment of workmen; and on the following day the whole town of"
"x83","huts was erected round Stones Hill. This they enclosed with palisades;"
"x83","and in respect of energy and activity, it might have been mistaken for"
"x83","one of the great cities of the Union. Everything was placed under a"
"x83","complete system of discipline, and the works were commenced in most"
"x83","perfect order."
"x83",""
"x83","The nature of the soil having been carefully examined, by means of"
"x83","repeated borings, the work of excavation was fixed for the 4th of"
"x83","November."
"x83",""
"x83","On that day Barbicane called together his foremen and addressed them as"
"x83","follows: “You are well aware, my friends, of the object with which I"
"x83","have assembled you together in this wild part of Florida. Our business"
"x83","is to construct a cannon measuring nine feet in its interior diameter,"
"x83","six feet thick, and with a stone revetment of nineteen and a half feet"
"x83","in thickness. We have, therefore, a well of sixty feet in diameter to"
"x83","dig down to a depth of nine hundred feet. This great work must be"
"x83","completed within eight months, so that you have 2,543,400 cubic feet of"
"x83","earth to excavate in 255 days; that is to say, in round numbers, 2,000"
"x83","cubic feet per day. That which would present no difficulty to a"
"x83","thousand navvies working in open country will be of course more"
"x83","troublesome in a comparatively confined space. However, the thing must"
"x83","be done, and I reckon for its accomplishment upon your courage as much"
"x83","as upon your skill.”"
"x83",""
"x83","At eight o’clock the next morning the first stroke of the pickaxe was"
"x83","struck upon the soil of Florida; and from that moment that prince of"
"x83","tools was never inactive for one moment in the hands of the excavators."
"x83","The gangs relieved each other every three hours."
"x83",""
"x83","On the 4th of November fifty workmen commenced digging, in the very"
"x83","center of the enclosed space on the summit of Stones Hill, a circular"
"x83","hole sixty feet in diameter. The pickaxe first struck upon a kind of"
"x83","black earth, six inches in thickness, which was speedily disposed of."
"x83","To this earth succeeded two feet of fine sand, which was carefully laid"
"x83","aside as being valuable for serving the casting of the inner mould."
"x83","After the sand appeared some compact white clay, resembling the chalk"
"x83","of Great Britain, which extended down to a depth of four feet. Then the"
"x83","iron of the picks struck upon the hard bed of the soil; a kind of rock"
"x83","formed of petrified shells, very dry, very solid, and which the picks"
"x83","could with difficulty penetrate. At this point the excavation exhibited"
"x83","a depth of six and a half feet and the work of the masonry was begun."
"x83",""
"x83","At the bottom of the excavation they constructed a wheel of oak, a kind"
"x83","of circle strongly bolted together, and of immense strength. The center"
"x83","of this wooden disc was hollowed out to a diameter equal to the"
"x83","exterior diameter of the Columbiad. Upon this wheel rested the first"
"x83","layers of the masonry, the stones of which were bound together by"
"x83","hydraulic cement, with irresistible tenacity. The workmen, after laying"
"x83","the stones from the circumference to the center, were thus enclosed"
"x83","within a kind of well twenty-one feet in diameter. When this work was"
"x83","accomplished, the miners resumed their picks and cut away the rock from"
"x83","underneath the wheel itself, taking care to support it as they advanced"
"x83","upon blocks of great thickness. At every two feet which the hole gained"
"x83","in depth they successively withdrew the blocks. The wheel then sank"
"x83","little by little, and with it the massive ring of masonry, on the upper"
"x83","bed of which the masons labored incessantly, always reserving some vent"
"x83","holes to permit the escape of gas during the operation of the casting."
"x83",""
"x83","This kind of work required on the part of the workmen extreme nicety"
"x83","and minute attention. More than one, in digging underneath the wheel,"
"x83","was dangerously injured by the splinters of stone. But their ardor"
"x83","never relaxed, night or day. By day they worked under the rays of the"
"x83","scorching sun; by night, under the gleam of the electric light. The"
"x83","sounds of the picks against the rock, the bursting of mines, the"
"x83","grinding of the machines, the wreaths of smoke scattered through the"
"x83","air, traced around Stones Hill a circle of terror which the herds of"
"x83","buffaloes and the war parties of the Seminoles never ventured to pass."
"x83","Nevertheless, the works advanced regularly, as the steam-cranes"
"x83","actively removed the rubbish. Of unexpected obstacles there was little"
"x83","account; and with regard to foreseen difficulties, they were speedily"
"x83","disposed of."
"x83",""
"x83","At the expiration of the first month the well had attained the depth"
"x83","assigned for that lapse of time, namely, 112 feet. This depth was"
"x83","doubled in December, and trebled in January."
"x83",""
"x83","During the month of February the workmen had to contend with a sheet of"
"x83","water which made its way right across the outer soil. It became"
"x83","necessary to employ very powerful pumps and compressed-air engines to"
"x83","drain it off, so as to close up the orifice from whence it issued; just"
"x83","as one stops a leak on board ship. They at last succeeded in getting"
"x83","the upper hand of these untoward streams; only, in consequence of the"
"x83","loosening of the soil, the wheel partly gave way, and a slight partial"
"x83","settlement ensued. This accident cost the life of several workmen."
"x83",""
"x83","No fresh occurrence thenceforward arrested the progress of the"
"x83","operation; and on the tenth of June, twenty days before the expiration"
"x83","of the period fixed by Barbicane, the well, lined throughout with its"
"x83","facing of stone, had attained the depth of 900 feet. At the bottom the"
"x83","masonry rested upon a massive block measuring thirty feet in thickness,"
"x83","while on the upper portion it was level with the surrounding soil."
"x83",""
"x83","President Barbicane and the members of the Gun Club warmly"
"x83","congratulated their engineer Murchison; the cyclopean work had been"
"x83","accomplished with extraordinary rapidity."
"x83",""
"x83","During these eight months Barbicane never quitted Stones Hill for a"
"x83","single instant. Keeping ever close by the work of excavation, he busied"
"x83","himself incessantly with the welfare and health of his workpeople, and"
"x83","was singularly fortunate in warding off the epidemics common to large"
"x83","communities of men, and so disastrous in those regions of the globe"
"x83","which are exposed to the influences of tropical climates."
"x83",""
"x83","Many workmen, it is true, paid with their lives for the rashness"
"x83","inherent in these dangerous labors; but these mishaps are impossible to"
"x83","be avoided, and they are classed among the details with which the"
"x83","Americans trouble themselves but little. They have in fact more regard"
"x83","for human nature in general than for the individual in particular."
"x83",""
"x83","Nevertheless, Barbicane professed opposite principles to these, and put"
"x83","them in force at every opportunity. So, thanks to his care, his"
"x83","intelligence, his useful intervention in all difficulties, his"
"x83","prodigious and humane sagacity, the average of accidents did not exceed"
"x83","that of transatlantic countries, noted for their excessive"

"x83","THE FETE OF THE CASTING"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","During the eight months which were employed in the work of excavation"
"x83","the preparatory works of the casting had been carried on simultaneously"
"x83","with extreme rapidity. A stranger arriving at Stones Hill would have"
"x83","been surprised at the spectacle offered to his view."
"x83",""
"x83","At 600 yards from the well, and circularly arranged around it as a"
"x83","central point, rose 1,200 reverberating ovens, each six feet in"
"x83","diameter, and separated from each other by an interval of three feet."
"x83","The circumference occupied by these 1,200 ovens presented a length of"
"x83","two miles. Being all constructed on the same plan, each with its high"
"x83","quadrangular chimney, they produced a most singular effect."
"x83",""
"x83","It will be remembered that on their third meeting the committee had"
"x83","decided to use cast iron for the Columbiad, and in particular the white"
"x83","description. This metal, in fact, is the most tenacious, the most"
"x83","ductile, and the most malleable, and consequently suitable for all"
"x83","moulding operations; and when smelted with pit coal, is of superior"
"x83","quality for all engineering works requiring great resisting power, such"
"x83","as cannon, steam boilers, hydraulic presses, and the like."
"x83",""
"x83","Cast iron, however, if subjected to only one single fusion, is rarely"
"x83","sufficiently homogeneous; and it requires a second fusion completely to"
"x83","refine it by dispossessing it of its last earthly deposits. So long"
"x83","before being forwarded to Tampa Town, the iron ore, molten in the great"
"x83","furnaces of Coldspring, and brought into contact with coal and silicium"
"x83","heated to a high temperature, was carburized and transformed into cast"
"x83","iron. After this first operation, the metal was sent on to Stones Hill."
"x83","They had, however, to deal with 136,000,000 pounds of iron, a quantity"
"x83","far too costly to send by railway. The cost of transport would have"
"x83","been double that of material. It appeared preferable to freight vessels"
"x83","at New York, and to load them with the iron in bars. This, however,"
"x83","required not less than sixty- eight vessels of 1,000 tons, a veritable"
"x83","fleet, which, quitting New York on the 3rd of May, on the 10th of the"
"x83","same month ascended the Bay of Espiritu Santo, and discharged their"
"x83","cargoes, without dues, in the port at Tampa Town. Thence the iron was"
"x83","transported by rail to Stones Hill, and about the middle of January"
"x83","this enormous mass of metal was delivered at its destination."
"x83",""
"x83","It will easily be understood that 1,200 furnaces were not too many to"
"x83","melt simultaneously these 60,000 tons of iron. Each of these furnaces"
"x83","contained nearly 140,000 pounds weight of metal. They were all built"
"x83","after the model of those which served for the casting of the Rodman"
"x83","gun; they were trapezoidal in shape, with a high elliptical arch. These"
"x83","furnaces, constructed of fireproof brick, were especially adapted for"
"x83","burning pit coal, with a flat bottom upon which the iron bars were"
"x83","laid. This bottom, inclined at an angle of 25 degrees, allowed the"
"x83","metal to flow into the receiving troughs; and the 1,200 converging"
"x83","trenches carried the molten metal down to the central well."

"x83","The day following that on which the works of the masonry and boring had"
"x83","been completed, Barbicane set to work upon the central mould. His"
"x83","object now was to raise within the center of the well, and with a"
"x83","coincident axis, a cylinder 900 feet high, and nine feet in diameter,"
"x83","which should exactly fill up the space reserved for the bore of the"
"x83","Columbiad. This cylinder was composed of a mixture of clay and sand,"
"x83","with the addition of a little hay and straw. The space left between the"
"x83","mould and the masonry was intended to be filled up by the molten metal,"
"x83","which would thus form the walls six feet in thickness. This cylinder,"
"x83","in order to maintain its equilibrium, had to be bound by iron bands,"
"x83","and firmly fixed at certain intervals by cross-clamps fastened into the"
"x83","stone lining; after the castings these would be buried in the block of"
"x83","metal, leaving no external projection."
"x83",""
"x83","This operation was completed on the 8th of July, and the run of the"
"x83","metal was fixed for the following day."
"x83",""
"x83","“This _fete_ of the casting will be a grand ceremony,” said J. T."
"x83","Maston to his friend Barbicane."
"x83",""
"x83","“Undoubtedly,” said Barbicane; “but it will not be a public _fete_“"
"x83",""
"x83","“What! will you not open the gates of the enclosure to all comers?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“I must be very careful, Maston. The casting of the Columbiad is an"
"x83","extremely delicate, not to say a dangerous operation, and I should"
"x83","prefer its being done privately. At the discharge of the projectile, a"
"x83","_fete_ if you like—till then, no!”"
"x83",""
"x83","The president was right. The operation involved unforeseen dangers,"
"x83","which a great influx of spectators would have hindered him from"
"x83","averting. It was necessary to preserve complete freedom of movement. No"
"x83","one was admitted within the enclosure except a delegation of members of"
"x83","the Gun Club, who had made the voyage to Tampa Town. Among these was"
"x83","the brisk Bilsby, Tom Hunter, Colonel Blomsberry, Major Elphinstone,"
"x83","General Morgan, and the rest of the lot to whom the casting of the"
"x83","Columbiad was a matter of personal interest. J. T. Maston became their"
"x83","cicerone. He omitted no point of detail; he conducted them throughout"
"x83","the magazines, workshops, through the midst of the engines, and"
"x83","compelled them to visit the whole 1,200 furnaces one after the other."
"x83","At the end of the twelve-hundredth visit they were pretty well knocked"
"x83","up."
"x83",""
"x83","The casting was to take place at twelve o’clock precisely. The previous"
"x83","evening each furnace had been charged with 114,000 pounds weight of"
"x83","metal in bars disposed cross-ways to each other, so as to allow the hot"
"x83","air to circulate freely between them. At daybreak the 1,200 chimneys"
"x83","vomited their torrents of flame into the air, and the ground was"
"x83","agitated with dull tremblings. As many pounds of metal as there were to"
"x83","cast, so many pounds of coal were there to burn. Thus there were 68,000"
"x83","tons of coal which projected in the face of the sun a thick curtain of"
"x83","smoke. The heat soon became insupportable within the circle of"
"x83","furnaces, the rumbling of which resembled the rolling of thunder. The"
"x83","powerful ventilators added their continuous blasts and saturated with"
"x83","oxygen the glowing plates. The operation, to be successful, required to"
"x83","be conducted with great rapidity. On a signal given by a cannon-shot"
"x83","each furnace was to give vent to the molten iron and completely to"
"x83","empty itself. These arrangements made, foremen and workmen waited the"
"x83","preconcerted moment with an impatience mingled with a certain amount of"
"x83","emotion. Not a soul remained within the enclosure. Each superintendent"
"x83","took his post by the aperture of the run."
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane and his colleagues, perched on a neighboring eminence,"
"x83","assisted at the operation. In front of them was a piece of artillery"
"x83","ready to give fire on the signal from the engineer. Some minutes before"
"x83","midday the first driblets of metal began to flow; the reservoirs filled"
"x83","little by little; and, by the time that the whole melting was"
"x83","completely accomplished, it was kept in abeyance for a few minutes in"
"x83","order to facilitate the separation of foreign substances."
"x83",""
"x83","Twelve o’clock struck! A gunshot suddenly pealed forth and shot its"
"x83","flame into the air. Twelve hundred melting-troughs were simultaneously"
"x83","opened and twelve hundred fiery serpents crept toward the central well,"
"x83","unrolling their incandescent curves. There, down they plunged with a"
"x83","terrific noise into a depth of 900 feet. It was an exciting and a"
"x83","magnificent spectacle. The ground trembled, while these molten waves,"
"x83","launching into the sky their wreaths of smoke, evaporated the moisture"
"x83","of the mould and hurled it upward through the vent-holes of the stone"
"x83","lining in the form of dense vapor-clouds. These artificial clouds"
"x83","unrolled their thick spirals to a height of 1,000 yards into the air. A"
"x83","savage, wandering somewhere beyond the limits of the horizon, might"
"x83","have believed that some new crater was forming in the bosom of Florida,"
"x83","although there was neither any eruption, nor typhoon, nor storm, nor"
"x83","struggle of the elements, nor any of those terrible phenomena which"
"x83","nature is capable of producing. No, it was man alone who had produced"
"x83","these reddish vapors, these gigantic flames worthy of a volcano itself,"
"x83","these tremendous vibrations resembling the shock of an earthquake,"
"x83","these reverberations rivaling those of hurricanes and storms; and it"
"x83","was his hand which precipitated into an abyss, dug by himself, a whole"
"x83","Niagara of molten metal!"

"x83","THE COLUMBIAD"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","Had the casting succeeded? They were reduced to mere conjecture. There"
"x83","was indeed every reason to expect success, since the mould has absorbed"
"x83","the entire mass of the molten metal; still some considerable time must"
"x83","elapse before they could arrive at any certainty upon the matter."
"x83",""
"x83","The patience of the members of the Gun Club was sorely tried during"
"x83","this period of time. But they could do nothing. J. T. Maston escaped"
"x83","roasting by a miracle. Fifteen days after the casting an immense column"
"x83","of smoke was still rising in the open sky and the ground burned the"
"x83","soles of the feet within a radius of two hundred feet round the summit"
"x83","of Stones Hill. It was impossible to approach nearer. All they could do"
"x83","was to wait with what patience they might."
"x83",""
"x83","“Here we are at the 10th of August,” exclaimed J. T. Maston one"
"x83","morning, “only four months to the 1st of December! We shall never be"
"x83","ready in time!” Barbicane said nothing, but his silence covered serious"
"x83","irritation."
"x83",""
"x83","However, daily observations revealed a certain change going on in the"
"x83","state of the ground. About the 15th of August the vapors ejected had"
"x83","sensibly diminished in intensity and thickness. Some days afterward the"
"x83","earth exhaled only a slight puff of smoke, the last breath of the"
"x83","monster enclosed within its circle of stone. Little by little the belt"
"x83","of heat contracted, until on the 22nd of August, Barbicane, his"
"x83","colleagues, and the engineer were enabled to set foot on the iron sheet"
"x83","which lay level upon the summit of Stones Hill."
"x83",""
"x83","“At last!” exclaimed the president of the Gun Club, with an immense"
"x83","sigh of relief."
"x83",""
"x83","The work was resumed the same day. They proceeded at once to extract"
"x83","the interior mould, for the purpose of clearing out the boring of the"
"x83","piece. Pickaxes and boring irons were set to work without intermission."
"x83","The clayey and sandy soils had acquired extreme hardness under the"
"x83","action of the heat; but, by the aid of the machines, the rubbish on"
"x83","being dug out was rapidly carted away on railway wagons; and such was"
"x83","the ardor of the work, so persuasive the arguments of Barbicane’s"
"x83","dollars, that by the 3rd of September all traces of the mould had"
"x83","entirely disappeared."
"x83",""
"x83","Immediately the operation of boring was commenced; and by the aid of"
"x83","powerful machines, a few weeks later, the inner surface of the immense"
"x83","tube had been rendered perfectly cylindrical, and the bore of the piece"
"x83","had acquired a thorough polish."
"x83",""
"x83","At length, on the 22d of September, less than a twelvemonth after"
"x83","Barbicane’s original proposition, the enormous weapon, accurately"
"x83","bored, and exactly vertically pointed, was ready for work. There was"
"x83","only the moon now to wait for; and they were pretty sure that she would"
"x83","not fail in the rendezvous."
"x83",""
"x83","The ecstasy of J. T. Maston knew no bounds, and he narrowly escaped a"
"x83","frightful fall while staring down the tube. But for the strong hand of"
"x83","Colonel Blomsberry, the worthy secretary, like a modern Erostratus,"
"x83","would have found his death in the depths of the Columbiad."
"x83",""
"x83","The cannon was then finished; there was no possible doubt as to its"
"x83","perfect completion. So, on the 6th of October, Captain Nicholl opened"
"x83","an account between himself and President Barbicane, in which he debited"
"x83","himself to the latter in the sum of two thousand dollars. One may"
"x83","believe that the captain’s wrath was increased to its highest point,"
"x83","and must have made him seriously ill. However, he had still three bets"
"x83","of three, four, and five thousand dollars, respectively; and if he"
"x83","gained two out of these, his position would not be very bad. But the"
"x83","money question did not enter into his calculations; it was the success"
"x83","of his rival in casting a cannon against which iron plates sixty feet"
"x83","thick would have been ineffectual, that dealt him a terrible blow."
"x83",""
"x83","After the 23rd of September the enclosure of Stones hill was thrown"
"x83","open to the public; and it will be easily imagined what was the"
"x83","concourse of visitors to this spot! There was an incessant flow of"
"x83","people to and from Tampa Town and the place, which resembled a"
"x83","procession, or rather, in fact, a pilgrimage."
"x83",""
"x83","It was already clear to be seen that, on the day of the experiment"
"x83","itself, the aggregate of spectators would be counted by millions; for"
"x83","they were already arriving from all parts of the earth upon this narrow"
"x83","strip of promontory. Europe was emigrating to America."
"x83",""
"x83","Up to that time, however, it must be confessed, the curiosity of the"
"x83","numerous comers was but scantily gratified. Most had counted upon"
"x83","witnessing the spectacle of the casting, and they were treated to"
"x83","nothing but smoke. This was sorry food for hungry eyes; but Barbicane"
"x83","would admit no one to that operation. Then ensued grumbling,"
"x83","discontent, murmurs; they blamed the president, taxed him with"
"x83","dictatorial conduct. His proceedings were declared “un-American.” There"
"x83","was very nearly a riot round Stones Hill; but Barbicane remained"
"x83","inflexible. When, however, the Columbiad was entirely finished, this"
"x83","state of closed doors could no longer be maintained; besides it would"
"x83","have been bad taste, and even imprudence, to affront the public"
"x83","feeling. Barbicane, therefore, opened the enclosure to all comers; but,"
"x83","true to his practical disposition, he determined to coin money out of"
"x83","the public curiosity."
"x83",""
"x83","It was something, indeed, to be enabled to contemplate this immense"
"x83","Columbiad; but to descend into its depths, this seemed to the Americans"
"x83","the _ne plus ultra_ of earthly felicity. Consequently, there was not"
"x83","one curious spectator who was not willing to give himself the treat of"
"x83","visiting the interior of this great metallic abyss. Baskets suspended"
"x83","from steam-cranes permitted them to satisfy their curiosity. There was"
"x83","a perfect mania. Women, children, old men, all made it a point of duty"
"x83","to penetrate the mysteries of the colossal gun. The fare for the"
"x83","descent was fixed at five dollars per head; and despite this high"
"x83","charge, during the two months which preceded the experiment, the influx"
"x83","of visitors enabled the Gun Club to pocket nearly five hundred thousand"
"x83","dollars!"
"x83",""
"x83","It is needless to say that the first visitors of the Columbiad were the"
"x83","members of the Gun Club. This privilege was justly reserved for that"
"x83","illustrious body. The ceremony took place on the 25th of September. A"
"x83","basket of honor took down the president, J. T. Maston, Major"
"x83","Elphinstone, General Morgan, Colonel Blomsberry, and other members of"
"x83","the club, to the number of ten in all. How hot it was at the bottom of"
"x83","that long tube of metal! They were half suffocated. But what delight!"
"x83","What ecstasy! A table had been laid with six covers on the massive"
"x83","stone which formed the bottom of the Columbiad, and lighted by a jet of"
"x83","electric light resembling that of day itself. Numerous exquisite"
"x83","dishes, which seemed to descend from heaven, were placed successively"
"x83","before the guests, and the richest wines of France flowed in profusion"
"x83","during this splendid repast, served nine hundred feet beneath the"
"x83","surface of the earth!"
"x83",""
"x83","The festival was animated, not to say somewhat noisy. Toasts flew"
"x83","backward and forward. They drank to the earth and to her satellite, to"
"x83","the Gun Club, the Union, the Moon, Diana, Phoebe, Selene, the “peaceful"
"x83","courier of the night!” All the hurrahs, carried upward upon the"
"x83","sonorous waves of the immense acoustic tube, arrived with the sound of"
"x83","thunder at its mouth; and the multitude ranged round Stones Hill"
"x83","heartily united their shouts with those of the ten revelers hidden from"
"x83","view at the bottom of the gigantic Columbiad."
"x83",""
"x83","J. T. Maston was no longer master of himself. Whether he shouted or"
"x83","gesticulated, ate or drank most, would be a difficult matter to"
"x83","determine. At all events, he would not have given his place up for an"
"x83","empire, “not even if the cannon—loaded, primed, and fired at that very"
"x83","moment—were to blow him in pieces into the planetary world.”"

"x83","A TELEGRAPHIC DISPATCH"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","The great works undertaken by the Gun Club had now virtually come to an"
"x83","end; and two months still remained before the day for the discharge of"
"x83","the shot to the moon. To the general impatience these two months"
"x83","appeared as long as years! Hitherto the smallest details of the"
"x83","operation had been daily chronicled by the journals, which the public"
"x83","devoured with eager eyes."
"x83",""
"x83","Just at this moment a circumstance, the most unexpected, the most"
"x83","extraordinary and incredible, occurred to rouse afresh their panting"
"x83","spirits, and to throw every mind into a state of the most violent"
"x83","excitement."
"x83",""
"x83","One day, the 30th of September, at 3:47 P.M., a telegram, transmitted"
"x83","by cable from Valentia (Ireland) to Newfoundland and the American"
"x83","Mainland, arrived at the address of President Barbicane."
"x83",""
"x83","The president tore open the envelope, read the dispatch, and, despite"
"x83","his remarkable powers of self-control, his lips turned pale and his"
"x83","eyes grew dim, on reading the twenty words of this telegram."
"x83",""
"x83","Here is the text of the dispatch, which figures now in the archives of"
"x83","the Gun Club:"
"x83",""
"x83","FRANCE, PARIS,"
"x83","30 September, 4 A.M."
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","            Barbicane, Tampa Town, Florida, United States."

"x83","THE PASSENGER OF THE ATLANTA"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","If this astounding news, instead of flying through the electric wires,"
"x83","had simply arrived by post in the ordinary sealed envelope, Barbicane"
"x83","would not have hesitated a moment. He would have held his tongue about"
"x83","it, both as a measure of prudence, and in order not to have to"
"x83","reconsider his plans. This telegram might be a cover for some jest,"
"x83","especially as it came from a Frenchman. What human being would ever"
"x83","have conceived the idea of such a journey? and, if such a person really"
"x83","existed, he must be an idiot, whom one would shut up in a lunatic ward,"
"x83","rather than within the walls of the projectile."
"x83",""
"x83","The contents of the dispatch, however, speedily became known; for the"
"x83","telegraphic officials possessed but little discretion, and Michel"
"x83","Ardan’s proposition ran at once throughout the several States of the"
"x83","Union. Barbicane, had, therefore, no further motives for keeping"
"x83","silence. Consequently, he called together such of his colleagues as"
"x83","were at the moment in Tampa Town, and without any expression of his own"
"x83","opinions simply read to them the laconic text itself. It was received"
"x83","with every possible variety of expressions of doubt, incredulity, and"
"x83","derision from every one, with the exception of J. T. Maston, who"
"x83","exclaimed, “It is a grand idea, however!”"
"x83",""
"x83","When Barbicane originally proposed to send a shot to the moon every one"
"x83","looked upon the enterprise as simple and practicable enough—a mere"
"x83","question of gunnery; but when a person, professing to be a reasonable"
"x83","being, offered to take passage within the projectile, the whole thing"
"x83","became a farce, or, in plainer language a humbug."
"x83",""
"x83","One question, however, remained. Did such a being exist? This telegram"
"x83","flashed across the depths of the Atlantic, the designation of the"
"x83","vessel on board which he was to take his passage, the date assigned for"
"x83","his speedy arrival, all combined to impart a certain character of"
"x83","reality to the proposal. They must get some clearer notion of the"
"x83","matter. Scattered groups of inquirers at length condensed themselves"
"x83","into a compact crowd, which made straight for the residence of"
"x83","President Barbicane. That worthy individual was keeping quiet with the"
"x83","intention of watching events as they arose. But he had forgotten to"
"x83","take into account the public impatience; and it was with no pleasant"
"x83","countenance that he watched the population of Tampa Town gathering"
"x83","under his windows. The murmurs and vociferations below presently"
"x83","obliged him to appear. He came forward, therefore, and on silence being"
"x83","procured, a citizen put point-blank to him the following question: “Is"
"x83","the person mentioned in the telegram, under the name of Michel Ardan,"
"x83","on his way here? Yes or no.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Gentlemen,” replied Barbicane, “I know no more than you do.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“We must know,” roared the impatient voices."
"x83",""
"x83","“Time will show,” calmly replied the president."
"x83",""
"x83","“Time has no business to keep a whole country in suspense,” replied the"
"x83","orator. “Have you altered the plans of the projectile according to the"
"x83","request of the telegram?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Not yet, gentlemen; but you are right! we must have better information"
"x83","to go by. The telegraph must complete its information.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“To the telegraph!” roared the crowd."
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane descended; and heading the immense assemblage, led the way to"
"x83","the telegraph office. A few minutes later a telegram was dispatched to"
"x83","the secretary of the underwriters at Liverpool, requesting answers to"
"x83","the following queries:"
"x83",""
"x83","“About the ship Atlanta—when did she leave Europe? Had she on board a"
"x83","Frenchman named Michel Ardan?”"
"x83",""
"x83","Two hours afterward Barbicane received information too exact to leave"
"x83","room for the smallest remaining doubt."
"x83",""
"x83","“The steamer Atlanta from Liverpool put to sea on the 2nd of October,"
"x83","bound for Tampa Town, having on board a Frenchman borne on the list of"
"x83","passengers by the name of Michel Ardan.”"
"x83",""
"x83","That very evening he wrote to the house of Breadwill and Co.,"
"x83","requesting them to suspend the casting of the projectile until the"
"x83","receipt of further orders. On the 10th of October, at nine A.M., the"
"x83","semaphores of the Bahama Canal signaled a thick smoke on the horizon."
"x83","Two hours later a large steamer exchanged signals with them. the name"
"x83","of the Atlanta flew at once over Tampa Town. At four o’clock the"
"x83","English vessel entered the Bay of Espiritu Santo. At five it crossed"
"x83","the passage of Hillisborough Bay at full steam. At six she cast anchor"
"x83","at Port Tampa. The anchor had scarcely caught the sandy bottom when"
"x83","five hundred boats surrounded the Atlanta, and the steamer was taken by"
"x83","assault. Barbicane was the first to set foot on deck, and in a voice of"
"x83","which he vainly tried to conceal the emotion, called “Michel Ardan.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Here!” replied an individual perched on the poop."
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane, with arms crossed, looked fixedly at the passenger of the"
"x83","Atlanta."
"x83",""
"x83","He was a man of about forty-two years of age, of large build, but"
"x83","slightly round-shouldered. His massive head momentarily shook a shock"
"x83","of reddish hair, which resembled a lion’s mane. His face was short with"
"x83","a broad forehead, and furnished with a moustache as bristly as a cat’s,"
"x83","and little patches of yellowish whiskers upon full cheeks. Round,"
"x83","wildish eyes, slightly near-sighted, completed a physiognomy"
"x83","essentially feline. His nose was firmly shaped, his mouth particularly"
"x83","sweet in expression, high forehead, intelligent and furrowed with"
"x83","wrinkles like a newly-plowed field. The body was powerfully developed"
"x83","and firmly fixed upon long legs. Muscular arms, and a general air of"
"x83","decision gave him the appearance of a hardy, jolly, companion. He was"
"x83","dressed in a suit of ample dimensions, loose neckerchief, open"
"x83","shirtcollar, disclosing a robust neck; his cuffs were invariably"
"x83","unbuttoned, through which appeared a pair of red hands."
"x83",""
"x83","On the bridge of the steamer, in the midst of the crowd, he bustled to"
"x83","and fro, never still for a moment, “dragging his anchors,” as the"
"x83","sailors say, gesticulating, making free with everybody, biting his"
"x83","nails with nervous avidity. He was one of those originals which nature"
"x83","sometimes invents in the freak of a moment, and of which she then"
"x83","breaks the mould."
"x83",""
"x83","Among other peculiarities, this curiosity gave himself out for a"
"x83","sublime ignoramus, “like Shakespeare,” and professed supreme contempt"
"x83","for all scientific men. Those “fellows,” as he called them, “are only"
"x83","fit to mark the points, while we play the game.” He was, in fact, a"
"x83","thorough Bohemian, adventurous, but not an adventurer; a hare-brained"
"x83","fellow, a kind of Icarus, only possessing relays of wings. For the"
"x83","rest, he was ever in scrapes, ending invariably by falling on his feet,"
"x83","like those little figures which they sell for children’s toys. In a few"
"x83","words, his motto was “I have my opinions,” and the love of the"
"x83","impossible constituted his ruling passion."
"x83",""
"x83","Such was the passenger of the Atlanta, always excitable, as if boiling"
"x83","under the action of some internal fire by the character of his physical"
"x83","organization. If ever two individuals offered a striking contrast to"
"x83","each other, these were certainly Michel Ardan and the Yankee Barbicane;"
"x83","both, moreover, being equally enterprising and daring, each in his own"
"x83","way."
"x83",""
"x83","The scrutiny which the president of the Gun Club had instituted"
"x83","regarding this new rival was quickly interrupted by the shouts and"
"x83","hurrahs of the crowd. The cries became at last so uproarious, and the"
"x83","popular enthusiasm assumed so personal a form, that Michel Ardan, after"
"x83","having shaken hands some thousands of times, at the imminent risk of"
"x83","leaving his fingers behind him, was fain at last to make a bolt for his"
"x83","cabin."
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane followed him without uttering a word."
"x83",""
"x83","“You are Barbicane, I suppose?” said Michel Ardan, in a tone of voice"
"x83","in which he would have addressed a friend of twenty years’ standing."

"x83","“Nothing. Have you modified your projectile according to my telegram.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“I waited for your arrival. But,” asked Barbicane again, “have you"
"x83","carefully reflected?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Reflected? have I any time to spare? I find an opportunity of making a"
"x83","tour in the moon, and I mean to profit by it. There is the whole gist"
"x83","of the matter.”"
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane looked hard at this man who spoke so lightly of his project"
"x83","with such complete absence of anxiety. “But, at least,” said he, “you"
"x83","have some plans, some means of carrying your project into execution?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Excellent, my dear Barbicane; only permit me to offer one remark: My"
"x83","wish is to tell my story once for all, to everybody, and then have done"
"x83","with it; then there will be no need for recapitulation. So, if you have"
"x83","no objection, assemble your friends, colleagues, the whole town, all"
"x83","Florida, all America if you like, and to-morrow I shall be ready to"
"x83","explain my plans and answer any objections whatever that may be"
"x83","advanced. You may rest assured I shall wait without stirring. Will that"
"x83","suit you?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“All right,” replied Barbicane."
"x83",""
"x83","So saying, the president left the cabin and informed the crowd of the"
"x83","proposal of Michel Ardan. His words were received with clappings of"
"x83","hands and shouts of joy. They had removed all difficulties. To-morrow"
"x83","every one would contemplate at his ease this European hero. However,"
"x83","some of the spectators, more infatuated than the rest, would not leave"
"x83","the deck of the Atlanta. They passed the night on board. Among others"
"x83","J. T. Maston got his hook fixed in the combing of the poop, and it"
"x83","pretty nearly required the capstan to get it out again."
"x83",""
"x83","“He is a hero! a hero!” he cried, a theme of which he was never tired"
"x83","of ringing the changes; “and we are only like weak, silly women,"
"x83","compared with this European!”"
"x83",""
"x83","As to the president, after having suggested to the visitors it was time"
"x83","to retire, he re-entered the passenger’s cabin, and remained there till"

"x83","A MONSTER MEETING"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","On the following day Barbicane, fearing that indiscreet questions might"
"x83","be put to Michel Ardan, was desirous of reducing the number of the"
"x83","audience to a few of the initiated, his own colleagues for instance. He"
"x83","might as well have tried to check the Falls of Niagara! he was"
"x83","compelled, therefore, to give up the idea, and let his new friend run"
"x83","the chances of a public conference. The place chosen for this monster"
"x83","meeting was a vast plain situated in the rear of the town. In a few"
"x83","hours, thanks to the help of the shipping in port, an immense roofing"
"x83","of canvas was stretched over the parched prairie, and protected it from"
"x83","the burning rays of the sun. There three hundred thousand people braved"
"x83","for many hours the stifling heat while awaiting the arrival of the"
"x83","Frenchman. Of this crowd of spectators a first set could both see and"
"x83","hear; a second set saw badly and heard nothing at all; and as for the"
"x83","third, it could neither see nor hear anything at all. At three o’clock"
"x83","Michel Ardan made his appearance, accompanied by the principal members"
"x83","of the Gun Club. He was supported on his right by President Barbicane,"
"x83","and on his left by J. T. Maston, more radiant than the midday sun, and"
"x83","nearly as ruddy. Ardan mounted a platform, from the top of which his"
"x83","view extended over a sea of black hats."
"x83",""
"x83","He exhibited not the slightest embarrassment; he was just as gay,"
"x83","familiar, and pleasant as if he were at home. To the hurrahs which"
"x83","greeted him he replied by a graceful bow; then, waving his hands to"
"x83","request silence, he spoke in perfectly correct English as follows:"
"x83",""
"x83","“Gentlemen, despite the very hot weather I request your patience for a"
"x83","short time while I offer some explanations regarding the projects which"
"x83","seem to have so interested you. I am neither an orator nor a man of"
"x83","science, and I had no idea of addressing you in public; but my friend"
"x83","Barbicane has told me that you would like to hear me, and I am quite at"
"x83","your service. Listen to me, therefore, with your six hundred thousand"
"x83","ears, and please excuse the faults of the speaker. Now pray do not"
"x83","forget that you see before you a perfect ignoramus whose ignorance goes"
"x83","so far that he cannot even understand the difficulties! It seemed to"
"x83","him that it was a matter quite simple, natural, and easy to take one’s"
"x83","place in a projectile and start for the moon! That journey must be"
"x83","undertaken sooner or later; and, as for the mode of locomotion adopted,"
"x83","it follows simply the law of progress. Man began by walking on"
"x83","all-fours; then, one fine day, on two feet; then in a carriage; then in"
"x83","a stage-coach; and lastly by railway. Well, the projectile is the"
"x83","vehicle of the future, and the planets themselves are nothing else! Now"
"x83","some of you, gentlemen, may imagine that the velocity we propose to"
"x83","impart to it is extravagant. It is nothing of the kind. All the stars"
"x83","exceed it in rapidity, and the earth herself is at this moment carrying"
"x83","us round the sun at three times as rapid a rate, and yet she is a mere"
"x83","lounger on the way compared with many others of the planets! And her"
"x83","velocity is constantly decreasing. Is it not evident, then, I ask you,"
"x83","that there will some day appear velocities far greater than these, of"
"x83","which light or electricity will probably be the mechanical agent?"
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes, gentlemen,” continued the orator, “in spite of the opinions of"
"x83","certain narrow-minded people, who would shut up the human race upon"
"x83","this globe, as within some magic circle which it must never outstep, we"
"x83","shall one day travel to the moon, the planets, and the stars, with the"
"x83","same facility, rapidity, and certainty as we now make the voyage from"
"x83","Liverpool to New York! Distance is but a relative expression, and must"
"x83","end by being reduced to zero.”"
"x83",""
"x83","The assembly, strongly predisposed as they were in favor of the French"
"x83","hero, were slightly staggered at this bold theory. Michel Ardan"
"x83","perceived the fact."
"x83",""
"x83","“Gentlemen,” he continued with a pleasant smile, “you do not seem quite"
"x83","convinced. Very good! Let us reason the matter out. Do you know how"
"x83","long it would take for an express train to reach the moon? Three"
"x83","hundred days; no more! And what is that? The distance is no more than"
"x83","nine times the circumference of the earth; and there are no sailors or"
"x83","travelers, of even moderate activity, who have not made longer journeys"
"x83","than that in their lifetime. And now consider that I shall be only"
"x83","ninety- seven hours on my journey. Ah! I see you are reckoning that the"
"x83","moon is a long way off from the earth, and that one must think twice"
"x83","before making the experiment. What would you say, then, if we were"
"x83","talking of going to Neptune, which revolves at a distance of more than"
"x83","two thousand seven hundred and twenty millions of miles from the sun!"
"x83","And yet what is that compared with the distance of the fixed stars,"
"x83","some of which, such as Arcturus, are billions of miles distant from us?"
"x83","And then you talk of the distance which separates the planets from the"
"x83","sun! And there are people who affirm that such a thing as distance"
"x83","exists. Absurdity, folly, idiotic nonsense! Would you know what I think"
"x83","of our own solar universe? Shall I tell you my theory? It is very"
"x83","simple! In my opinion the solar system is a solid homogeneous body; the"
"x83","planets which compose it are in actual contact with each other; and"
"x83","whatever space exists between them is nothing more than the space which"
"x83","separates the molecules of the densest metal, such as silver, iron, or"
"x83","platinum! I have the right, therefore, to affirm, and I repeat, with"
"x83","the conviction which must penetrate all your minds, ‘Distance is but an"
"x83","empty name; distance does not really exist!’”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Hurrah!” cried one voice (need it be said it was that of J. T."
"x83","Maston). “Distance does not exist!” And overcome by the energy of his"
"x83","movements, he nearly fell from the platform to the ground. He just"
"x83","escaped a severe fall, which would have proved to him that distance was"
"x83","by no means an empty name."
"x83",""
"x83","“Gentlemen,” resumed the orator, “I repeat that the distance between"
"x83","the earth and her satellite is a mere trifle, and undeserving of"
"x83","serious consideration. I am convinced that before twenty years are over"
"x83","one-half of our earth will have paid a visit to the moon. Now, my"
"x83","worthy friends, if you have any question to put to me, you will, I"
"x83","fear, sadly embarrass a poor man like myself; still I will do my best"
"x83","to answer you.”"
"x83",""
"x83","Up to this point the president of the Gun Club had been satisfied with"
"x83","the turn which the discussion had assumed. It became now, however,"
"x83","desirable to divert Ardan from questions of a practical nature, with"
"x83","which he was doubtless far less conversant. Barbicane, therefore,"
"x83","hastened to get in a word, and began by asking his new friend whether"
"x83","he thought that the moon and the planets were inhabited."
"x83",""
"x83","“You put before me a great problem, my worthy president,” replied the"
"x83","orator, smiling. “Still, men of great intelligence, such as Plutarch,"
"x83","Swedenborg, Bernardin de St. Pierre, and others have, if I mistake not,"
"x83","pronounced in the affirmative. Looking at the question from the natural"
"x83","philosopher’s point of view, I should say that nothing useless existed"
"x83","in the world; and, replying to your question by another, I should"
"x83","venture to assert, that if these worlds are habitable, they either are,"
"x83","have been, or will be inhabited.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“No one could answer more logically or fairly,” replied the president."
"x83","“The question then reverts to this: Are these worlds habitable? For my"
"x83","own part I believe they are.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“For myself, I feel certain of it,” said Michel Ardan."
"x83",""
"x83","“Nevertheless,” retorted one of the audience, “there are many arguments"
"x83","against the habitability of the worlds. The conditions of life must"
"x83","evidently be greatly modified upon the majority of them. To mention"
"x83","only the planets, we should be either broiled alive in some, or frozen"
"x83","to death in others, according as they are more or less removed from the"
"x83","sun.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“I regret,” replied Michel Ardan, “that I have not the honor of"
"x83","personally knowing my contradictor, for I would have attempted to"
"x83","answer him. His objection has its merits, I admit; but I think we may"
"x83","successfully combat it, as well as all others which affect the"
"x83","habitability of other worlds. If I were a natural philosopher, I would"
"x83","tell him that if less of caloric were set in motion upon the planets"
"x83","which are nearest to the sun, and more, on the contrary, upon those"
"x83","which are farthest removed from it, this simple fact would alone"
"x83","suffice to equalize the heat, and to render the temperature of those"
"x83","worlds supportable by beings organized like ourselves. If I were a"
"x83","naturalist, I would tell him that, according to some illustrious men of"
"x83","science, nature has furnished us with instances upon the earth of"
"x83","animals existing under very varying conditions of life; that fish"
"x83","respire in a medium fatal to other animals; that amphibious creatures"
"x83","possess a double existence very difficult of explanation; that certain"
"x83","denizens of the seas maintain life at enormous depths, and there"
"x83","support a pressure equal to that of fifty or sixty atmospheres without"
"x83","being crushed; that several aquatic insects, insensible to temperature,"
"x83","are met with equally among boiling springs and in the frozen plains of"
"x83","the Polar Sea; in fine, that we cannot help recognizing in nature a"
"x83","diversity of means of operation oftentimes incomprehensible, but not"
"x83","the less real. If I were a chemist, I would tell him that the"
"x83","aerolites, bodies evidently formed exteriorly of our terrestrial globe,"
"x83","have, upon analysis, revealed indisputable traces of carbon, a"
"x83","substance which owes its origin solely to organized beings, and which,"
"x83","according to the experiments of Reichenbach, must necessarily itself"
"x83","have been endued with animation. And lastly, were I a theologian, I"
"x83","would tell him that the scheme of the Divine Redemption, according to"
"x83","St. Paul, seems to be applicable, not merely to the earth, but to all"
"x83","the celestial worlds. But, unfortunately, I am neither theologian, nor"
"x83","chemist, nor naturalist, nor philosopher; therefore, in my absolute"
"x83","ignorance of the great laws which govern the universe, I confine myself"
"x83","to saying in reply, ‘I do not know whether the worlds are inhabited or"
"x83","not: and since I do not know, I am going to see!’”"
"x83",""
"x83","Whether Michel Ardan’s antagonist hazarded any further arguments or not"
"x83","it is impossible to say, for the uproarious shouts of the crowd would"
"x83","not allow any expression of opinion to gain a hearing. On silence being"
"x83","restored, the triumphant orator contented himself with adding the"
"x83","following remarks:"
"x83",""
"x83","“Gentlemen, you will observe that I have but slightly touched upon this"
"x83","great question. There is another altogether different line of argument"
"x83","in favor of the habitability of the stars, which I omit for the"
"x83","present. I only desire to call attention to one point. To those who"
"x83","maintain that the planets are _not_ inhabited one may reply: You might"
"x83","be perfectly in the right, if you could only show that the earth is the"
"x83","best possible world, in spite of what Voltaire has said. She has but"
"x83","_one_ satellite, while Jupiter, Uranus, Saturn, Neptune have each"
"x83","several, an advantage by no means to be despised. But that which"
"x83","renders our own globe so uncomfortable is the inclination of its axis"
"x83","to the plane of its orbit. Hence the inequality of days and nights;"
"x83","hence the disagreeable diversity of the seasons. On the surface of our"
"x83","unhappy spheroid we are always either too hot or too cold; we are"
"x83","frozen in winter, broiled in summer; it is the planet of rheumatism,"
"x83","coughs, bronchitis; while on the surface of Jupiter, for example, where"
"x83","the axis is but slightly inclined, the inhabitants may enjoy uniform"
"x83","temperatures. It possesses zones of perpetual springs, summers,"
"x83","autumns, and winters; every Jovian may choose for himself what climate"
"x83","he likes, and there spend the whole of his life in security from all"
"x83","variations of temperature. You will, I am sure, readily admit this"
"x83","superiority of Jupiter over our own planet, to say nothing of his"
"x83","years, which each equal twelve of ours! Under such auspices and such"
"x83","marvelous conditions of existence, it appears to me that the"
"x83","inhabitants of so fortunate a world must be in every respect superior"
"x83","to ourselves. All we require, in order to attain such perfection, is"
"x83","the mere trifle of having an axis of rotation less inclined to the"
"x83","plane of its orbit!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Hurrah!” roared an energetic voice, “let us unite our efforts, invent"
"x83","the necessary machines, and rectify the earth’s axis!”"
"x83",""
"x83","A thunder of applause followed this proposal, the author of which was,"
"x83","of course, no other than J. T. Maston. And, in all probability, if the"
"x83","truth must be told, if the Yankees could only have found a point of"
"x83","application for it, they would have constructed a lever capable of"
"x83","raising the earth and rectifying its axis. It was just this deficiency"
"x83","which baffled these daring mechanicians."

"x83",""
"x83","“Now that the speaker has favored us with so much imagination, would he"
"x83","be so good as to return to his subject, and give us a little practical"

"x83",""
"x83","All eyes were directed toward the person who spoke. He was a little"
"x83","dried-up man, of an active figure, with an American “goatee” beard."
"x83","Profiting by the different movements in the crowd, he had managed by"
"x83","degrees to gain the front row of spectators. There, with arms crossed"
"x83","and stern gaze, he watched the hero of the meeting. After having put"
"x83","his question he remained silent, and appeared to take no notice of the"
"x83","thousands of looks directed toward himself, nor of the murmur of"
"x83","disapprobation excited by his words. Meeting at first with no reply, he"
"x83","repeated his question with marked emphasis, adding, “We are here to"
"x83","talk about the _moon_ and not about the _earth_.”"
"x83",""

"x83","At this remark Ardan pushed up his shock of red hair; he saw that he"

"x83","Barbicane and his colleagues devoured with their eyes the intruder who"
"x83","had so boldly placed himself in antagonism to their enterprise. Nobody"
"x83","knew him, and the president, uneasy as to the result of so free a"
"x83","discussion, watched his new friend with some anxiety. The meeting began"
"x83","to be somewhat fidgety also, for the contest directed their attention"
"x83","to the dangers, if not the actual impossibilities, of the proposed"
"x83","expedition."
"x83",""
"x83","“Sir,” replied Ardan’s antagonist, “there are many and incontrovertible"
"x83","reasons which prove the absence of an atmosphere in the moon. I might"
"x83","say that, _a priori_, if one ever did exist, it must have been absorbed"
"x83","by the earth; but I prefer to bring forward indisputable facts.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Bring them forward then, sir, as many as you please.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“You know,” said the stranger, “that when any luminous rays cross a"
"x83","medium such as the air, they are deflected out of the straight line; in"
"x83","other words, they undergo refraction. Well! When stars are occulted by"
"x83","the moon, their rays, on grazing the edge of her disc, exhibit not the"
"x83","least deviation, nor offer the slightest indication of refraction. It"
"x83","follows, therefore, that the moon cannot be surrounded by an"
"x83","atmosphere."
"x83",""
"x83","“In point of fact,” replied Ardan, “this is your chief, if not your"
"x83","_only_ argument; and a really scientific man might be puzzled to answer"
"x83","it. For myself, I will simply say that it is defective, because it"
"x83","assumes that the angular diameter of the moon has been completely"
"x83","determined, which is not the case. But let us proceed. Tell me, my dear"
"x83","sir, do you admit the existence of volcanoes on the moon’s surface?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Extinct, yes! In activity, no!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“These volcanoes, however, were at one time in a state of activity?”"

"x83","“True, but, as they furnish themselves the oxygen necessary for"

"x83","of an atmosphere.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Proceed again, then; and let us set aside this class of arguments in"
"x83","order to come to direct observations. In 1715 the astronomers Louville"
"x83","and Halley, watching the eclipse of the 3rd of May, remarked some very"
"x83","extraordinary scintillations. These jets of light, rapid in nature, and"
"x83","of frequent recurrence, they attributed to thunderstorms generated in"
"x83","the lunar atmosphere.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“In 1715,” replied the unknown, “the astronomers Louville and Halley"
"x83","mistook for lunar phenomena some which were purely terrestrial, such as"
"x83","meteoric or other bodies which are generated in our own atmosphere."
"x83","This was the scientific explanation at the time of the facts; and that"
"x83","is my answer now.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“On again, then,” replied Ardan; “Herschel, in 1787, observed a great"
"x83","number of luminous points on the moon’s surface, did he not?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes! but without offering any solution of them. Herschel himself never"
"x83","inferred from them the necessity of a lunar atmosphere. And I may add"
"x83","that Baeer and Maedler, the two great authorities upon the moon, are"
"x83","quite agreed as to the entire absence of air on its surface.”"
"x83",""
"x83","A movement was here manifest among the assemblage, who appeared to be"
"x83","growing excited by the arguments of this singular personage."
"x83",""
"x83","“Let us proceed,” replied Ardan, with perfect coolness, “and come to"
"x83","one important fact. A skillful French astronomer, M. Laussedat, in"
"x83","watching the eclipse of July 18, 1860, probed that the horns of the"
"x83","lunar crescent were rounded and truncated. Now, this appearance could"
"x83","only have been produced by a deviation of the solar rays in traversing"

"x83","HOW A FRENCHMAN MANAGES AN AFFAIR"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","While the contract of this duel was being discussed by the president"
"x83","and the captain—this dreadful, savage duel, in which each adversary"
"x83","became a man-hunter—Michel Ardan was resting from the fatigues of his"
"x83","triumph. Resting is hardly an appropriate expression, for American beds"
"x83","rival marble or granite tables for hardness."
"x83",""
"x83","Ardan was sleeping, then, badly enough, tossing about between the"
"x83","cloths which served him for sheets, and he was dreaming of making a"
"x83","more comfortable couch in his projectile when a frightful noise"
"x83","disturbed his dreams. Thundering blows shook his door. They seemed to"
"x83","be caused by some iron instrument. A great deal of loud talking was"
"x83","distinguishable in this racket, which was rather too early in the"
"x83","morning. “Open the door,” some one shrieked, “for heaven’s sake!” Ardan"
"x83","saw no reason for complying with a demand so roughly expressed."
"x83","However, he got up and opened the door just as it was giving way before"
"x83","the blows of this determined visitor. The secretary of the Gun Club"
"x83","burst into the room. A bomb could not have made more noise or have"
"x83","entered the room with less ceremony."
"x83",""
"x83","“Last night,” cried J. T. Maston, _ex abrupto_, “our president was"
"x83","publicly insulted during the meeting. He provoked his adversary, who is"
"x83","none other than Captain Nicholl! They are fighting this morning in the"
"x83","wood of Skersnaw. I heard all the particulars from the mouth of"
"x83","Barbicane himself. If he is killed, then our scheme is at an end. We"
"x83","must prevent his duel; and one man alone has enough influence over"
"x83","Barbicane to stop him, and that man is Michel Ardan.”"
"x83",""
"x83","While J. T. Maston was speaking, Michel Ardan, without interrupting"
"x83","him, had hastily put on his clothes; and, in less than two minutes, the"
"x83","two friends were making for the suburbs of Tampa Town with rapid"
"x83","strides."
"x83",""
"x83","It was during this walk that Maston told Ardan the state of the case."
"x83","He told him the real causes of the hostility between Barbicane and"
"x83","Nicholl; how it was of old date, and why, thanks to unknown friends,"
"x83","the president and the captain had, as yet, never met face to face. He"
"x83","added that it arose simply from a rivalry between iron plates and shot,"
"x83","and, finally, that the scene at the meeting was only the"
"x83","long-wished-for opportunity for Nicholl to pay off an old grudge."
"x83",""
"x83","Nothing is more dreadful than private duels in America. The two"
"x83","adversaries attack each other like wild beasts. Then it is that they"
"x83","might well covet those wonderful properties of the Indians of the"
"x83","prairies—their quick intelligence, their ingenious cunning, their scent"
"x83","of the enemy. A single mistake, a moment’s hesitation, a single false"
"x83","step may cause death. On these occasions Yankees are often accompanied"
"x83","by their dogs, and keep up the struggle for hours."
"x83",""
"x83","“What demons you are!” cried Michel Ardan, when his companion had"
"x83","depicted this scene to him with much energy."
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes, we are,” replied J. T. modestly; “but we had better make haste.”"
"x83",""
"x83","Though Michel Ardan and he had crossed the plains still wet with dew,"
"x83","and had taken the shortest route over creeks and ricefields, they could"
"x83","not reach Skersnaw in under five hours and a half."
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane must have passed the border half an hour ago."
"x83",""
"x83","There was an old bushman working there, occupied in selling fagots from"
"x83","trees that had been leveled by his axe."
"x83",""
"x83","Maston ran toward him, saying, “Have you seen a man go into the wood,"
"x83","armed with a rifle? Barbicane, the president, my best friend?”"
"x83",""
"x83","The worthy secretary of the Gun Club thought that his president must be"
"x83","known by all the world. But the bushman did not seem to understand him."
"x83",""
"x83","“A hunter?” said Ardan."
"x83",""
"x83","“A hunter? Yes,” replied the bushman."
"x83",""
"x83","“Long ago?”"

"x83","“About an hour.”"

"x83","“Too late!” cried Maston."

"x83",""
"x83","“No!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Not one?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Not one! that hunter did not look as if he knew how to hunt!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“What is to be done?” said Maston."
"x83",""
"x83","“We must go into the wood, at the risk of getting a ball which is not"
"x83","intended for us.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Ah!” cried Maston, in a tone which could not be mistaken, “I would"
"x83","rather have twenty balls in my own head than one in Barbicane’s.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Forward, then,” said Ardan, pressing his companion’s hand."
"x83",""
"x83","A few moments later the two friends had disappeared in the copse. It"
"x83","was a dense thicket, in which rose huge cypresses, sycamores,"
"x83","tulip-trees, olives, tamarinds, oaks, and magnolias. These different"
"x83","trees had interwoven their branches into an inextricable maze, through"
"x83","which the eye could not penetrate. Michel Ardan and Maston walked side"
"x83","by side in silence through the tall grass, cutting themselves a path"
"x83","through the strong creepers, casting curious glances on the bushes, and"
"x83","momentarily expecting to hear the sound of rifles. As for the traces"
"x83","which Barbicane ought to have left of his passage through the wood,"
"x83","there was not a vestige of them visible: so they followed the barely"
"x83","perceptible paths along which Indians had tracked some enemy, and which"
"x83","the dense foliage darkly overshadowed."
"x83",""
"x83","After an hour spent in vain pursuit the two stopped in intensified"
"x83","anxiety."
"x83",""
"x83","“It must be all over,” said Maston, discouraged. “A man like Barbicane"
"x83","would not dodge with his enemy, or ensnare him, would not even"
"x83","maneuver! He is too open, too brave. He has gone straight ahead, right"
"x83","into the danger, and doubtless far enough from the bushman for the wind"
"x83","to prevent his hearing the report of the rifles.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“But surely,” replied Michel Ardan, “since we entered the wood we"
"x83","should have heard!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“And what if we came too late?” cried Maston in tones of despair."
"x83",""
"x83","For once Ardan had no reply to make, he and Maston resuming their walk"
"x83","in silence. From time to time, indeed, they raised great shouts,"
"x83","calling alternately Barbicane and Nicholl, neither of whom, however,"
"x83","answered their cries. Only the birds, awakened by the sound, flew past"
"x83","them and disappeared among the branches, while some frightened deer"
"x83","fled precipitately before them."
"x83",""
"x83","For another hour their search was continued. The greater part of the"
"x83","wood had been explored. There was nothing to reveal the presence of the"
"x83","combatants. The information of the bushman was after all doubtful, and"
"x83","Ardan was about to propose their abandoning this useless pursuit, when"
"x83","all at once Maston stopped."

"x83","was a poor little bird, uttering pitiful cries, while it vainly"
"x83","struggled to escape. The bird-catcher who had laid this snare was no"
"x83","human being, but a venomous spider, peculiar to that country, as large"
"x83","as a pigeon’s egg, and armed with enormous claws. The hideous creature,"
"x83","instead of rushing on its prey, had beaten a sudden retreat and taken"
"x83","refuge in the upper branches of the tulip-tree, for a formidable enemy"
"x83","menaced its stronghold."

"x83","Here, then, was Nicholl, his gun on the ground, forgetful of danger,"

"x83","There was in “the situation” somewhat of the ridiculous, something"
"x83","quite unexpected; Michel Ardan saw this, and determined to effect a"

"x83",""
"x83","“My good friends,” said he, with his most bewitching smile, “this is"
"x83","nothing but a misunderstanding. Nothing more! well! to prove that it is"

"x83","“What?” exclaimed J. T. Maston, stupefied."

"x83","The two rivals, on this sudden proposal, looked steadily at each other."

"x83","THE NEW CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","That same day all America heard of the affair of Captain Nicholl and"
"x83","President Barbicane, as well as its singular _denouement_. From that"
"x83","day forth, Michel Ardan had not one moment’s rest. Deputations from all"
"x83","corners of the Union harassed him without cessation or intermission. He"
"x83","was compelled to receive them all, whether he would or no. How many"
"x83","hands he shook, how many people he was “hail-fellow-well-met” with, it"
"x83","is impossible to guess! Such a triumphal result would have intoxicated"
"x83","any other man; but he managed to keep himself in a state of delightful"
"x83","_semi_-tipsiness."
"x83",""
"x83","Among the deputations of all kinds which assailed him, that of “The"
"x83","Lunatics” were careful not to forget what they owed to the future"
"x83","conqueror of the moon. One day, certain of these poor people, so"
"x83","numerous in America, came to call upon him, and requested permission to"
"x83","return with him to their native country."
"x83",""
"x83","“Singular hallucination!” said he to Barbicane, after having dismissed"
"x83","the deputation with promises to convey numbers of messages to friends"
"x83","in the moon. “Do you believe in the influence of the moon upon"
"x83","distempers?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Scarcely!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“No more do I, despite some remarkable recorded facts of history. For"
"x83","instance, during an epidemic in 1693, a large number of persons died at"
"x83","the very moment of an eclipse. The celebrated Bacon always fainted"
"x83","during an eclipse. Charles VI relapsed six times into madness during"
"x83","the year 1399, sometimes during the new, sometimes during the full"
"x83","moon. Gall observed that insane persons underwent an accession of their"
"x83","disorder twice in every month, at the epochs of new and full moon. In"
"x83","fact, numerous observations made upon fevers, somnambulisms, and other"
"x83","human maladies, seem to prove that the moon does exercise some"
"x83","mysterious influence upon man.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“But the how and the wherefore?” asked Barbicane."
"x83",""
"x83","“Well, I can only give you the answer which Arago borrowed from"
"x83","Plutarch, which is nineteen centuries old. ‘Perhaps the stories are not"
"x83","true!’”"
"x83",""
"x83","In the height of his triumph, Michel Ardan had to encounter all the"
"x83","annoyances incidental to a man of celebrity. Managers of entertainments"
"x83","wanted to exhibit him. Barnum offered him a million dollars to make a"
"x83","tour of the United States in his show. As for his photographs, they"
"x83","were sold of all size, and his portrait taken in every imaginable"
"x83","posture. More than half a million copies were disposed of in an"
"x83","incredibly short space of time."
"x83",""
"x83","But it was not only the men who paid him homage, but the women as well."
"x83","He might have married well a hundred times over, if he had been willing"
"x83","to settle in life. The old maids, in particular, of forty years and"
"x83","upward, and dry in proportion, devoured his photographs day and night."
"x83","They would have married him by hundreds, even if he had imposed upon"
"x83","them the condition of accompanying him into space. He had, however, no"
"x83","intention of transplanting a race of Franco-Americans upon the surface"
"x83","of the moon."
"x83",""
"x83","He therefore declined all offers."
"x83",""
"x83","As soon as he could withdraw from these somewhat embarrassing"
"x83","demonstrations, he went, accompanied by his friends, to pay a visit to"
"x83","the Columbiad. He was highly gratified by his inspection, and made the"
"x83","descent to the bottom of the tube of this gigantic machine which was"
"x83","presently to launch him to the regions of the moon. It is necessary"
"x83","here to mention a proposal of J. T. Maston’s. When the secretary of the"
"x83","Gun Club found that Barbicane and Nicholl accepted the proposal of"
"x83","Michel Ardan, he determined to join them, and make one of a smug party"
"x83","of four. So one day he determined to be admitted as one of the"
"x83","travelers. Barbicane, pained at having to refuse him, gave him clearly"
"x83","to understand that the projectile could not possibly contain so many"
"x83","passengers. Maston, in despair, went in search of Michel Ardan, who"
"x83","counseled him to resign himself to the situation, adding one or two"
"x83","arguments _ad hominem_."
"x83",""
"x83","“You see, old fellow,” he said, “you must not take what I say in bad"
"x83","part; but really, between ourselves, you are in too incomplete a"
"x83","condition to appear in the moon!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Incomplete?” shrieked the valiant invalid."
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes, my dear fellow! imagine our meeting some of the inhabitants up"
"x83","there! Would you like to give them such a melancholy notion of what"
"x83","goes on down here? to teach them what war is, to inform them that we"
"x83","employ our time chiefly in devouring each other, in smashing arms and"
"x83","legs, and that too on a globe which is capable of supporting a hundred"
"x83","billions of inhabitants, and which actually does contain nearly two"
"x83","hundred millions? Why, my worthy friend, we should have to turn you out"
"x83","of doors!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“But still, if you arrive there in pieces, you will be as incomplete as"
"x83","I am.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Unquestionably,” replied Michel Ardan; “but we shall not.”"
"x83",""
"x83","In fact, a preparatory experiment, tried on the 18th of October, had"
"x83","yielded the best results and caused the most well-grounded hopes of"
"x83","success. Barbicane, desirous of obtaining some notion of the effect of"
"x83","the shock at the moment of the projectile’s departure, had procured a"
"x83","38-inch mortar from the arsenal of Pensacola. He had this placed on the"
"x83","bank of Hillisborough Roads, in order that the shell might fall back"
"x83","into the sea, and the shock be thereby destroyed. His object was to"
"x83","ascertain the extent of the shock of departure, and not that of the"
"x83","return."
"x83",""
"x83","A hollow projectile had been prepared for this curious experiment. A"
"x83","thick padding fastened upon a kind of elastic network, made of the best"
"x83","steel, lined the inside of the walls. It was a veritable _nest_ most"
"x83","carefully wadded."
"x83",""
"x83","“What a pity I can’t find room in there,” said J. T. Maston, regretting"
"x83","that his height did not allow of his trying the adventure."
"x83",""
"x83","Within this shell were shut up a large cat, and a squirrel belonging to"
"x83","J. T. Maston, and of which he was particularly fond. They were"
"x83","desirous, however, of ascertaining how this little animal, least of all"
"x83","others subject to giddiness, would endure this experimental voyage."
"x83",""
"x83","The mortar was charged with 160 pounds of powder, and the shell placed"
"x83","in the chamber. On being fired, the projectile rose with great"
"x83","velocity, described a majestic parabola, attained a height of about a"
"x83","thousand feet, and with a graceful curve descended in the midst of the"
"x83","vessels that lay there at anchor."
"x83",""
"x83","Without a moment’s loss of time a small boat put off in the direction"
"x83","of its fall; some divers plunged into the water and attached ropes to"
"x83","the handles of the shell, which was quickly dragged on board. Five"
"x83","minutes did not elapse between the moment of enclosing the animals and"
"x83","that of unscrewing the coverlid of their prison."
"x83",""
"x83","Ardan, Barbicane, Maston, and Nicholl were present on board the boat,"
"x83","and assisted at the operation with an interest which may readily be"
"x83","comprehended. Hardly had the shell been opened when the cat leaped out,"
"x83","slightly bruised, but full of life, and exhibiting no signs whatever of"
"x83","having made an aerial expedition. No trace, however, of the squirrel"
"x83","could be discovered. The truth at last became apparent—the cat had"
"x83","eaten its fellow-traveler!"
"x83",""
"x83","J. T. Maston grieved much for the loss of his poor squirrel, and"
"x83","proposed to add its case to that of other martyrs to science."
"x83",""
"x83","After this experiment all hesitation, all fear disappeared. Besides,"
"x83","Barbicane’s plans would ensure greater perfection for his projectile,"
"x83","and go far to annihilate altogether the effects of the shock. Nothing"
"x83","now remained but to go!"
"x83",""
"x83","Two days later Michel Ardan received a message from the President of"
"x83","the United States, an honor of which he showed himself especially"
"x83","sensible."

"x83","After the example of his illustrious fellow-countryman, the Marquis de"

"x83","THE PROJECTILE-VEHICLE"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","On the completion of the Columbiad the public interest centered in the"
"x83","projectile itself, the vehicle which was destined to carry the three"
"x83","hardy adventurers into space."
"x83",""
"x83","The new plans had been sent to Breadwill and Co., of Albany, with the"
"x83","request for their speedy execution. The projectile was consequently"
"x83","cast on the 2nd of November, and immediately forwarded by the Eastern"
"x83","Railway to Stones Hill, which it reached without accident on the 10th"
"x83","of that month, where Michel Ardan, Barbicane, and Nicholl were waiting"
"x83","impatiently for it."
"x83",""
"x83","The projectile had now to be filled to the depth of three feet with a"
"x83","bed of water, intended to support a water-tight wooden disc, which"
"x83","worked easily within the walls of the projectile. It was upon this kind"
"x83","of raft that the travelers were to take their place. This body of water"
"x83","was divided by horizontal partitions, which the shock of the departure"
"x83","would have to break in succession. Then each sheet of the water, from"
"x83","the lowest to the highest, running off into escape tubes toward the top"
"x83","of the projectile, constituted a kind of spring; and the wooden disc,"
"x83","supplied with extremely powerful plugs, could not strike the lowest"
"x83","plate except after breaking successively the different partitions."
"x83","Undoubtedly the travelers would still have to encounter a violent"
"x83","recoil after the complete escapement of the water; but the first shock"
"x83","would be almost entirely destroyed by this powerful spring. The upper"
"x83","parts of the walls were lined with a thick padding of leather, fastened"
"x83","upon springs of the best steel, behind which the escape tubes were"
"x83","completely concealed; thus all imaginable precautions had been taken"
"x83","for averting the first shock; and if they did get crushed, they must,"
"x83","as Michel Ardan said, be made of very bad materials."
"x83",""
"x83","The entrance into this metallic tower was by a narrow aperture"
"x83","contrived in the wall of the cone. This was hermetically closed by a"
"x83","plate of aluminum, fastened internally by powerful screw-pressure. The"
"x83","travelers could therefore quit their prison at pleasure, as soon as"
"x83","they should reach the moon."
"x83",""
"x83","Light and view were given by means of four thick lenticular glass"
"x83","scuttles, two pierced in the circular wall itself, the third in the"
"x83","bottom, the fourth in the top. These scuttles then were protected"
"x83","against the shock of departure by plates let into solid grooves, which"
"x83","could easily be opened outward by unscrewing them from the inside."
"x83","Reservoirs firmly fixed contained water and the necessary provisions;"
"x83","and fire and light were procurable by means of gas, contained in a"
"x83","special reservoir under a pressure of several atmospheres. They had"
"x83","only to turn a tap, and for six hours the gas would light and warm this"
"x83","comfortable vehicle."
"x83",""
"x83","There now remained only the question of air; for allowing for the"
"x83","consumption of air by Barbicane, his two companions, and two dogs which"
"x83","he proposed taking with him, it was necessary to renew the air of the"
"x83","projectile. Now air consists principally of twenty-one parts of oxygen"
"x83","and seventy-nine of nitrogen. The lungs absorb the oxygen, which is"
"x83","indispensable for the support of life, and reject the nitrogen. The air"
"x83","expired loses nearly five per cent. of the former and contains nearly"
"x83","an equal volume of carbonic acid, produced by the combustion of the"
"x83","elements of the blood. In an air-tight enclosure, then, after a certain"
"x83","time, all the oxygen of the air will be replaced by the carbonic acid—a"
"x83","gas fatal to life. There were two things to be done then—first, to"
"x83","replace the absorbed oxygen; secondly, to destroy the expired carbonic"
"x83","acid; both easy enough to do, by means of chlorate of potassium and"
"x83","caustic potash. The former is a salt which appears under the form of"
"x83","white crystals; when raised to a temperature of 400 degrees it is"
"x83","transformed into chlorure of potassium, and the oxygen which it"
"x83","contains is entirely liberated. Now twenty-eight pounds of chlorate of"
"x83","potassium produces seven pounds of oxygen, or 2,400 litres—the quantity"
"x83","necessary for the travelers during twenty-four hours."
"x83",""
"x83","Caustic potash has a great affinity for carbonic acid; and it is"
"x83","sufficient to shake it in order for it to seize upon the acid and form"
"x83","bicarbonate of potassium. By these two means they would be enabled to"
"x83","restore to the vitiated air its life- supporting properties."
"x83",""
"x83","It is necessary, however, to add that the experiments had hitherto been"
"x83","made _in anima vili_. Whatever its scientific accuracy was, they were"
"x83","at present ignorant how it would answer with human beings. The honor of"
"x83","putting it to the proof was energetically claimed by J. T. Maston."
"x83",""
"x83","“Since I am not to go,” said the brave artillerist, “I may at least"
"x83","live for a week in the projectile.”"
"x83",""
"x83","It would have been hard to refuse him; so they consented to his wish. A"
"x83","sufficient quantity of chlorate of potassium and of caustic potash was"
"x83","placed at his disposal, together with provisions for eight days. And"
"x83","having shaken hands with his friends, on the 12th of November, at six"
"x83","o’clock A.M., after strictly informing them not to open his prison"
"x83","before the 20th, at six o’clock P.M., he slid down the projectile, the"
"x83","plate of which was at once hermetically sealed. What did he do with"
"x83","himself during that week? They could get no information. The thickness"
"x83","of the walls of the projectile prevented any sound reaching from the"
"x83","inside to the outside. On the 20th of November, at six P.M. exactly,"
"x83","the plate was opened. The friends of J. T. Maston had been all along in"

"x83","CHAPTER XXIV."
"x83","THE TELESCOPE OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","On the 20th of October in the preceding year, after the close of the"
"x83","subscription, the president of the Gun Club had credited the"
"x83","Observatory of Cambridge with the necessary sums for the construction"
"x83","of a gigantic optical instrument. This instrument was designed for the"
"x83","purpose of rendering visible on the surface of the moon any object"
"x83","exceeding nine feet in diameter."
"x83",""
"x83","At the period when the Gun Club essayed their great experiment, such"
"x83","instruments had reached a high degree of perfection, and produced some"
"x83","magnificent results. Two telescopes in particular, at this time, were"
"x83","possessed of remarkable power and of gigantic dimensions. The first,"
"x83","constructed by Herschel, was thirty-six feet in length, and had an"
"x83","object-glass of four feet six inches; it possessed a magnifying power"
"x83","of 6,000. The second was raised in Ireland, in Parsonstown Park, and"
"x83","belongs to Lord Rosse. The length of this tube is forty-eight feet, and"
"x83","the diameter of its object-glass six feet; it magnifies 6,400 times,"
"x83","and required an immense erection of brick work and masonry for the"
"x83","purpose of working it, its weight being twelve and a half tons."
"x83",""
"x83","Still, despite these colossal dimensions, the actual enlargements"
"x83","scarcely exceeded 6,000 times in round numbers; consequently, the moon"
"x83","was brought within no nearer an apparent distance than thirty-nine"
"x83","miles; and objects of less than sixty feet in diameter, unless they"
"x83","were of very considerable length, were still imperceptible."
"x83",""
"x83","In the present case, dealing with a projectile nine feet in diameter"
"x83","and fifteen feet long, it became necessary to bring the moon within an"
"x83","apparent distance of five miles at most; and for that purpose to"
"x83","establish a magnifying power of 48,000 times."
"x83",""
"x83","Such was the question proposed to the Observatory of Cambridge, There"
"x83","was no lack of funds; the difficulty was purely one of construction."
"x83",""
"x83","After considerable discussion as to the best form and principle of the"
"x83","proposed instrument the work was finally commenced. According to the"
"x83","calculations of the Observatory of Cambridge, the tube of the new"
"x83","reflector would require to be 280 feet in length, and the object-glass"
"x83","sixteen feet in diameter. Colossal as these dimensions may appear, they"
"x83","were diminutive in comparison with the 10,000 foot telescope proposed"
"x83","by the astronomer Hooke only a few years ago!"
"x83",""
"x83","Regarding the choice of locality, that matter was promptly determined."
"x83","The object was to select some lofty mountain, and there are not many of"
"x83","these in the United States. In fact there are but two chains of"
"x83","moderate elevation, between which runs the magnificent Mississippi, the"
"x83","“king of rivers” as these Republican Yankees delight to call it."
"x83",""
"x83","Eastwards rise the Appalachians, the very highest point of which, in"
"x83","New Hampshire, does not exceed the very moderate altitude of 5,600"
"x83","feet."
"x83",""
"x83","On the west, however, rise the Rocky Mountains, that immense range"
"x83","which, commencing at the Straights of Magellan, follows the western"
"x83","coast of Southern America under the name of the Andes or the"
"x83","Cordilleras, until it crosses the Isthmus of Panama, and runs up the"
"x83","whole of North America to the very borders of the Polar Sea. The"
"x83","highest elevation of this range still does not exceed 10,700 feet. With"
"x83","this elevation, nevertheless, the Gun Club were compelled to be"
"x83","content, inasmuch as they had determined that both telescope and"
"x83","Columbiad should be erected within the limits of the Union. All the"
"x83","necessary apparatus was consequently sent on to the summit of Long’s"
"x83","Peak, in the territory of Missouri."
"x83",""
"x83","Neither pen nor language can describe the difficulties of all kinds"
"x83","which the American engineers had to surmount, of the prodigies of"
"x83","daring and skill which they accomplished. They had to raise enormous"
"x83","stones, massive pieces of wrought iron, heavy corner-clamps and huge"
"x83","portions of cylinder, with an object-glass weighing nearly 30,000"
"x83","pounds, above the line of perpetual snow for more than 10,000 feet in"
"x83","height, after crossing desert prairies, impenetrable forests, fearful"
"x83","rapids, far from all centers of population, and in the midst of savage"
"x83","regions, in which every detail of life becomes an almost insoluble"
"x83","problem. And yet, notwithstanding these innumerable obstacles, American"
"x83","genius triumphed. In less than a year after the commencement of the"
"x83","works, toward the close of September, the gigantic reflector rose into"
"x83","the air to a height of 280 feet. It was raised by means of an enormous"
"x83","iron crane; an ingenious mechanism allowed it to be easily worked"
"x83","toward all the points of the heavens, and to follow the stars from the"
"x83","one horizon to the other during their journey through the heavens."
"x83",""
"x83","It had cost $400,000. The first time it was directed toward the moon"
"x83","the observers evinced both curiosity and anxiety. What were they about"
"x83","to discover in the field of this telescope which magnified objects"
"x83","48,000 times? Would they perceive peoples, herds of lunar animals,"
"x83","towns, lakes, seas? No! there was nothing which science had not already"
"x83","discovered! and on all the points of its disc the volcanic nature of"
"x83","the moon became determinable with the utmost precision."
"x83",""
"x83","But the telescope of the Rocky Mountains, before doing its duty to the"
"x83","Gun Club, rendered immense services to astronomy. Thanks to its"
"x83","penetrative power, the depths of the heavens were sounded to the utmost"
"x83","extent; the apparent diameter of a great number of stars was accurately"
"x83","measured; and Mr. Clark, of the Cambridge staff, resolved the Crab"
"x83","nebula in Taurus, which the reflector of Lord Rosse had never been able"
"x83","to decompose."

"x83","FINAL DETAILS"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","It was the 22nd of November; the departure was to take place in ten"
"x83","days. One operation alone remained to be accomplished to bring all to a"
"x83","happy termination; an operation delicate and perilous, requiring"
"x83","infinite precautions, and against the success of which Captain Nicholl"
"x83","had laid his third bet. It was, in fact, nothing less than the loading"
"x83","of the Columbiad, and the introduction into it of 400,000 pounds of"
"x83","gun-cotton. Nicholl had thought, not perhaps without reason, that the"
"x83","handling of such formidable quantities of pyroxyle would, in all"
"x83","probability, involve a grave catastrophe; and at any rate, that this"
"x83","immense mass of eminently inflammable matter would inevitably ignite"
"x83","when submitted to the pressure of the projectile."
"x83",""
"x83","There were indeed dangers accruing as before from the carelessness of"
"x83","the Americans, but Barbicane had set his heart on success, and took all"
"x83","possible precautions. In the first place, he was very careful as to the"
"x83","transportation of the gun-cotton to Stones Hill. He had it conveyed in"
"x83","small quantities, carefully packed in sealed cases. These were brought"
"x83","by rail from Tampa Town to the camp, and from thence were taken to the"
"x83","Columbiad by barefooted workmen, who deposited them in their places by"
"x83","means of cranes placed at the orifice of the cannon. No steam-engine"
"x83","was permitted to work, and every fire was extinguished within two miles"
"x83","of the works."
"x83",""
"x83","Even in November they feared to work by day, lest the sun’s rays acting"
"x83","on the gun-cotton might lead to unhappy results. This led to their"
"x83","working at night, by light produced in a vacuum by means of Ruhmkorff’s"
"x83","apparatus, which threw an artificial brightness into the depths of the"
"x83","Columbiad. There the cartridges were arranged with the utmost"
"x83","regularity, connected by a metallic thread, destined to communicate to"
"x83","them all simultaneously the electric spark, by which means this mass of"

"x83","By the 28th of November eight hundred cartridges had been placed in the"
"x83","bottom of the Columbiad. So far the operation had been successful! But"
"x83","what confusion, what anxieties, what struggles were undergone by"
"x83","President Barbicane! In vain had he refused admission to Stones Hill;"
"x83","every day the inquisitive neighbors scaled the palisades, some even"
"x83","carrying their imprudence to the point of smoking while surrounded by"
"x83","bales of gun-cotton. Barbicane was in a perpetual state of alarm. J. T."
"x83","Maston seconded him to the best of his ability, by giving vigorous"
"x83","chase to the intruders, and carefully picking up the still lighted"
"x83","cigar ends which the Yankees threw about. A somewhat difficult task!"
"x83","seeing that more than 300,000 persons were gathered round the"
"x83","enclosure. Michel Ardan had volunteered to superintend the transport of"
"x83","the cartridges to the mouth of the Columbiad; but the president, having"
"x83","surprised him with an enormous cigar in his mouth, while he was hunting"
"x83","out the rash spectators to whom he himself offered so dangerous an"
"x83","example, saw that he could not trust this fearless smoker, and was"
"x83","therefore obliged to mount a special guard over him."
"x83",""
"x83","At last, Providence being propitious, this wonderful loading came to a"
"x83","happy termination, Captain Nicholl’s third bet being thus lost. It"
"x83","remained now to introduce the projectile into the Columbiad, and to"
"x83","place it on its soft bed of gun-cotton."
"x83",""
"x83","But before doing this, all those things necessary for the journey had"
"x83","to be carefully arranged in the projectile vehicle. These necessaries"
"x83","were numerous; and had Ardan been allowed to follow his own wishes,"
"x83","there would have been no space remaining for the travelers. It is"
"x83","impossible to conceive of half the things this charming Frenchman"
"x83","wished to convey to the moon. A veritable stock of useless trifles! But"
"x83","Barbicane interfered and refused admission to anything not absolutely"
"x83","needed. Several thermometers, barometers, and telescopes were packed in"
"x83","the instrument case."
"x83",""
"x83","The travelers being desirous of examing the moon carefully during their"
"x83","voyage, in order to facilitate their studies, they took with them Boeer"
"x83","and Moeller’s excellent _Mappa Selenographica_, a masterpiece of"
"x83","patience and observation, which they hoped would enable them to"
"x83","identify those physical features in the moon, with which they were"
"x83","acquainted. This map reproduced with scrupulous fidelity the smallest"
"x83","details of the lunar surface which faces the earth; the mountains,"
"x83","valleys, craters, peaks, and ridges were all represented, with their"
"x83","exact dimensions, relative positions, and names; from the mountains"
"x83","Doerfel and Leibnitz on the eastern side of the disc, to the _Mare"
"x83","frigoris_ of the North Pole."
"x83",""
"x83","They took also three rifles and three fowling-pieces, and a large"
"x83","quantity of balls, shot, and powder."
"x83",""
"x83","“We cannot tell whom we shall have to deal with,” said Michel Ardan."
"x83","“Men or beasts may possibly object to our visit. It is only wise to"
"x83","take all precautions.”"
"x83",""
"x83","These defensive weapons were accompanied by pickaxes, crowbars, saws,"
"x83","and other useful implements, not to mention clothing adapted to every"
"x83","temperature, from that of polar regions to that of the torrid zone."
"x83",""
"x83","Ardan wished to convey a number of animals of different sorts, not"
"x83","indeed a pair of every known species, as he could not see the necessity"
"x83","of acclimatizing serpents, tigers, alligators, or any other noxious"
"x83","beasts in the moon. “Nevertheless,” he said to Barbicane, “some"
"x83","valuable and useful beasts, bullocks, cows, horses, and donkeys, would"
"x83","bear the journey very well, and would also be very useful to us.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“I dare say, my dear Ardan,” replied the president, “but our"
"x83","projectile-vehicle is no Noah’s ark, from which it differs both in"
"x83","dimensions and object. Let us confine ourselves to possibilities.”"
"x83",""
"x83","After a prolonged discussion, it was agreed that the travelers should"
"x83","restrict themselves to a sporting-dog belonging to Nicholl, and to a"
"x83","large Newfoundland. Several packets of seeds were also included among"
"x83","the necessaries. Michel Ardan, indeed, was anxious to add some sacks"
"x83","full of earth to sow them in; as it was, he took a dozen shrubs"
"x83","carefully wrapped up in straw to plant in the moon."
"x83",""
"x83","The important question of provisions still remained; it being necessary"
"x83","to provide against the possibility of their finding the moon absolutely"
"x83","barren. Barbicane managed so successfully, that he supplied them with"
"x83","sufficient rations for a year. These consisted of preserved meats and"
"x83","vegetables, reduced by strong hydraulic pressure to the smallest"
"x83","possible dimensions. They were also supplied with brandy, and took"
"x83","water enough for two months, being confident, from astronomical"
"x83","observations, that there was no lack of water on the moon’s surface. As"
"x83","to provisions, doubtless the inhabitants of the _earth_ would find"
"x83","nourishment somewhere in the _moon_. Ardan never questioned this;"
"x83","indeed, had he done so, he would never have undertaken the journey."
"x83",""
"x83","“Besides,” he said one day to his friends, “we shall not be completely"
"x83","abandoned by our terrestrial friends; they will take care not to forget"
"x83","us.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“No, indeed!” replied J. T. Maston."
"x83",""
"x83","“Nothing would be simpler,” replied Ardan; “the Columbiad will be"
"x83","always there. Well! whenever the moon is in a favorable condition as to"
"x83","the zenith, if not to the perigee, that is to say about once a year,"
"x83","could you not send us a shell packed with provisions, which we might"
"x83","expect on some appointed day?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Hurrah! hurrah!” cried J. T. Matson; “what an ingenious fellow! what a"

"x83",""
"x83","“I shall reckon upon you! Then, you see, we shall receive news"
"x83","regularly from the earth, and we shall indeed be stupid if we hit upon"
"x83","no plan for communicating with our good friends here!”"
"x83",""
"x83","These words inspired such confidence, that Michel Ardan carried all the"
"x83","Gun Club with him in his enthusiasm. What he said seemed so simple and"
"x83","so easy, so sure of success, that none could be so sordidly attached to"
"x83","this earth as to hesitate to follow the three travelers on their lunar"
"x83","expedition."

"x83","All being ready at last, it remained to place the projectile in the"

"x83","more than eighteen years must roll by before the moon would again"
"x83","present herself under the same conditions of zenith and perigee."
"x83",""
"x83","The weather was magnificent. Despite the approach of winter, the sun"
"x83","shone brightly, and bathed in its radiant light that earth which three"
"x83","of its denizens were about to abandon for a new world."
"x83",""
"x83","How many persons lost their rest on the night which preceded this"
"x83","long-expected day! All hearts beat with disquietude, save only the"
"x83","heart of Michel Ardan. That imperturbable personage came and went with"
"x83","his habitual business-like air, while nothing whatever denoted that any"
"x83","unusual matter preoccupied his mind."
"x83",""
"x83","After dawn, an innumerable multitude covered the prairie which extends,"
"x83","as far as the eye can reach, round Stones Hill. Every quarter of an"
"x83","hour the railway brought fresh accessions of sightseers; and, according"
"x83","to the statement of the Tampa Town _Observer_, not less than five"
"x83","millions of spectators thronged the soil of Florida."
"x83",""
"x83","For a whole month previously, the mass of these persons had bivouacked"
"x83","round the enclosure, and laid the foundations for a town which was"
"x83","afterward called “Ardan’s Town.” The whole plain was covered with huts,"
"x83","cottages, and tents. Every nation under the sun was represented there;"
"x83","and every language might be heard spoken at the same time. It was a"
"x83","perfect Babel re-enacted. All the various classes of American society"
"x83","were mingled together in terms of absolute equality. Bankers, farmers,"
"x83","sailors, cotton-planters, brokers, merchants, watermen, magistrates,"
"x83","elbowed each other in the most free-and-easy way. Louisiana Creoles"
"x83","fraternized with farmers from Indiana; Kentucky and Tennessee gentlemen"
"x83","and haughty Virginians conversed with trappers and the half-savages of"
"x83","the lakes and butchers from Cincinnati. Broad-brimmed white hats and"
"x83","Panamas, blue-cotton trousers, light-colored stockings, cambric frills,"
"x83","were all here displayed; while upon shirt-fronts, wristbands, and"
"x83","neckties, upon every finger, even upon the very ears, they wore an"
"x83","assortment of rings, shirt-pins, brooches, and trinkets, of which the"
"x83","value only equaled the execrable taste. Women, children, and servants,"
"x83","in equally expensive dress, surrounded their husbands, fathers, or"
"x83","masters, who resembled the patriarchs of tribes in the midst of their"
"x83","immense households."
"x83",""
"x83","At meal-times all fell to work upon the dishes peculiar to the Southern"

"x83","vociferations that resounded through the bars and taverns decorated"
"x83","with glasses, tankards, and bottles of marvelous shape, mortars for"
"x83","pounding sugar, and bundles of straws! “Mint-julep” roars one of the"
"x83","barmen; “Claret sangaree!” shouts another; “Cocktail!” “Brandy-smash!”"
"x83","“Real mint-julep in the new style!” All these cries intermingled"
"x83","produced a bewildering and deafening hubbub."
"x83",""
"x83","But on this day, 1st of December, such sounds were rare. No one thought"
"x83","of eating or drinking, and at four P.M. there were vast numbers of"
"x83","spectators who had not even taken their customary lunch! And, a still"
"x83","more significant fact, even the national passion for play seemed"
"x83","quelled for the time under the general excitement of the hour."
"x83",""
"x83","Up till nightfall, a dull, noiseless agitation, such as precedes great"

"x83","However, about seven o’clock, the heavy silence was dissipated. The"
"x83","moon rose above the horizon. Millions of hurrahs hailed her appearance."
"x83","She was punctual to the rendezvous, and shouts of welcome greeted her"
"x83","on all sides, as her pale beams shone gracefully in the clear heavens."
"x83","At this moment the three intrepid travelers appeared. This was the"

"x83","Ardan, always easy, dressed in thorough traveler’s costume, leathern"
"x83","gaiters on his legs, pouch by his side, in loose velvet suit, cigar in"
"x83","mouth, was full of inexhaustible gayety, laughing, joking, playing"

"x83","his dear president."
"x83",""
"x83","“Can I not go?” he said, “there is still time!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Impossible, old fellow!” replied Barbicane. A few moments later, the"
"x83","three fellow-travelers had ensconced themselves in the projectile, and"
"x83","screwed down the plate which covered the entrance-aperture. The mouth"
"x83","of the Columbiad, now completely disencumbered, was open entirely to"
"x83","the sky."
"x83",""
"x83","The moon advanced upward in a heaven of the purest clearness,"
"x83","outshining in her passage the twinkling light of the stars. She passed"
"x83","over the constellation of the Twins, and was now nearing the halfway"
"x83","point between the horizon and the zenith. A terrible silence weighed"
"x83","upon the entire scene! Not a breath of wind upon the earth! not a sound"
"x83","of breathing from the countless chests of the spectators! Their hearts"
"x83","seemed afraid to beat! All eyes were fixed upon the yawning mouth of"
"x83","the Columbiad."

"x83","Murchison followed with his eye the hand of his chronometer. It wanted"
"x83","scarce forty seconds to the moment of departure, but each second seemed"
"x83","to last an age! At the twentieth there was a general shudder, as it"
"x83","occurred to the minds of that vast assemblage that the bold travelers"

"x83","idea of the terrific sound! An immense spout of fire shot up from the"

"x83",""
"x83","LONG’S PEAK, December 12. To the Officers of the Observatory of"
"x83","Cambridge. The projectile discharged by the Columbiad at Stones Hill"
"x83","has been detected by Messrs. Belfast and J. T. Maston, 12th of"
"x83","December, at 8:47 P.M., the moon having entered her last quarter. This"
"x83","projectile has not arrived at its destination. It has passed by the"
"x83","side; but sufficiently near to be retained by the lunar attraction."
"x83",""
"x83","The rectilinear movement has thus become changed into a circular motion"
"x83","of extreme velocity, and it is now pursuing an elliptical orbit round"
"x83","the moon, of which it has become a true satellite."
"x83",""
"x83","The elements of this new star we have as yet been unable to determine;"
"x83","we do not yet know the velocity of its passage. The distance which"
"x83","separates it from the surface of the moon may be estimated at about"
"x83","2,833 miles."
"x83",""
"x83","However, two hypotheses come here into our consideration."
"x83",""
"x83","1. Either the attraction of the moon will end by drawing them into"
"x83","itself, and the travelers will attain their destination; or,"
"x83",""
"x83","2. The projectile, following an immutable law, will continue to"
"x83","gravitate round the moon till the end of time."
"x83",""
"x83","At some future time, our observations will be able to determine this"
"x83","point, but till then the experiment of the Gun Club can have no other"
"x83","result than to have provided our solar system with a new star. J."

"x83","When the dispatch from Long’s Peak had once become known, there was but"

"x83","PRELIMINARY CHAPTER"
"x83","THE FIRST PART OF THIS WORK, AND SERVING AS A PREFACE TO THE SECOND"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","During the year 186-, the whole world was greatly excited by a"
"x83","scientific experiment unprecedented in the annals of science. The"
"x83","members of the Gun Club, a circle of artillerymen formed at Baltimore"
"x83","after the American war, conceived the idea of putting themselves in"
"x83","communication with the moon!—yes, with the moon—by sending to her a"
"x83","projectile. Their president, Barbicane, the promoter of the enterprise,"
"x83","having consulted the astronomers of the Cambridge Observatory upon the"
"x83","subject, took all necessary means to ensure the success of this"
"x83","extraordinary enterprise, which had been declared practicable by the"
"x83","majority of competent judges. After setting on foot a public"
"x83","subscription, which realized nearly L1,200,000, they began the gigantic"
"x83","work."
"x83",""
"x83","According to the advice forwarded from the members of the Observatory,"
"x83","the gun destined to launch the projectile had to be fixed in a country"
"x83","situated between the 0 and 28th degrees of north or south latitude, in"
"x83","order to aim at the moon when at the zenith; and its initiatory"
"x83","velocity was fixed at twelve thousand yards to the second. Launched on"
"x83","the 1st of December, at 10hrs. 46m. 40s. P.M., it ought to reach the"
"x83","moon four days after its departure, that is on the 5th of December, at"
"x83","midnight precisely, at the moment of her attaining her perigee, that is"
"x83","her nearest distance from the earth, which is exactly 86,410 leagues"
"x83","(French), or 238,833 miles mean distance (English)."
"x83",""
"x83","The principal members of the Gun Club, President Barbicane, Major"
"x83","Elphinstone, the secretary Joseph T. Maston, and other learned men,"
"x83","held several meetings, at which the shape and composition of the"
"x83","projectile were discussed, also the position and nature of the gun, and"
"x83","the quality and quantity of powder to be used. It was decided: First,"
"x83","that the projectile should be a shell made of aluminum with a diameter"
"x83","of 108 inches and a thickness of twelve inches to its walls; and should"
"x83","weigh 19,250 pounds. Second, that the gun should be a Columbiad cast in"
"x83","iron, 900 feet long, and run perpendicularly into the earth. Third,"
"x83","that the charge should contain 400,000 pounds of gun-cotton, which,"
"x83","giving out six billions of litres of gas in rear of the projectile,"
"x83","would easily carry it toward the orb of night."
"x83",""
"x83","These questions determined President Barbicane, assisted by Murchison"
"x83","the engineer, to choose a spot situated in Florida, in 27° 7′ North"
"x83","latitude, and 77° 3′ West (Greenwich) longitude. It was on this spot,"
"x83","after stupendous labor, that the Columbiad was cast with full success."
"x83","Things stood thus, when an incident took place which increased the"
"x83","interest attached to this great enterprise a hundredfold."
"x83",""
"x83","A Frenchman, an enthusiastic Parisian, as witty as he was bold, asked"
"x83","to be enclosed in the projectile, in order that he might reach the"
"x83","moon, and reconnoiter this terrestrial satellite. The name of this"
"x83","intrepid adventurer was Michel Ardan. He landed in America, was"
"x83","received with enthusiasm, held meetings, saw himself carried in"
"x83","triumph, reconciled President Barbicane to his mortal enemy, Captain"
"x83","Nicholl, and, as a token of reconciliation, persuaded them both to"
"x83","start with him in the projectile. The proposition being accepted, the"
"x83","shape of the projectile was slightly altered. It was made of a"
"x83","cylindro-conical form. This species of aerial car was lined with strong"
"x83","springs and partitions to deaden the shock of departure. It was"
"x83","provided with food for a year, water for some months, and gas for some"
"x83","days. A self-acting apparatus supplied the three travelers with air to"
"x83","breathe. At the same time, on one of the highest points of the Rocky"
"x83","Mountains, the Gun Club had a gigantic telescope erected, in order that"
"x83","they might be able to follow the course of the projectile through"
"x83","space. All was then ready."
"x83",""
"x83","On the 30th of November, at the hour fixed upon, from the midst of an"
"x83","extraordinary crowd of spectators, the departure took place, and for"
"x83","the first time, three human beings quitted the terrestrial globe, and"
"x83","launched into inter-planetary space with almost a certainty of reaching"
"x83","their destination. These bold travelers, Michel Ardan, President"
"x83","Barbicane, and Captain Nicholl, ought to make the passage in"
"x83","ninety-seven hours, thirteen minutes, and twenty seconds. Consequently,"
"x83","their arrival on the lunar disc could not take place until the 5th of"
"x83","December at twelve at night, at the exact moment when the moon should"
"x83","be full, and not on the 4th, as some badly informed journalists had"
"x83","announced."
"x83",""
"x83","But an unforeseen circumstance, viz., the detonation produced by the"
"x83","Columbiad, had the immediate effect of troubling the terrestrial"
"x83","atmosphere, by accumulating a large quantity of vapor, a phenomenon"
"x83","which excited universal indignation, for the moon was hidden from the"
"x83","eyes of the watchers for several nights."
"x83",""
"x83","The worthy Joseph T. Maston, the staunchest friend of the three"
"x83","travelers, started for the Rocky Mountains, accompanied by the Hon. J."
"x83","Belfast, director of the Cambridge Observatory, and reached the station"
"x83","of Long’s Peak, where the telescope was erected which brought the moon"
"x83","within an apparent distance of two leagues. The honorable secretary of"
"x83","the Gun Club wished himself to observe the vehicle of his daring"
"x83","friends."
"x83",""
"x83","The accumulation of the clouds in the atmosphere prevented all"
"x83","observation on the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th of December."
"x83","Indeed it was thought that all observations would have to be put off to"
"x83","the 3d of January in the following year; for the moon entering its last"
"x83","quarter on the 11th, would then only present an ever-decreasing portion"
"x83","of her disc, insufficient to allow of their following the course of the"
"x83","projectile."
"x83",""
"x83","At length, to the general satisfaction, a heavy storm cleared the"
"x83","atmosphere on the night of the 11th and 12th of December, and the moon,"
"x83","with half-illuminated disc, was plainly to be seen upon the black sky."
"x83",""
"x83","That very night a telegram was sent from the station of Long’s Peak by"
"x83","Joseph T. Maston and Belfast to the gentlemen of the Cambridge"
"x83","Observatory, announcing that on the 11th of December at 8h. 47m. P.M.,"
"x83","the projectile launched by the Columbiad of Stones Hill had been"
"x83","detected by Messrs. Belfast and Maston—that it had deviated from its"
"x83","course from some unknown cause, and had not reached its destination;"
"x83","but that it had passed near enough to be retained by the lunar"
"x83","attraction; that its rectilinear movement had been changed to a"
"x83","circular one, and that following an elliptical orbit round the star of"
"x83","night it had become its satellite. The telegram added that the elements"
"x83","of this new star had not yet been calculated; and indeed three"
"x83","observations made upon a star in three different positions are"
"x83","necessary to determine these elements. Then it showed that the distance"
"x83","separating the projectile from the lunar surface “might” be reckoned at"
"x83","about 2,833 miles."
"x83",""
"x83","It ended with the double hypothesis: either the attraction of the moon"
"x83","would draw it to herself, and the travelers thus attain their end; or"
"x83","that the projectile, held in one immutable orbit, would gravitate"
"x83","around the lunar disc to all eternity."
"x83",""
"x83","With such alternatives, what would be the fate of the travelers?"
"x83","Certainly they had food for some time. But supposing they did succeed"
"x83","in their rash enterprise, how would they return? Could they ever"
"x83","return? Should they hear from them? These questions, debated by the"
"x83","most learned pens of the day, strongly engrossed the public attention."
"x83",""
"x83","It is advisable here to make a remark which ought to be well considered"
"x83","by hasty observers. When a purely speculative discovery is announced to"
"x83","the public, it cannot be done with too much prudence. No one is obliged"
"x83","to discover either a planet, a comet, or a satellite; and whoever makes"
"x83","a mistake in such a case exposes himself justly to the derision of the"
"x83","mass. Far better is it to wait; and that is what the impatient Joseph"
"x83","T. Maston should have done before sending this telegram forth to the"
"x83","world, which, according to his idea, told the whole result of the"
"x83","enterprise. Indeed this telegram contained two sorts of errors, as was"
"x83","proved eventually. First, errors of observation, concerning the"
"x83","distance of the projectile from the surface of the moon, for on the"
"x83","11th of December it was impossible to see it; and what Joseph T. Maston"
"x83","had seen, or thought he saw, could not have been the projectile of the"
"x83","Columbiad. Second, errors of theory on the fate in store for the said"
"x83","projectile; for in making it a satellite of the moon, it was putting it"
"x83","in direct contradiction of all mechanical laws."
"x83",""
"x83","One single hypothesis of the observers of Long’s Peak could ever be"
"x83","realized, that which foresaw the case of the travelers (if still alive)"
"x83","uniting their efforts with the lunar attraction to attain the surface"
"x83","of the disc."
"x83",""
"x83","Now these men, as clever as they were daring, had survived the terrible"
"x83","shock consequent on their departure, and it is their journey in the"
"x83","projectile car which is here related in its most dramatic as well as in"
"x83","its most singular details. This recital will destroy many illusions and"
"x83","surmises; but it will give a true idea of the singular changes in store"
"x83","for such an enterprise; it will bring out the scientific instincts of"
"x83","Barbicane, the industrious resources of Nicholl, and the audacious"
"x83","humor of Michel Ardan. Besides this, it will prove that their worthy"
"x83","friend, Joseph T. Maston, was wasting his time, while leaning over the"
"x83","gigantic telescope he watched the course of the moon through the starry"
"x83","space."

"x83","CHAPTER I."
"x83","TWENTY MINUTES PAST TEN TO FORTY-SEVEN MINUTES PAST TEN P. M."
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","As ten o’clock struck, Michel Ardan, Barbicane, and Nicholl, took leave"
"x83","of the numerous friends they were leaving on the earth. The two dogs,"
"x83","destined to propagate the canine race on the lunar continents, were"
"x83","already shut up in the projectile."
"x83",""
"x83","The three travelers approached the orifice of the enormous cast-iron"
"x83","tube, and a crane let them down to the conical top of the projectile."
"x83","There, an opening made for the purpose gave them access to the aluminum"
"x83","car. The tackle belonging to the crane being hauled from outside, the"
"x83","mouth of the Columbiad was instantly disencumbered of its last"
"x83","supports."
"x83",""
"x83","Nicholl, once introduced with his companions inside the projectile,"
"x83","began to close the opening by means of a strong plate, held in position"
"x83","by powerful screws. Other plates, closely fitted, covered the"
"x83","lenticular glasses, and the travelers, hermetically enclosed in their"
"x83","metal prison, were plunged in profound darkness."
"x83",""
"x83","“And now, my dear companions,” said Michel Ardan, “let us make"
"x83","ourselves at home; I am a domesticated man and strong in housekeeping."
"x83","We are bound to make the best of our new lodgings, and make ourselves"
"x83","comfortable. And first let us try and see a little. Gas was not"
"x83","invented for moles.”"
"x83",""
"x83","So saying, the thoughtless fellow lit a match by striking it on the"
"x83","sole of his boot; and approached the burner fixed to the receptacle, in"
"x83","which the carbonized hydrogen, stored at high pressure, sufficed for"
"x83","the lighting and warming of the projectile for a hundred and forty-four"
"x83","hours, or six days and six nights. The gas caught fire, and thus"
"x83","lighted the projectile looked like a comfortable room with thickly"
"x83","padded walls, furnished with a circular divan, and a roof rounded in"
"x83","the shape of a dome."
"x83",""
"x83","Michel Ardan examined everything, and declared himself satisfied with"
"x83","his installation."
"x83",""
"x83","“It is a prison,” said he, “but a traveling prison; and, with the right"
"x83","of putting my nose to the window, I could well stand a lease of a"
"x83","hundred years. You smile, Barbicane. Have you any _arriere-pensee_? Do"
"x83","you say to yourself, ‘This prison may be our tomb?’ Tomb, perhaps;"
"x83","still I would not change it for Mahomet’s, which floats in space but"
"x83","never advances an inch!”"
"x83",""
"x83","While Michel Ardan was speaking, Barbicane and Nicholl were making"
"x83","their last preparations."
"x83",""
"x83","Nicholl’s chronometer marked twenty minutes past ten P.M. when the"
"x83","three travelers were finally enclosed in their projectile. This"
"x83","chronometer was set within the tenth of a second by that of Murchison"
"x83","the engineer. Barbicane consulted it."
"x83",""
"x83","“My friends,” said he, “it is twenty minutes past ten. At forty- seven"
"x83","minutes past ten Murchison will launch the electric spark on the wire"
"x83","which communicates with the charge of the Columbiad. At that precise"
"x83","moment we shall leave our spheroid. Thus we still have twenty-seven"
"x83","minutes to remain on the earth.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Twenty-six minutes thirteen seconds,” replied the methodical Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","“Well!” exclaimed Michel Ardan, in a good-humored tone, “much may be"
"x83","done in twenty-six minutes. The gravest questions of morals and"
"x83","politics may be discussed, and even solved. Twenty-six minutes well"
"x83","employed are worth more than twenty-six years in which nothing is done."
"x83","Some seconds of a Pascal or a Newton are more precious than the whole"
"x83","existence of a crowd of raw simpletons—”"

"x83","“twenty-four minutes in which to investigate—”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Michel,” said Barbicane, “during the passage we shall have plenty of"
"x83","time to investigate the most difficult questions. For the present we"
"x83","must occupy ourselves with our departure.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Are we not ready?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Doubtless; but there are still some precautions to be taken, to deaden"
"x83","as much as possible the first shock.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Have we not the water-cushions placed between the partition- breaks,"
"x83","whose elasticity will sufficiently protect us?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“I hope so, Michel,” replied Barbicane gently, “but I am not sure.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Ah, the joker!” exclaimed Michel Ardan. “He hopes!—He is not sure!—and"
"x83","he waits for the moment when we are encased to make this deplorable"
"x83","admission! I beg to be allowed to get out!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“And how?” asked Barbicane."
"x83",""
"x83","“Humph!” said Michel Ardan, “it is not easy; we are in the train, and"
"x83","the guard’s whistle will sound before twenty-four minutes are over.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Twenty,” said Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","For some moments the three travelers looked at each other. Then they"
"x83","began to examine the objects imprisoned with them."
"x83",""
"x83","“Everything is in its place,” said Barbicane. “We have now to decide"
"x83","how we can best place ourselves to resist the shock. Position cannot be"
"x83","an indifferent matter; and we must, as much as possible, prevent the"
"x83","rush of blood to the head.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Just so,” said Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","“Then,” replied Michel Ardan, ready to suit the action to the word,"
"x83","“let us put our heads down and our feet in the air, like the clowns in"
"x83","the grand circus.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“No,” said Barbicane, “let us stretch ourselves on our sides; we shall"
"x83","resist the shock better that way. Remember that, when the projectile"
"x83","starts, it matters little whether we are in it or before it; it amounts"
"x83","to much the same thing.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“If it is only ‘much the same thing,’ I may cheer up,” said Michel"
"x83","Ardan."
"x83",""
"x83","“Do you approve of my idea, Nicholl?” asked Barbicane."
"x83",""
"x83","“Entirely,” replied the captain. “We’ve still thirteen minutes and a"
"x83","half.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“That Nicholl is not a man,” exclaimed Michel; “he is a chronometer"
"x83","with seconds, an escape, and eight holes.”"
"x83",""
"x83","But his companions were not listening; they were taking up their last"
"x83","positions with the most perfect coolness. They were like two methodical"
"x83","travelers in a car, seeking to place themselves as comfortably as"
"x83","possible."
"x83",""
"x83","We might well ask ourselves of what materials are the hearts of these"

"x83",""
"x83","Three thick and solidly-made couches had been placed in the projectile."
"x83","Nicholl and Barbicane placed them in the center of the disc forming the"

"x83","During this time, Ardan, not being able to keep still, turned in his"

"x83","had given significant names."
"x83",""
"x83","“Ah, Diana! Ah, Satellite!” he exclaimed, teasing them; “so you are"
"x83","going to show the moon-dogs the good habits of the dogs of the earth!"

"x83","“Done, my captain!” replied Ardan, clasping Nicholl’s hand. “But, by"
"x83","the bye, you have already lost three bets with our president, as the"
"x83","necessary funds for the enterprise have been found, as the operation of"
"x83","casting has been successful, and lastly, as the Columbiad has been"
"x83","loaded without accident, six thousand dollars.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes,” replied Nicholl. “Thirty-seven minutes six seconds past ten.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“It is understood, captain. Well, before another quarter of an hour you"
"x83","will have to count nine thousand dollars to the president; four"

"x83","THE FIRST HALF-HOUR"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","What had happened? What effect had this frightful shock produced? Had"
"x83","the ingenuity of the constructors of the projectile obtained any happy"
"x83","result? Had the shock been deadened, thanks to the springs, the four"
"x83","plugs, the water-cushions, and the partition-breaks? Had they been able"
"x83","to subdue the frightful pressure of the initiatory speed of more than"
"x83","11,000 yards, which was enough to traverse Paris or New York in a"
"x83","second? This was evidently the question suggested to the thousand"
"x83","spectators of this moving scene. They forgot the aim of the journey,"
"x83","and thought only of the travelers. And if one of them—Joseph T. Maston"
"x83","for example—could have cast one glimpse into the projectile, what would"
"x83","he have seen?"
"x83",""
"x83","Nothing then. The darkness was profound. But its cylindro- conical"
"x83","partitions had resisted wonderfully. Not a rent or a dent anywhere! The"
"x83","wonderful projectile was not even heated under the intense deflagration"
"x83","of the powder, nor liquefied, as they seemed to fear, in a shower of"
"x83","aluminum."
"x83",""
"x83","The interior showed but little disorder; indeed, only a few objects had"

"x83","On the movable disc, sunk down to the bottom by the smashing of the"
"x83","partition-breaks and the escape of the water, three bodies lay"
"x83","apparently lifeless. Barbicane, Nicholl, and Michel Ardan—did they"
"x83","still breathe? or was the projectile nothing now but a metal coffin,"
"x83","bearing three corpses into space?"
"x83",""
"x83","Some minutes after the departure of the projectile, one of the bodies"
"x83","moved, shook its arms, lifted its head, and finally succeeded in"
"x83","getting on its knees. It was Michel Ardan. He felt himself all over,"
"x83","gave a sonorous “Hem!” and then said:"
"x83",""
"x83","“Michel Ardan is whole. How about the others?”"
"x83",""
"x83","The courageous Frenchman tried to rise, but could not stand. His head"
"x83","swam, from the rush of blood; he was blind; he was a drunken man."
"x83",""
"x83","“Bur-r!” said he. “It produces the same effect as two bottles of"
"x83","Corton, though perhaps less agreeable to swallow.” Then, passing his"
"x83","hand several times across his forehead and rubbing his temples, he"
"x83","called in a firm voice:"
"x83",""
"x83","“Nicholl! Barbicane!”"
"x83",""
"x83","He waited anxiously. No answer; not even a sigh to show that the hearts"
"x83","of his companions were still beating. He called again. The same"
"x83","silence."
"x83",""
"x83","“The devil!” he exclaimed. “They look as if they had fallen from a"
"x83","fifth story on their heads. Bah!” he added, with that imperturbable"
"x83","confidence which nothing could check, “if a Frenchman can get on his"
"x83","knees, two Americans ought to be able to get on their feet. But first"
"x83","let us light up.”"
"x83",""
"x83","Ardan felt the tide of life return by degrees. His blood became calm,"
"x83","and returned to its accustomed circulation. Another effort restored his"
"x83","equilibrium. He succeeded in rising, drew a match from his pocket, and"
"x83","approaching the burner lighted it. The receiver had not suffered at"
"x83","all. The gas had not escaped. Besides, the smell would have betrayed"
"x83","it; and in that case Michel Ardan could not have carried a lighted"
"x83","match with impunity through the space filled with hydrogen. The gas"
"x83","mixing with the air would have produced a detonating mixture, and the"
"x83","explosion would have finished what the shock had perhaps begun. When"
"x83","the burner was lit, Ardan leaned over the bodies of his companions:"
"x83","they were lying one on the other, an inert mass, Nicholl above,"
"x83","Barbicane underneath."
"x83",""
"x83","Ardan lifted the captain, propped him up against the divan, and began"
"x83","to rub vigorously. This means, used with judgment, restored Nicholl,"
"x83","who opened his eyes, and instantly recovering his presence of mind,"
"x83","seized Ardan’s hand and looked around him."
"x83",""
"x83","“And Barbicane?” said he."
"x83",""
"x83","“Each in turn,” replied Michel Ardan. “I began with you, Nicholl,"
"x83","because you were on the top. Now let us look to Barbicane.” Saying"
"x83","which, Ardan and Nicholl raised the president of the Gun Club and laid"
"x83","him on the divan. He seemed to have suffered more than either of his"
"x83","companions; he was bleeding, but Nicholl was reassured by finding that"
"x83","the hemorrhage came from a slight wound on the shoulder, a mere graze,"
"x83","which he bound up carefully."
"x83",""
"x83","Still, Barbicane was a long time coming to himself, which frightened"
"x83","his friends, who did not spare friction."
"x83",""
"x83","“He breathes though,” said Nicholl, putting his ear to the chest of the"
"x83","wounded man."
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes,” replied Ardan, “he breathes like a man who has some notion of"
"x83","that daily operation. Rub, Nicholl; let us rub harder.” And the two"
"x83","improvised practitioners worked so hard and so well that Barbicane"
"x83","recovered his senses. He opened his eyes, sat up, took his two friends"
"x83","by the hands, and his first words were—"
"x83",""
"x83","“Nicholl, are we moving?”"
"x83",""
"x83","Nicholl and Ardan looked at each other; they had not yet troubled"
"x83","themselves about the projectile; their first thought had been for the"
"x83","traveler, not for the car."
"x83",""
"x83","“Well, are we really moving?” repeated Michel Ardan."
"x83",""
"x83","“Or quietly resting on the soil of Florida?” asked Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","“Or at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico?” added Michel Ardan."
"x83",""
"x83","“What an idea!” exclaimed the president."
"x83",""
"x83","And this double hypothesis suggested by his companions had the effect"
"x83","of recalling him to his senses. In any case they could not decide on"
"x83","the position of the projectile. Its apparent immovability, and the want"
"x83","of communication with the outside, prevented them from solving the"
"x83","question. Perhaps the projectile was unwinding its course through"
"x83","space. Perhaps after a short rise it had fallen upon the earth, or even"
"x83","in the Gulf of Mexico—a fall which the narrowness of the peninsula of"
"x83","Florida would render not impossible."
"x83",""
"x83","The case was serious, the problem interesting, and one that must be"
"x83","solved as soon as possible. Thus, highly excited, Barbicane’s moral"
"x83","energy triumphed over physical weakness, and he rose to his feet. He"
"x83","listened. Outside was perfect silence; but the thick padding was enough"
"x83","to intercept all sounds coming from the earth. But one circumstance"
"x83","struck Barbicane, viz., that the temperature inside the projectile was"
"x83","singularly high. The president drew a thermometer from its case and"
"x83","consulted it. The instrument showed 81° Fahr."
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes,” he exclaimed, “yes, we are moving! This stifling heat,"
"x83","penetrating through the partitions of the projectile, is produced by"
"x83","its friction on the atmospheric strata. It will soon diminish, because"
"x83","we are already floating in space, and after having nearly stifled, we"
"x83","shall have to suffer intense cold."
"x83",""
"x83","“What!” said Michel Ardan. “According to your showing, Barbicane, we"
"x83","are already beyond the limits of the terrestrial atmosphere?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Without a doubt, Michel. Listen to me. It is fifty-five minutes past"
"x83","ten; we have been gone about eight minutes; and if our initiatory speed"
"x83","has not been checked by the friction, six seconds would be enough for"
"x83","us to pass through the forty miles of atmosphere which surrounds the"
"x83","globe.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Just so,” replied Nicholl; “but in what proportion do you estimate the"
"x83","diminution of speed by friction?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“In the proportion of one-third, Nicholl. This diminution is"
"x83","considerable, but according to my calculations it is nothing less. If,"
"x83","then, we had an initiatory speed of 12,000 yards, on leaving the"
"x83","atmosphere this speed would be reduced to 9,165 yards. In any case we"
"x83","have already passed through this interval, and—”"
"x83",""
"x83","“And then,” said Michel Ardan, “friend Nicholl has lost his two bets:"
"x83","four thousand dollars because the Columbiad did not burst; five"
"x83","thousand dollars because the projectile has risen more than six miles."
"x83","Now, Nicholl, pay up.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Let us prove it first,” said the captain, “and we will pay afterward."
"x83","It is quite possible that Barbicane’s reasoning is correct, and that I"
"x83","have lost my nine thousand dollars. But a new hypothesis presents"
"x83","itself to my mind, and it annuls the wager.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“What is that?” asked Barbicane quickly."
"x83",""
"x83","“The hypothesis that, for some reason or other, fire was never set to"
"x83","the powder, and we have not started at all.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“My goodness, captain,” exclaimed Michel Ardan, “that hypothesis is not"
"x83","worthy of my brain! It cannot be a serious one. For have we not been"
"x83","half annihilated by the shock? Did I not recall you to life? Is not the"
"x83","president’s shoulder still bleeding from the blow it has received?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Granted,” replied Nicholl; “but one question.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Well, captain?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Did you hear the detonation, which certainly ought to be loud?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“No,” replied Ardan, much surprised; “certainly I did not hear the"
"x83","detonation.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“And you, Barbicane?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Nor I, either.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Very well,” said Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","“Well now,” murmured the president “why did we not hear the"
"x83","detonation?”"
"x83",""
"x83","The three friends looked at each other with a disconcerted air. It was"
"x83","quite an inexplicable phenomenon. The projectile had started, and"
"x83","consequently there must have been a detonation."
"x83",""
"x83","“Let us first find out where we are,” said Barbicane, “and let down"
"x83","this panel.”"
"x83",""
"x83","This very simple operation was soon accomplished."
"x83",""
"x83","The nuts which held the bolts to the outer plates of the right-hand"
"x83","scuttle gave way under the pressure of the English wrench. These bolts"
"x83","were pushed outside, and the buffers covered with India-rubber stopped"
"x83","up the holes which let them through. Immediately the outer plate fell"
"x83","back upon its hinges like a porthole, and the lenticular glass which"
"x83","closed the scuttle appeared. A similar one was let into the thick"
"x83","partition on the opposite side of the projectile, another in the top of"
"x83","the dome, and finally a fourth in the middle of the base. They could,"
"x83","therefore, make observations in four different directions; the"
"x83","firmament by the side and most direct windows, the earth or the moon by"
"x83","the upper and under openings in the projectile."
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane and his two companions immediately rushed to the uncovered"
"x83","window. But it was lit by no ray of light. Profound darkness surrounded"
"x83","them, which, however, did not prevent the president from exclaiming:"
"x83",""
"x83","“No, my friends, we have not fallen back upon the earth; no, nor are we"
"x83","submerged in the Gulf of Mexico. Yes! we are mounting into space. See"
"x83","those stars shining in the night, and that impenetrable darkness heaped"
"x83","up between the earth and us!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Hurrah! hurrah!” exclaimed Michel Ardan and Nicholl in one voice."
"x83",""
"x83","Indeed, this thick darkness proved that the projectile had left the"
"x83","earth, for the soil, brilliantly lit by the moon-beams would have been"
"x83","visible to the travelers, if they had been lying on its surface. This"
"x83","darkness also showed that the projectile had passed the atmospheric"
"x83","strata, for the diffused light spread in the air would have been"
"x83","reflected on the metal walls, which reflection was wanting. This light"
"x83","would have lit the window, and the window was dark. Doubt was no longer"
"x83","possible; the travelers had left the earth."
"x83",""
"x83","“I have lost,” said Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","“I congratulate you,” replied Ardan."
"x83",""
"x83","“Here are the nine thousand dollars,” said the captain, drawing a roll"
"x83","of paper dollars from his pocket."
"x83",""
"x83","“Will you have a receipt for it?” asked Barbicane, taking the sum."
"x83",""
"x83","“If you do not mind,” answered Nicholl; “it is more business-like.”"
"x83",""
"x83","And coolly and seriously, as if he had been at his strong-box, the"
"x83","president drew forth his notebook, tore out a blank leaf, wrote a"
"x83","proper receipt in pencil, dated and signed it with the usual"
"x83","flourish,[1] and gave it to the captain, who carefully placed it in his"
"x83","pocketbook. Michel Ardan, taking off his hat, bowed to his two"
"x83","companions without speaking. So much formality under such circumstances"
"x83","left him speechless. He had never before seen anything so “American.”"
"x83",""
"x83"," [1] This is a purely French habit."
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","This affair settled, Barbicane and Nicholl had returned to the window,"
"x83","and were watching the constellations. The stars looked like bright"
"x83","points on the black sky. But from that side they could not see the orb"
"x83","of night, which, traveling from east to west, would rise by degrees"
"x83","toward the zenith. Its absence drew the following remark from Ardan:"
"x83",""
"x83","“And the moon; will she perchance fail at our rendezvous?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Do not alarm yourself,” said Barbicane; “our future globe is at its"
"x83","post, but we cannot see her from this side; let us open the other.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“As Barbicane was about leaving the window to open the opposite"
"x83","scuttle, his attention was attracted by the approach of a brilliant"
"x83","object. It was an enormous disc, whose colossal dimension could not be"
"x83","estimated. Its face, which was turned to the earth, was very bright."
"x83","One might have thought it a small moon reflecting the light of the"
"x83","large one. She advanced with great speed, and seemed to describe an"
"x83","orbit round the earth, which would intersect the passage of the"
"x83","projectile. This body revolved upon its axis, and exhibited the"
"x83","phenomena of all celestial bodies abandoned in space."
"x83",""
"x83","“Ah!” exclaimed Michel Ardan, “What is that? another projectile?”"
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane did not answer. The appearance of this enormous body"
"x83","surprised and troubled him. A collision was possible, and might be"
"x83","attended with deplorable results; either the projectile would deviate"
"x83","from its path, or a shock, breaking its impetus, might precipitate it"
"x83","to earth; or, lastly, it might be irresistibly drawn away by the"
"x83","powerful asteroid. The president caught at a glance the consequences of"
"x83","these three hypotheses, either of which would, one way or the other,"
"x83","bring their experiment to an unsuccessful and fatal termination. His"
"x83","companions stood silently looking into space. The object grew rapidly"
"x83","as it approached them, and by an optical illusion the projectile seemed"
"x83","to be throwing itself before it."
"x83",""
"x83","“By Jove!” exclaimed Michel Ardan, “we shall run into one another!”"
"x83",""
"x83","Instinctively the travelers drew back. Their dread was great, but it"
"x83","did not last many seconds. The asteroid passed several hundred yards"
"x83","from the projectile and disappeared, not so much from the rapidity of"
"x83","its course, as that its face being opposite the moon, it was suddenly"
"x83","merged into the perfect darkness of space."
"x83",""
"x83","“A happy journey to you,” exclaimed Michel Ardan, with a sigh of"
"x83","relief. “Surely infinity of space is large enough for a poor little"
"x83","projectile to walk through without fear. Now, what is this portentous"
"x83","globe which nearly struck us?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“I know,” replied Barbicane."
"x83",""
"x83","“Oh, indeed! you know everything.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“It is,” said Barbicane, “a simple meteorite, but an enormous one,"
"x83","which the attraction of the earth has retained as a satellite.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Is it possible!” exclaimed Michel Ardan; “the earth then has two moons"
"x83","like Neptune?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes, my friends, two moons, though it passes generally for having only"
"x83","one; but this second moon is so small, and its speed so great, that the"
"x83","inhabitants of the earth cannot see it. It was by noticing disturbances"
"x83","that a French astronomer, M. Petit, was able to determine the existence"
"x83","of this second satellite and calculate its elements. According to his"
"x83","observations, this meteorite will accomplish its revolution around the"
"x83","earth in three hours and twenty minutes, which implies a wonderful rate"
"x83","of speed.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Do all astronomers admit the existence of this satellite?” asked"
"x83","Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","“No,” replied Barbicane; “but if, like us, they had met it, they could"
"x83","no longer doubt it. Indeed, I think that this meteorite, which, had it"
"x83","struck the projectile, would have much embarrassed us, will give us the"
"x83","means of deciding what our position in space is.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“How?” said Ardan."
"x83",""
"x83","“Because its distance is known, and when we met it, we were exactly"
"x83","four thousand six hundred and fifty miles from the surface of the"
"x83","terrestrial globe.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“More than two thousand French leagues,” exclaimed Michel Ardan. “That"
"x83","beats the express trains of the pitiful globe called the earth.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“I should think so,” replied Nicholl, consulting his chronometer; “it"
"x83","is eleven o’clock, and it is only thirteen minutes since we left the"
"x83","American continent.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Only thirteen minutes?” said Barbicane."
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes,” said Nicholl; “and if our initiatory speed of twelve thousand"
"x83","yards has been kept up, we shall have made about twenty thousand miles"
"x83","in the hour.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“That is all very well, my friends,” said the president, “but the"
"x83","insoluble question still remains. Why did we not hear the detonation of"
"x83","the Columbiad?”"
"x83",""
"x83","For want of an answer the conversation dropped, and Barbicane began"
"x83","thoughtfully to let down the shutter of the second side. He succeeded;"
"x83","and through the uncovered glass the moon filled the projectile with a"
"x83","brilliant light. Nicholl, as an economical man, put out the gas, now"
"x83","useless, and whose brilliancy prevented any observation of the"
"x83","inter-planetary space."
"x83",""
"x83","The lunar disc shone with wonderful purity. Her rays, no longer"
"x83","filtered through the vapory atmosphere of the terrestrial globe, shone"
"x83","through the glass, filling the air in the interior of the projectile"
"x83","with silvery reflections. The black curtain of the firmament in reality"
"x83","heightened the moon’s brilliancy, which in this void of ether"
"x83","unfavorable to diffusion did not eclipse the neighboring stars. The"
"x83","heavens, thus seen, presented quite a new aspect, and one which the"
"x83","human eye could never dream of. One may conceive the interest with"
"x83","which these bold men watched the orb of night, the great aim of their"
"x83","journey."
"x83",""
"x83","In its motion the earth’s satellite was insensibly nearing the zenith,"
"x83","the mathematical point which it ought to attain ninety-six hours later."
"x83","Her mountains, her plains, every projection was as clearly discernible"
"x83","to their eyes as if they were observing it from some spot upon the"
"x83","earth; but its light was developed through space with wonderful"
"x83","intensity. The disc shone like a platinum mirror. Of the earth flying"
"x83","from under their feet, the travelers had lost all recollection."
"x83",""
"x83","It was captain Nicholl who first recalled their attention to the"
"x83","vanishing globe."
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes,” said Michel Ardan, “do not let us be ungrateful to it. Since we"
"x83","are leaving our country, let our last looks be directed to it. I wish"
"x83","to see the earth once more before it is quite hidden from my eyes.”"
"x83",""
"x83","To satisfy his companions, Barbicane began to uncover the window at the"
"x83","bottom of the projectile, which would allow them to observe the earth"
"x83","direct. The disc, which the force of the projection had beaten down to"
"x83","the base, was removed, not without difficulty. Its fragments, placed"
"x83","carefully against a wall, might serve again upon occasion. Then a"
"x83","circular gap appeared, nineteen inches in diameter, hollowed out of the"
"x83","lower part of the projectile. A glass cover, six inches thick and"
"x83","strengthened with upper fastenings, closed it tightly. Beneath was"
"x83","fixed an aluminum plate, held in place by bolts. The screws being"
"x83","undone, and the bolts let go, the plate fell down, and visible"
"x83","communication was established between the interior and the exterior."
"x83",""
"x83","Michel Ardan knelt by the glass. It was cloudy, seemingly opaque."
"x83",""
"x83","“Well!” he exclaimed, “and the earth?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“The earth?” said Barbicane. “There it is.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“What! that little thread; that silver crescent?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Doubtless, Michel. In four days, when the moon will be full, at the"
"x83","very time we shall reach it, the earth will be new, and will only"
"x83","appear to us as a slender crescent which will soon disappear, and for"
"x83","some days will be enveloped in utter darkness.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“That the earth?” repeated Michel Ardan, looking with all his eyes at"
"x83","the thin slip of his native planet."
"x83",""
"x83","The explanation given by President Barbicane was correct. The earth,"
"x83","with respect to the projectile, was entering its last phase. It was in"
"x83","its octant, and showed a crescent finely traced on the dark background"
"x83","of the sky. Its light, rendered bluish by the thick strata of the"
"x83","atmosphere was less intense than that of the crescent moon, but it was"
"x83","of considerable dimensions, and looked like an enormous arch stretched"
"x83","across the firmament. Some parts brilliantly lighted, especially on its"
"x83","concave part, showed the presence of high mountains, often disappearing"
"x83","behind thick spots, which are never seen on the lunar disc. They were"
"x83","rings of clouds placed concentrically round the terrestrial globe."
"x83",""
"x83","While the travelers were trying to pierce the profound darkness, a"
"x83","brilliant cluster of shooting stars burst upon their eyes. Hundreds of"
"x83","meteorites, ignited by the friction of the atmosphere, irradiated the"
"x83","shadow of the luminous train, and lined the cloudy parts of the disc"
"x83","with their fire. At this period the earth was in its perihelion, and"
"x83","the month of December is so propitious to these shooting stars, that"
"x83","astronomers have counted as many as twenty-four thousand in an hour."
"x83","But Michel Ardan, disdaining scientific reasonings, preferred thinking"
"x83","that the earth was thus saluting the departure of her three children"
"x83","with her most brilliant fireworks."
"x83",""
"x83","Indeed this was all they saw of the globe lost in the solar world,"
"x83","rising and setting to the great planets like a simple morning or"
"x83","evening star! This globe, where they had left all their affections, was"
"x83","nothing more than a fugitive crescent!"
"x83",""
"x83","Long did the three friends look without speaking, though united in"
"x83","heart, while the projectile sped onward with an ever-decreasing speed."
"x83","Then an irresistible drowsiness crept over their brain. Was it"
"x83","weariness of body and mind? No doubt; for after the over-excitement of"
"x83","those last hours passed upon earth, reaction was inevitable."
"x83",""
"x83","“Well,” said Nicholl, “since we must sleep, let us sleep.”"
"x83",""
"x83","And stretching themselves on their couches, they were all three soon in"
"x83","a profound slumber."
"x83",""
"x83","But they had not forgotten themselves more than a quarter of an hour,"
"x83","when Barbicane sat up suddenly, and rousing his companions with a loud"
"x83","voice, exclaimed—"
"x83",""
"x83","“I have found it!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“What have you found?” asked Michel Ardan, jumping from his bed."
"x83",""
"x83","“The reason why we did not hear the detonation of the Columbiad.”"

"x83","CHAPTER III."
"x83","THEIR PLACE OF SHELTER"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","This curious but certainly correct explanation once given, the three"
"x83","friends returned to their slumbers. Could they have found a calmer or"
"x83","more peaceful spot to sleep in? On the earth, houses, towns, cottages,"
"x83","and country feel every shock given to the exterior of the globe. On"
"x83","sea, the vessels rocked by the waves are still in motion; in the air,"
"x83","the balloon oscillates incessantly on the fluid strata of divers"
"x83","densities. This projectile alone, floating in perfect space, in the"
"x83","midst of perfect silence, offered perfect repose."
"x83",""
"x83","Thus the sleep of our adventurous travelers might have been"
"x83","indefinitely prolonged, if an unexpected noise had not awakened them at"
"x83","about seven o’clock in the morning of the 2nd of December, eight hours"
"x83","after their departure."
"x83",""
"x83","This noise was a very natural barking."

"x83","They looked and found one of the animals crouched under the divan."
"x83","Terrified and shaken by the initiatory shock, it had remained in the"
"x83","corner till its voice returned with the pangs of hunger. It was the"
"x83","amiable Diana, still very confused, who crept out of her retreat,"
"x83","though not without much persuasion, Michel Ardan encouraging her with"
"x83","most gracious words."
"x83",""
"x83","“Come, Diana,” said he: “come, my girl! thou whose destiny will be"
"x83","marked in the cynegetic annals; thou whom the pagans would have given"
"x83","as companion to the god Anubis, and Christians as friend to St. Roch;"
"x83","thou who art rushing into interplanetary space, and wilt perhaps be the"
"x83","Eve of all Selenite dogs! come, Diana, come here.”"
"x83",""
"x83","Diana, flattered or not, advanced by degrees, uttering plaintive cries."
"x83",""
"x83","“Good,” said Barbicane: “I see Eve, but where is Adam?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Adam?” replied Michel; “Adam cannot be far off; he is there somewhere;"
"x83","we must call him. Satellite! here, Satellite!”"
"x83",""
"x83","But Satellite did not appear. Diana would not leave off howling. They"
"x83","found, however, that she was not bruised, and they gave her a pie,"
"x83","which silenced her complaints. As to Satellite, he seemed quite lost."
"x83","They had to hunt a long time before finding him in one of the upper"
"x83","compartments of the projectile, whither some unaccountable shock must"
"x83","have violently hurled him. The poor beast, much hurt, was in a piteous"
"x83","state."
"x83",""
"x83","“The devil!” said Michel."
"x83",""
"x83","They brought the unfortunate dog down with great care. Its skull had"
"x83","been broken against the roof, and it seemed unlikely that he could"
"x83","recover from such a shock. Meanwhile, he was stretched comfortably on a"
"x83","cushion. Once there, he heaved a sigh."
"x83",""
"x83","“We will take care of you,” said Michel; “we are responsible for your"
"x83","existence. I would rather lose an arm than a paw of my poor Satellite.”"
"x83",""
"x83","Saying which, he offered some water to the wounded dog, who swallowed"
"x83","it with avidity."
"x83",""
"x83","This attention paid, the travelers watched the earth and the moon"
"x83","attentively. The earth was now only discernible by a cloudy disc ending"
"x83","in a crescent, rather more contracted than that of the previous"
"x83","evening; but its expanse was still enormous, compared with that of the"
"x83","moon, which was approaching nearer and nearer to a perfect circle."
"x83",""
"x83","“By Jove!” said Michel Ardan, “I am really sorry that we did not start"
"x83","when the earth was full, that is to say, when our globe was in"
"x83","opposition to the sun.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Why?” said Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","“Because we should have seen our continents and seas in a new light—the"
"x83","first resplendent under the solar rays, the latter cloudy as"
"x83","represented on some maps of the world. I should like to have seen those"
"x83","poles of the earth on which the eye of man has never yet rested.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“I dare say,” replied Barbicane; “but if the earth had been _full_, the"
"x83","moon would have been _new_; that is to say, invisible, because of the"
"x83","rays of the sun. It is better for us to see the destination we wish to"
"x83","reach, than the point of departure.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“You are right, Barbicane,” replied Captain Nicholl; “and, besides,"
"x83","when we have reached the moon, we shall have time during the long lunar"
"x83","nights to consider at our leisure the globe on which our likenesses"
"x83","swarm.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Our likenesses!” exclaimed Michel Ardan; “They are no more our"
"x83","likenesses than the Selenites are! We inhabit a new world, peopled by"
"x83","ourselves—the projectile! I am Barbicane’s likeness, and Barbicane is"
"x83","Nicholl’s. Beyond us, around us, human nature is at an end, and we are"
"x83","the only population of this microcosm until we become pure Selenites.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“In about eighty-eight hours,” replied the captain."
"x83",""
"x83","“Which means to say?” asked Michel Ardan."
"x83",""
"x83","“That it is half-past eight,” replied Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","“Very well,” retorted Michel; “then it is impossible for me to find"
"x83","even the shadow of a reason why we should not go to breakfast.”"
"x83",""
"x83","Indeed the inhabitants of the new star could not live without eating,"
"x83","and their stomachs were suffering from the imperious laws of hunger."
"x83","Michel Ardan, as a Frenchman, was declared chief cook, an important"
"x83","function, which raised no rival. The gas gave sufficient heat for the"
"x83","culinary apparatus, and the provision box furnished the elements of"
"x83","this first feast."
"x83",""
"x83","The breakfast began with three bowls of excellent soup, thanks to the"
"x83","liquefaction in hot water of those precious cakes of Liebig, prepared"
"x83","from the best parts of the ruminants of the Pampas. To the soup"
"x83","succeeded some beefsteaks, compressed by an hydraulic press, as tender"
"x83","and succulent as if brought straight from the kitchen of an English"
"x83","eating-house. Michel, who was imaginative, maintained that they were"
"x83","even “red.”"
"x83",""
"x83","Preserved vegetables (“fresher than nature,” said the amiable Michel)"
"x83","succeeded the dish of meat; and was followed by some cups of tea with"
"x83","bread and butter, after the American fashion."
"x83",""
"x83","The beverage was declared exquisite, and was due to the infusion of the"
"x83","choicest leaves, of which the emperor of Russia had given some chests"
"x83","for the benefit of the travelers."
"x83",""
"x83","And lastly, to crown the repast, Ardan had brought out a fine bottle of"
"x83","Nuits, which was found “by chance” in the provision-box. The three"
"x83","friends drank to the union of the earth and her satellite."
"x83",""
"x83","And, as if he had not already done enough for the generous wine which"
"x83","he had distilled on the slopes of Burgundy, the sun chose to be part of"
"x83","the party. At this moment the projectile emerged from the conical"
"x83","shadow cast by the terrestrial globe, and the rays of the radiant orb"
"x83","struck the lower disc of the projectile direct occasioned by the angle"
"x83","which the moon’s orbit makes with that of the earth."
"x83",""
"x83","“The sun!” exclaimed Michel Ardan."
"x83",""
"x83","“No doubt,” replied Barbicane; “I expected it.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“But,” said Michel, “the conical shadow which the earth leaves in space"
"x83","extends beyond the moon?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Far beyond it, if the atmospheric refraction is not taken into"
"x83","consideration,” said Barbicane. “But when the moon is enveloped in this"
"x83","shadow, it is because the centers of the three stars, the sun, the"
"x83","earth, and the moon, are all in one and the same straight line. Then"
"x83","the _nodes_ coincide with the _phases_ of the moon, and there is an"
"x83","eclipse. If we had started when there was an eclipse of the moon, all"
"x83","our passage would have been in the shadow, which would have been a"
"x83","pity.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Why?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Because, though we are floating in space, our projectile, bathed in"
"x83","the solar rays, will receive light and heat. It economizes the gas,"
"x83","which is in every respect a good economy.”"
"x83",""
"x83","Indeed, under these rays which no atmosphere can temper, either in"
"x83","temperature or brilliancy, the projectile grew warm and bright, as if"
"x83","it had passed suddenly from winter to summer. The moon above, the sun"
"x83","beneath, were inundating it with their fire."
"x83",""
"x83","“It is pleasant here,” said Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","“I should think so,” said Michel Ardan. “With a little earth spread on"
"x83","our aluminum planet we should have green peas in twenty-four hours. I"
"x83","have but one fear, which is that the walls of the projectile might"
"x83","melt.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Calm yourself, my worthy friend,” replied Barbicane; “the projectile"
"x83","withstood a very much higher temperature than this as it slid through"
"x83","the strata of the atmosphere. I should not be surprised if it did not"
"x83","look like a meteor on fire to the eyes of the spectators in Florida.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“But then J. T. Maston will think we are roasted!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“What astonishes me,” said Barbicane, “is that we have not been. That"
"x83","was a danger we had not provided for.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“I feared it,” said Nicholl simply."
"x83",""
"x83","“And you never mentioned it, my sublime captain,” exclaimed Michel"
"x83","Ardan, clasping his friend’s hand."
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane now began to settle himself in the projectile as if he was"
"x83","never to leave it. One must remember that this aerial car had a base"
"x83","with a _superficies_ of fifty-four square feet. Its height to the roof"
"x83","was twelve feet. Carefully laid out in the inside, and little"
"x83","encumbered by instruments and traveling utensils, which each had their"
"x83","particular place, it left the three travelers a certain freedom of"
"x83","movement. The thick window inserted in the bottom could bear any amount"
"x83","of weight, and Barbicane and his companions walked upon it as if it"
"x83","were solid plank; but the sun striking it directly with its rays lit"
"x83","the interior of the projectile from beneath, thus producing singular"
"x83","effects of light."
"x83",""
"x83","They began by investigating the state of their store of water and"
"x83","provisions, neither of which had suffered, thanks to the care taken to"
"x83","deaden the shock. Their provisions were abundant, and plentiful enough"
"x83","to last the three travelers for more than a year. Barbicane wished to"
"x83","be cautious, in case the projectile should land on a part of the moon"
"x83","which was utterly barren. As to water and the reserve of brandy, which"
"x83","consisted of fifty gallons, there was only enough for two months; but"
"x83","according to the last observations of astronomers, the moon had a low,"
"x83","dense, and thick atmosphere, at least in the deep valleys, and there"
"x83","springs and streams could not fail. Thus, during their passage, and for"
"x83","the first year of their settlement on the lunar continent, these"
"x83","adventurous explorers would suffer neither hunger nor thirst."
"x83",""
"x83","Now about the air in the projectile. There, too, they were secure."
"x83","Reiset and Regnaut’s apparatus, intended for the production of oxygen,"
"x83","was supplied with chlorate of potassium for two months. They"
"x83","necessarily consumed a certain quantity of gas, for they were obliged"
"x83","to keep the producing substance at a temperature of above 400°. But"
"x83","there again they were all safe. The apparatus only wanted a little"
"x83","care. But it was not enough to renew the oxygen; they must absorb the"
"x83","carbonic acid produced by expiration. During the last twelve hours the"
"x83","atmosphere of the projectile had become charged with this deleterious"
"x83","gas. Nicholl discovered the state of the air by observing Diana panting"
"x83","painfully. The carbonic acid, by a phenomenon similar to that produced"
"x83","in the famous Grotto del Cane, had collected at the bottom of the"
"x83","projectile owing to its weight. Poor Diana, with her head low, would"
"x83","suffer before her masters from the presence of this gas. But Captain"
"x83","Nicholl hastened to remedy this state of things, by placing on the"
"x83","floor several receivers containing caustic potash, which he shook about"
"x83","for a time, and this substance, greedy of carbonic acid, soon"
"x83","completely absorbed it, thus purifying the air."
"x83",""
"x83","An inventory of instruments was then begun. The thermometers and"
"x83","barometers had resisted, all but one minimum thermometer, the glass of"
"x83","which was broken. An excellent aneroid was drawn from the wadded box"
"x83","which contained it and hung on the wall. Of course it was only affected"
"x83","by and marked the pressure of the air inside the projectile, but it"
"x83","also showed the quantity of moisture which it contained. At that moment"
"x83","its needle oscillated between 25.24 and 25.08."
"x83",""
"x83","It was fine weather."
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane had also brought several compasses, which he found intact."
"x83","One must understand that under present conditions their needles were"
"x83","acting _wildly_, that is without any _constant_ direction. Indeed, at"
"x83","the distance they were from the earth, the magnetic pole could have no"
"x83","perceptible action upon the apparatus; but the box placed on the lunar"
"x83","disc might perhaps exhibit some strange phenomena. In any case it would"
"x83","be interesting to see whether the earth’s satellite submitted like"
"x83","herself to its magnetic influence."
"x83",""
"x83","A hypsometer to measure the height of the lunar mountains, a sextant to"
"x83","take the height of the sun, glasses which would be useful as they"
"x83","neared the moon, all these instruments were carefully looked over, and"
"x83","pronounced good in spite of the violent shock."
"x83",""
"x83","As to the pickaxes and different tools which were Nicholl’s especial"
"x83","choice; as to the sacks of different kinds of grain and shrubs which"
"x83","Michel Ardan hoped to transplant into Selenite ground, they were stowed"
"x83","away in the upper part of the projectile. There was a sort of granary"
"x83","there, loaded with things which the extravagant Frenchman had heaped"
"x83","up. What they were no one knew, and the good-tempered fellow did not"
"x83","explain. Now and then he climbed up by cramp-irons riveted to the"
"x83","walls, but kept the inspection to himself. He arranged and rearranged,"
"x83","he plunged his hand rapidly into certain mysterious boxes, singing in"
"x83","one of the falsest of voices an old French refrain to enliven the"
"x83","situation."
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane observed with some interest that his guns and other arms had"
"x83","not been damaged. These were important, because, heavily loaded, they"
"x83","were to help lessen the fall of the projectile, when drawn by the lunar"
"x83","attraction (after having passed the point of neutral attraction) on to"
"x83","the moon’s surface; a fall which ought to be six times less rapid than"
"x83","it would have been on the earth’s surface, thanks to the difference of"
"x83","bulk. The inspection ended with general satisfaction, when each"
"x83","returned to watch space through the side windows and the lower glass"
"x83","coverlid."
"x83",""
"x83","There was the same view. The whole extent of the celestial sphere"
"x83","swarmed with stars and constellations of wonderful purity, enough to"
"x83","drive an astronomer out of his mind! On one side the sun, like the"
"x83","mouth of a lighted oven, a dazzling disc without a halo, standing out"
"x83","on the dark background of the sky! On the other, the moon returning its"
"x83","fire by reflection, and apparently motionless in the midst of the"
"x83","starry world. Then, a large spot seemingly nailed to the firmament,"
"x83","bordered by a silvery cord; it was the earth! Here and there nebulous"
"x83","masses like large flakes of starry snow; and from the zenith to the"
"x83","nadir, an immense ring formed by an impalpable dust of stars, the"
"x83","“Milky Way,” in the midst of which the sun ranks only as a star of the"
"x83","fourth magnitude. The observers could not take their eyes from this"
"x83","novel spectacle, of which no description could give an adequate idea."
"x83","What reflections it suggested! What emotions hitherto unknown awoke in"
"x83","their souls! Barbicane wished to begin the relation of his journey"
"x83","while under its first impressions, and hour after hour took notes of"
"x83","all facts happening in the beginning of the enterprise. He wrote"
"x83","quietly, with his large square writing, in a business-like style."
"x83",""
"x83","During this time Nicholl, the calculator, looked over the minutes of"
"x83","their passage, and worked out figures with unparalleled dexterity."
"x83","Michel Ardan chatted first with Barbicane, who did not answer him, and"
"x83","then with Nicholl, who did not hear him, with Diana, who understood"
"x83","none of his theories, and lastly with himself, questioning and"
"x83","answering, going and coming, busy with a thousand details; at one time"
"x83","bent over the lower glass, at another roosting in the heights of the"
"x83","projectile, and always singing. In this microcosm he represented French"
"x83","loquacity and excitability, and we beg you to believe that they were"
"x83","well represented. The day, or rather (for the expression is not"
"x83","correct) the lapse of twelve hours, which forms a day upon the earth,"
"x83","closed with a plentiful supper carefully prepared. No accident of any"
"x83","nature had yet happened to shake the travelers’ confidence; so, full of"
"x83","hope, already sure of success, they slept peacefully, while the"
"x83","projectile under an uniformly decreasing speed was crossing the sky."

"x83","A LITTLE ALGEBRA"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","The night passed without incident. The word “night,” however, is"
"x83","scarcely applicable."
"x83",""
"x83","The position of the projectile with regard to the sun did not change."
"x83","Astronomically, it was daylight on the lower part, and night on the"
"x83","upper; so when during this narrative these words are used, they"
"x83","represent the lapse of time between rising and setting of the sun upon"
"x83","the earth."
"x83",""
"x83","The travelers’ sleep was rendered more peaceful by the projectile’s"
"x83","excessive speed, for it seemed absolutely motionless. Not a motion"
"x83","betrayed its onward course through space. The rate of progress, however"
"x83","rapid it might be, cannot produce any sensible effect on the human"
"x83","frame when it takes place in a vacuum, or when the mass of air"
"x83","circulates with the body which is carried with it. What inhabitant of"
"x83","the earth perceives its speed, which, however, is at the rate of 68,000"
"x83","miles per hour? Motion under such conditions is “felt” no more than"
"x83","repose; and when a body is in repose it will remain so as long as no"
"x83","strange force displaces it; if moving, it will not stop unless an"
"x83","obstacle comes in its way. This indifference to motion or repose is"
"x83","called inertia."
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane and his companions might have believed themselves perfectly"
"x83","stationary, being shut up in the projectile; indeed, the effect would"
"x83","have been the same if they had been on the outside of it. Had it not"
"x83","been for the moon, which was increasing above them, they might have"
"x83","sworn that they were floating in complete stagnation."
"x83",""
"x83","That morning, the 3rd of December, the travelers were awakened by a"
"x83","joyous but unexpected noise; it was the crowing of a cock which sounded"
"x83","through the car. Michel Ardan, who was the first on his feet, climbed"
"x83","to the top of the projectile, and shutting a box, the lid of which was"
"x83","partly open, said in a low voice, “Will you hold your tongue? That"

"x83","But Nicholl and Barbicane were awake."

"x83","“Barbicane, do you know what I have been thinking of all night?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“No,” answered the president."
"x83",""
"x83","“Of our Cambridge friends. You have already remarked that I am an"
"x83","ignoramus in mathematical subjects; and it is impossible for me to find"
"x83","out how the savants of the observatory were able to calculate what"

"x83","in order to attain the moon.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“You mean to say,” replied Barbicane, “to attain that neutral point"
"x83","where the terrestrial and lunar attractions are equal; for, starting"
"x83","from that point, situated about nine-tenths of the distance traveled"
"x83","over, the projectile would simply fall upon the moon, on account of its"
"x83","weight.”"
"x83",""

"x83","“No, Michel; the difficult part is what Barbicane has done; that is, to"

"x83","The remainder is only a question of arithmetic, requiring merely the"

"x83",""
"x83","“That is something!” replied Michel Ardan, who for his life could not"

"x83","allowed one to obtain all sorts of totals."
"x83",""
"x83","“The expression _v_ zero, which you see in that equation, is the speed"

"x83","“Just so,” said Nicholl; “it is from that point that we must calculate"
"x83","the velocity, since we know already that the velocity at departure was"
"x83","exactly one and a half times more than on leaving the atmosphere.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“I understand no more,” said Michel."
"x83",""
"x83","“It is a very simple calculation,” said Barbicane."
"x83",""
"x83","“Not as simple as I am,” retorted Michel."
"x83",""
"x83","“That means, that when our projectile reached the limits of the"

"x83","speed.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“As much as that?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes, my friend; merely by friction against the atmospheric strata. You"
"x83","understand that the faster it goes the more resistance it meets with"
"x83","from the air.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“That I admit,” answered Michel; “and I understand it, although your"
"x83","x’s and zero’s, and algebraic formula, are rattling in my head like"
"x83","nails in a bag.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“First effects of algebra,” replied Barbicane; “and now, to finish, we"

"x83","“Finish me!” replied Michel."

"x83","Barbicane took the paper, and began to make his calculations with great"

"x83","THE COLD OF SPACE"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","This revelation came like a thunderbolt. Who could have expected such"
"x83","an error in calculation? Barbicane would not believe it. Nicholl"
"x83","revised his figures: they were exact. As to the formula which had"
"x83","determined them, they could not suspect its truth; it was evident that"
"x83","an initiatory velocity of seventeen thousand yards in the first second"
"x83","was necessary to enable them to reach the neutral point."
"x83",""
"x83","The three friends looked at each other silently. There was no thought"
"x83","of breakfast. Barbicane, with clenched teeth, knitted brows, and hands"
"x83","clasped convulsively, was watching through the window. Nicholl had"
"x83","crossed his arms, and was examining his calculations. Michel Ardan was"
"x83","muttering:"
"x83",""
"x83","“That is just like these scientific men: they never do anything else. I"
"x83","would give twenty pistoles if we could fall upon the Cambridge"
"x83","Observatory and crush it, together with the whole lot of dabblers in"
"x83","figures which it contains.”"
"x83",""
"x83","Suddenly a thought struck the captain, which he at once communicated to"
"x83","Barbicane."
"x83",""
"x83","“Ah!” said he; “it is seven o’clock in the morning; we have already"
"x83","been gone thirty-two hours; more than half our passage is over, and we"
"x83","are not falling that I am aware of.”"
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane did not answer, but after a rapid glance at the captain, took"
"x83","a pair of compasses wherewith to measure the angular distance of the"
"x83","terrestrial globe; then from the lower window he took an exact"
"x83","observation, and noticed that the projectile was apparently stationary."
"x83","Then rising and wiping his forehead, on which large drops of"
"x83","perspiration were standing, he put some figures on paper. Nicholl"
"x83","understood that the president was deducting from the terrestrial"
"x83","diameter the projectile’s distance from the earth. He watched him"
"x83","anxiously."
"x83",""
"x83","“No,” exclaimed Barbicane, after some moments, “no, we are not falling!"
"x83","no, we are already more than 50,000 leagues from the earth. We have"
"x83","passed the point at which the projectile would have stopped if its"
"x83","speed had only been 12,000 yards at starting. We are still going up.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“That is evident,” replied Nicholl; “and we must conclude that our"
"x83","initial speed, under the power of the 400,000 pounds of gun-cotton,"
"x83","must have exceeded the required 12,000 yards. Now I can understand how,"
"x83","after thirteen minutes only, we met the second satellite, which"
"x83","gravitates round the earth at more than 2,000 leagues’ distance.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“And this explanation is the more probable,” added Barbicane, “Because,"
"x83","in throwing off the water enclosed between its partition-breaks, the"
"x83","projectile found itself lightened of a considerable weight.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Just so,” said Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","“Ah, my brave Nicholl, we are saved!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Very well then,” said Michel Ardan quietly; “as we are safe, let us"
"x83","have breakfast.”"
"x83",""
"x83","Nicholl was not mistaken. The initial speed had been, very fortunately,"
"x83","much above that estimated by the Cambridge Observatory; but the"
"x83","Cambridge Observatory had nevertheless made a mistake."
"x83",""
"x83","The travelers, recovered from this false alarm, breakfasted merrily. If"
"x83","they ate a good deal, they talked more. Their confidence was greater"
"x83","after than before “the incident of the algebra.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Why should we not succeed?” said Michel Ardan; “why should we not"
"x83","arrive safely? We are launched; we have no obstacle before us, no"
"x83","stones in the way; the road is open, more so than that of a ship"
"x83","battling with the sea; more open than that of a balloon battling with"
"x83","the wind; and if a ship can reach its destination, a balloon go where"
"x83","it pleases, why cannot our projectile attain its end and aim?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“It _will_ attain it,” said Barbicane."
"x83",""
"x83","“If only to do honor to the Americans,” added Michel Ardan, “the only"
"x83","people who could bring such an enterprise to a happy termination, and"
"x83","the only one which could produce a President Barbicane. Ah, now we are"
"x83","no longer uneasy, I begin to think, What will become of us? We shall"
"x83","get right royally weary.”"
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane and Nicholl made a gesture of denial."
"x83",""
"x83","“But I have provided for the contingency, my friends,” replied Michel;"
"x83","“you have only to speak, and I have chess, draughts, cards, and"
"x83","dominoes at your disposal; nothing is wanting but a billiard-table.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“What!” exclaimed Barbicane; “you brought away such trifles?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Certainly,” replied Michel, “and not only to distract ourselves, but"
"x83","also with the laudable intention of endowing the Selenite smoking"
"x83","divans with them.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“My friend,” said Barbicane, “if the moon is inhabited, its inhabitants"
"x83","must have appeared some thousands of years before those of the earth,"
"x83","for we cannot doubt that their star is much older than ours. If then"
"x83","these Selenites have existed their hundreds of thousands of years, and"
"x83","if their brain is of the same organization of the human brain, they"
"x83","have already invented all that we have invented, and even what we may"
"x83","invent in future ages. They have nothing to learn from _us_, and we"
"x83","have everything to learn from _them_.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“What!” said Michel; “you believe that they have artists like Phidias,"
"x83","Michael Angelo, or Raphael?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Poets like Homer, Virgil, Milton, Lamartine, and Hugo?”"

"x83","“I could swear it.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Comic writers like Arnal, and photographers like—like Nadar?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Certain.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Then, friend Barbicane, if they are as strong as we are, and even"
"x83","stronger—these Selenites—why have they not tried to communicate with"
"x83","the earth? why have they not launched a lunar projectile to our"
"x83","terrestrial regions?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Who told you that they have never done so?” said Barbicane seriously."
"x83",""
"x83","“Indeed,” added Nicholl, “it would be easier for them than for us, for"
"x83","two reasons; first, because the attraction on the moon’s surface is six"
"x83","times less than on that of the earth, which would allow a projectile to"
"x83","rise more easily; secondly, because it would be enough to send such a"
"x83","projectile only at 8,000 leagues instead of 80,000, which would require"
"x83","the force of projection to be ten times less strong.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Then,” continued Michel, “I repeat it, why have they not done it?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“And I repeat,” said Barbicane; “who told you that they have not done"
"x83","it?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“When?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Thousands of years before man appeared on earth.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“And the projectile—where is the projectile? I demand to see the"
"x83","projectile.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“My friend,” replied Barbicane, “the sea covers five-sixths of our"
"x83","globe. From that we may draw five good reasons for supposing that the"
"x83","lunar projectile, if ever launched, is now at the bottom of the"
"x83","Atlantic or the Pacific, unless it sped into some crevasse at that"
"x83","period when the crust of the earth was not yet hardened.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Old Barbicane,” said Michel, “you have an answer for everything, and I"
"x83","bow before your wisdom. But there is one hypothesis that would suit me"
"x83","better than all the others, which is, the Selenites, being older than"
"x83","we, are wiser, and have not invented gunpowder.”"

"x83","“Why?” asked Michel."

"x83","“But we manufacture the air?”"

"x83","“Only in part. We make only the oxygen, my worthy Michel; and with"
"x83","regard to that, we must watch that the apparatus does not furnish the"
"x83","oxygen in too great a quantity; for an excess would bring us very"
"x83","serious physiological troubles. But if we make the oxygen, we do not"
"x83","make the azote, that medium which the lungs do not absorb, and which"
"x83","ought to remain intact; and that azote will escape rapidly through the"
"x83","open scuttles.”"

"x83","“Oh! the time for throwing out poor Satellite?” said Michel."
"x83",""
"x83","“Agreed; but we must act quickly.”"

"x83","“And the second reason?” asked Michel."
"x83",""
"x83","“The second reason is that we must not let the outer cold, which is"
"x83","excessive, penetrate the projectile or we shall be frozen to death.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“But the sun?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“The sun warms our projectile, which absorbs its rays; but it does not"
"x83","warm the vacuum in which we are floating at this moment. Where there is"
"x83","no air, there is no more heat than diffused light; and the same with"
"x83","darkness; it is cold where the sun’s rays do not strike direct. This"
"x83","temperature is only the temperature produced by the radiation of the"
"x83","stars; that is to say, what the terrestrial globe would undergo if the"
"x83","sun disappeared one day.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Which is not to be feared,” replied Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","“Who knows?” said Michel Ardan. “But, in admitting that the sun does"
"x83","not go out, might it not happen that the earth might move away from"
"x83","it?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“There!” said Barbicane, “there is Michel with his ideas.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“And,” continued Michel, “do we not know that in 1861 the earth passed"
"x83","through the tail of a comet? Or let us suppose a comet whose power of"
"x83","attraction is greater than that of the sun. The terrestrial orbit will"
"x83","bend toward the wandering star, and the earth, becoming its satellite,"
"x83","will be drawn such a distance that the rays of the sun will have no"
"x83","action on its surface.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“That _might_ happen, indeed,” replied Barbicane, “but the consequences"
"x83","of such a displacement need not be so formidable as you suppose.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“And why not?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Because the heat and cold would be equalized on our globe. It has been"
"x83","calculated that, had our earth been carried along in its course by the"
"x83","comet of 1861, at its perihelion, that is, its nearest approach to the"
"x83","sun, it would have undergone a heat 28,000 times greater than that of"
"x83","summer. But this heat, which is sufficient to evaporate the waters,"
"x83","would have formed a thick ring of cloud, which would have modified that"
"x83","excessive temperature; hence the compensation between the cold of the"
"x83","aphelion and the heat of the perihelion.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“At how many degrees,” asked Nicholl, “is the temperature of the"
"x83","planetary spaces estimated?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Formerly,” replied Barbicane, “it was greatly exagerated; but now,"
"x83","after the calculations of Fourier, of the French Academy of Science, it"
"x83","is not supposed to exceed 60° Centigrade below zero.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Pooh!” said Michel, “that’s nothing!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“It is very much,” replied Barbicane; “the temperature which was"
"x83","observed in the polar regions, at Melville Island and Fort Reliance,"
"x83","that is 76° Fahrenheit below zero.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“If I mistake not,” said Nicholl, “M. Pouillet, another savant,"
"x83","estimates the temperature of space at 250° Fahrenheit below zero. We"
"x83","shall, however, be able to verify these calculations for ourselves.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Not at present; because the solar rays, beating directly upon our"
"x83","thermometer, would give, on the contrary, a very high temperature. But,"
"x83","when we arrive in the moon, during its fifteen days of night at either"
"x83","face, we shall have leisure to make the experiment, for our satellite"
"x83","lies in a vacuum.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“What do you mean by a vacuum?” asked Michel. “Is it perfectly such?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“It is absolutely void of air.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“And is the air replaced by nothing whatever?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“By the ether only,” replied Barbicane."
"x83",""
"x83","“And pray what is the ether?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“The ether, my friend, is an agglomeration of imponderable atoms,"
"x83","which, relatively to their dimensions, are as far removed from each"
"x83","other as the celestial bodies are in space. It is these atoms which, by"
"x83","their vibratory motion, produce both light and heat in the universe.”"
"x83",""
"x83","They now proceeded to the burial of Satellite. They had merely to drop"
"x83","him into space, in the same way that sailors drop a body into the sea;"
"x83","but, as President Barbicane suggested, they must act quickly, so as to"
"x83","lose as little as possible of that air whose elasticity would rapidly"
"x83","have spread it into space. The bolts of the right scuttle, the opening"
"x83","of which measured about twelve inches across, were carefully drawn,"
"x83","while Michel, quite grieved, prepared to launch his dog into space. The"
"x83","glass, raised by a powerful lever, which enabled it to overcome the"
"x83","pressure of the inside air on the walls of the projectile, turned"
"x83","rapidly on its hinges, and Satellite was thrown out. Scarcely a"
"x83","particle of air could have escaped, and the operation was so successful"

"x83","QUESTION AND ANSWER"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","On the 4th of December, when the travelers awoke after fifty-four"
"x83","hours’ journey, the chronometer marked five o’clock of the terrestrial"
"x83","morning. In time it was just over five hours and forty minutes, half of"
"x83","that assigned to their sojourn in the projectile; but they had already"
"x83","accomplished nearly seven-tenths of the way. This peculiarity was due"
"x83","to their regularly decreasing speed."
"x83",""
"x83","Now when they observed the earth through the lower window, it looked"
"x83","like nothing more than a dark spot, drowned in the solar rays. No more"
"x83","crescent, no more cloudy light! The next day, at midnight, the earth"
"x83","would be _new_, at the very moment when the moon would be full. Above,"
"x83","the orb of night was nearing the line followed by the projectile, so as"
"x83","to meet it at the given hour. All around the black vault was studded"
"x83","with brilliant points, which seemed to move slowly; but, at the great"
"x83","distance they were from them, their relative size did not seem to"
"x83","change. The sun and stars appeared exactly as they do to us upon earth."
"x83","As to the moon, she was considerably larger; but the travelers’"
"x83","glasses, not very powerful, did not allow them as yet to make any"
"x83","useful observations upon her surface, or reconnoiter her"
"x83","topographically or geologically."
"x83",""
"x83","Thus the time passed in never-ending conversations all about the moon."
"x83","Each one brought forward his own contingent of particular facts;"
"x83","Barbicane and Nicholl always serious, Michel Ardan always enthusiastic."
"x83","The projectile, its situation, its direction, incidents which might"
"x83","happen, the precautions necessitated by their fall on to the moon, were"
"x83","inexhaustible matters of conjecture."
"x83",""
"x83","As they were breakfasting, a question of Michel’s, relating to the"
"x83","projectile, provoked rather a curious answer from Barbicane, which is"
"x83","worth repeating. Michel, supposing it to be roughly stopped, while"
"x83","still under its formidable initial speed, wished to know what the"
"x83","consequences of the stoppage would have been."
"x83",""
"x83","“But,” said Barbicane, “I do not see how it could have been stopped.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“But let us suppose so,” said Michel."
"x83",""
"x83","“It is an impossible supposition,” said the practical Barbicane;"
"x83","“unless that impulsive force had failed; but even then its speed would"
"x83","diminish by degrees, and it would not have stopped suddenly.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Admit that it had struck a body in space.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“What body?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Why that enormous meteor which we met.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Then,” said Nicholl, “the projectile would have been broken into a"
"x83","thousand pieces, and we with it.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“More than that,” replied Barbicane; “we should have been burned to"
"x83","death.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Burned?” exclaimed Michel, “by Jove! I am sorry it did not happen,"
"x83","‘just to see.’”"
"x83",""
"x83","“And you would have seen,” replied Barbicane. “It is known now that"
"x83","heat is only a modification of motion. When water is warmed—that is to"
"x83","say, when heat is added to it—its particles are set in motion.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Well,” said Michel, “that is an ingenious theory!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“And a true one, my worthy friend; for it explains every phenomenon of"
"x83","caloric. Heat is but the motion of atoms, a simple oscillation of the"
"x83","particles of a body. When they apply the brake to a train, the train"
"x83","comes to a stop; but what becomes of the motion which it had previously"
"x83","possessed? It is transformed into heat, and the brake becomes hot. Why"
"x83","do they grease the axles of the wheels? To prevent their heating,"
"x83","because this heat would be generated by the motion which is thus lost"
"x83","by transformation.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes, I understand,” replied Michel, “perfectly. For example, when I"
"x83","have run a long time, when I am swimming, when I am perspiring in large"
"x83","drops, why am I obliged to stop? Simply because my motion is changed"
"x83","into heat.”"
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane could not help smiling at Michel’s reply; then, returning to"
"x83","his theory, said:"
"x83",""
"x83","“Thus, in case of a shock, it would have been with our projectile as"
"x83","with a ball which falls in a burning state after having struck the"
"x83","metal plate; it is its motion which is turned into heat. Consequently I"
"x83","affirm that, if our projectile had struck the meteor, its speed thus"
"x83","suddenly checked would have raised a heat great enough to turn it into"
"x83","vapor instantaneously.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Then,” asked Nicholl, “what would happen if the earth’s motion were to"
"x83","stop suddenly?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Her temperature would be raised to such a pitch,” said Barbicane,"
"x83","“that she would be at once reduced to vapor.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Well,” said Michel, “that is a way of ending the earth which will"
"x83","greatly simplify things.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“And if the earth fell upon the sun?” asked Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","“According to calculation,” replied Barbicane, “the fall would develop"
"x83","a heat equal to that produced by 16,000 globes of coal, each equal in"
"x83","bulk to our terrestrial globe.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Good additional heat for the sun,” replied Michel Ardan, “of which the"
"x83","inhabitants of Uranus or Neptune would doubtless not complain; they"
"x83","must be perished with cold on their planets.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Thus, my friends,” said Barbicane, “all motion suddenly stopped"
"x83","produces heat. And this theory allows us to infer that the heat of the"
"x83","solar disc is fed by a hail of meteors falling incessantly on its"
"x83","surface. They have even calculated—”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Oh, dear!” murmured Michel, “the figures are coming.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“They have even calculated,” continued the imperturbable Barbicane,"
"x83","“that the shock of each meteor on the sun ought to produce a heat equal"
"x83","to that of 4,000 masses of coal of an equal bulk.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“And what is the solar heat?” asked Michel."
"x83",""
"x83","“It is equal to that produced by the combustion of a stratum of coal"
"x83","surrounding the sun to a depth of forty-seven miles.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“And that heat—”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Would be able to boil two billions nine hundred millions of cubic"
"x83","myriameters[2] of water.”"
"x83",""
"x83"," [2] The myriameter is equal to rather more than 10,936 cubic yards"
"x83"," English."
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","“And it does not roast us!” exclaimed Michel."
"x83",""
"x83","“No,” replied Barbicane, “because the terrestrial atmosphere absorbs"
"x83","four-tenths of the solar heat; besides, the quantity of heat"
"x83","intercepted by the earth is but a billionth part of the entire"
"x83","radiation.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“I see that all is for the best,” said Michel, “and that this"
"x83","atmosphere is a useful invention; for it not only allows us to breathe,"
"x83","but it prevents us from roasting.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes!” said Nicholl, “unfortunately, it will not be the same in the"
"x83","moon.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Bah!” said Michel, always hopeful. “If there are inhabitants, they"
"x83","must breathe. If there are no longer any, they must have left enough"
"x83","oxygen for three people, if only at the bottom of ravines, where its"
"x83","own weight will cause it to accumulate, and we will not climb the"
"x83","mountains; that is all.” And Michel, rising, went to look at the lunar"
"x83","disc, which shone with intolerable brilliancy."
"x83",""
"x83","“By Jove!” said he, “it must be hot up there!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Without considering,” replied Nicholl, “that the day lasts 360 hours!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“And to compensate that,” said Barbicane, “the nights have the same"
"x83","length; and as heat is restored by radiation, their temperature can"
"x83","only be that of the planetary space.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“A pretty country, that!” exclaimed Michel. “Never mind! I wish I was"
"x83","there! Ah! my dear comrades, it will be rather curious to have the"
"x83","earth for our moon, to see it rise on the horizon, to recognize the"
"x83","shape of its continents, and to say to oneself, ‘There is America,"
"x83","there is Europe;’ then to follow it when it is about to lose itself in"
"x83","the sun’s rays! By the bye, Barbicane, have the Selenites eclipses?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes, eclipses of the sun,” replied Barbicane, “when the centers of the"
"x83","three orbs are on a line, the earth being in the middle. But they are"
"x83","only partial, during which the earth, cast like a screen upon the solar"
"x83","disc, allows the greater portion to be seen.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“And why,” asked Nicholl, “is there no total eclipse? Does not the cone"
"x83","of the shadow cast by the earth extend beyond the moon?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes, if we do not take into consideration the refraction produced by"
"x83","the terrestrial atmosphere. No, if we take that refraction into"
"x83","consideration. Thus let <lower case delta> be the horizontal parallel,"
"x83","and _p_ the apparent semidiameter—”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Oh!” said Michel. “Do speak plainly, you man of algebra!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Very well, replied Barbicane; “in popular language the mean distance"
"x83","from the moon to the earth being sixty terrestrial radii, the length of"
"x83","the cone of the shadow, on account of refraction, is reduced to less"
"x83","than forty-two radii. The result is that when there are eclipses, the"
"x83","moon finds itself beyond the cone of pure shadow, and that the sun"
"x83","sends her its rays, not only from its edges, but also from its center.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Then,” said Michel, in a merry tone, “why are there eclipses, when"
"x83","there ought not to be any?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Simply because the solar rays are weakened by this refraction, and the"
"x83","atmosphere through which they pass extinguished the greater part of"
"x83","them!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“That reason satisfies me,” replied Michel. “Besides we shall see when"
"x83","we get there. Now, tell me, Barbicane, do you believe that the moon is"
"x83","an old comet?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“There’s an idea!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes,” replied Michel, with an amiable swagger, “I have a few ideas of"
"x83","that sort.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“But that idea does not spring from Michel,” answered Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","“Well, then, I am a plagiarist.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“No doubt about it. According to the ancients, the Arcadians pretend"
"x83","that their ancestors inhabited the earth before the moon became her"
"x83","satellite. Starting from this fact, some scientific men have seen in"
"x83","the moon a comet whose orbit will one day bring it so near to the earth"
"x83","that it will be held there by its attraction.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Is there any truth in this hypothesis?” asked Michel."
"x83",""
"x83","“None whatever,” said Barbicane, “and the proof is, that the moon has"
"x83","preserved no trace of the gaseous envelope which always accompanies"
"x83","comets.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“But,” continued Nicholl, “Before becoming the earth’s satellite, could"
"x83","not the moon, when in her perihelion, pass so near the sun as by"
"x83","evaporation to get rid of all those gaseous substances?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“It is possible, friend Nicholl, but not probable.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Why not?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Because—Faith I do not know.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Ah!” exclaimed Michel, “what hundred of volumes we might make of all"
"x83","that we do not know!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Ah! indeed. What time is it?” asked Barbicane."
"x83",""
"x83","“Three o’clock,” answered Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","“How time goes,” said Michel, “in the conversation of scientific men"
"x83","such as we are! Certainly, I feel I know too much! I feel that I am"
"x83","becoming a well!”"
"x83",""
"x83","Saying which, Michel hoisted himself to the roof of the projectile, “to"
"x83","observe the moon better,” he pretended. During this time his companions"
"x83","were watching through the lower glass. Nothing new to note!"
"x83",""
"x83","When Michel Ardan came down, he went to the side scuttle; and suddenly"
"x83","they heard an exclamation of surprise!"
"x83",""
"x83","“What is it?” asked Barbicane."
"x83",""
"x83","The president approached the window, and saw a sort of flattened sack"
"x83","floating some yards from the projectile. This object seemed as"
"x83","motionless as the projectile, and was consequently animated with the"
"x83","same ascending movement."
"x83",""
"x83","“What is that machine?” continued Michel Ardan. “Is it one of the"
"x83","bodies which our projectile keeps within its attraction, and which will"
"x83","accompany it to the moon?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“What astonishes me,” said Nicholl, “is that the specific weight of the"
"x83","body, which is certainly less than that of the projectile, allows it to"
"x83","keep so perfectly on a level with it.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Nicholl,” replied Barbicane, after a moment’s reflection, “I do not"
"x83","know what the object it, but I do know why it maintains our level.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“And why?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Because we are floating in space, my dear captain, and in space bodies"
"x83","fall or move (which is the same thing) with equal speed whatever be"
"x83","their weight or form; it is the air, which by its resistance creates"
"x83","these differences in weight. When you create a vacuum in a tube, the"
"x83","objects you send through it, grains of dust or grains of lead, fall"
"x83","with the same rapidity. Here in space is the same cause and the same"
"x83","effect.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Just so,” said Nicholl, “and everything we throw out of the projectile"
"x83","will accompany it until it reaches the moon.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Ah! fools that we are!” exclaimed Michel."
"x83",""
"x83","“Why that expletive?” asked Barbicane."
"x83",""
"x83","“Because we might have filled the projectile with useful objects,"
"x83","books, instruments, tools, etc. We could have thrown them all out, and"
"x83","all would have followed in our train. But happy thought! Why cannot we"
"x83","walk outside like the meteor? Why cannot we launch into space through"
"x83","the scuttle? What enjoyment it would be to feel oneself thus suspended"
"x83","in ether, more favored than the birds who must use their wings to keep"
"x83","themselves up!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Granted,” said Barbicane, “but how to breathe?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Hang the air, to fail so inopportunely!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“But if it did not fail, Michel, your density being less than that of"
"x83","the projectile, you would soon be left behind.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Then we must remain in our car?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“We must!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Ah!” exclaimed Michel, in a load voice."
"x83",""
"x83","“What is the matter,” asked Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","“I know, I guess, what this pretended meteor is! It is no asteroid"
"x83","which is accompanying us! It is not a piece of a planet.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“What is it then?” asked Barbicane."
"x83",""
"x83","“It is our unfortunate dog! It is Diana’s husband!”"
"x83",""
"x83","Indeed, this deformed, unrecognizable object, reduced to nothing, was"
"x83","the body of Satellite, flattened like a bagpipe without wind, and ever"

"x83","CHAPTER VII."
"x83","A MOMENT OF INTOXICATION"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","Thus a phenomenon, curious but explicable, was happening under these"
"x83","strange conditions."
"x83",""
"x83","Every object thrown from the projectile would follow the same course"
"x83","and never stop until it did. There was a subject for conversation which"
"x83","the whole evening could not exhaust."
"x83",""
"x83","Besides, the excitement of the three travelers increased as they drew"
"x83","near the end of their journey. They expected unforseen incidents, and"
"x83","new phenomena; and nothing would have astonished them in the frame of"
"x83","mind they then were in. Their overexcited imagination went faster than"
"x83","the projectile, whose speed was evidently diminishing, though"
"x83","insensibly to themselves. But the moon grew larger to their eyes, and"
"x83","they fancied if they stretched out their hands they could seize it."
"x83",""
"x83","The next day, the 5th of November, at five in the morning, all three"
"x83","were on foot. That day was to be the last of their journey, if all"
"x83","calculations were true. That very night, at twelve o’clock, in eighteen"
"x83","hours, exactly at the full moon, they would reach its brilliant disc."
"x83","The next midnight would see that journey ended, the most extraordinary"
"x83","of ancient or modern times. Thus from the first of the morning, through"
"x83","the scuttles silvered by its rays, they saluted the orb of night with a"
"x83","confident and joyous hurrah."
"x83",""
"x83","The moon was advancing majestically along the starry firmament. A few"
"x83","more degrees, and she would reach the exact point where her meeting"
"x83","with the projectile was to take place."
"x83",""
"x83","According to his own observations, Barbicane reckoned that they would"
"x83","land on her northern hemisphere, where stretch immense plains, and"
"x83","where mountains are rare. A favorable circumstance if, as they thought,"
"x83","the lunar atmosphere was stored only in its depths."
"x83",""
"x83","“Besides,” observed Michel Ardan, “a plain is easier to disembark upon"
"x83","than a mountain. A Selenite, deposited in Europe on the summit of Mont"
"x83","Blanc, or in Asia on the top of the Himalayas, would not be quite in"
"x83","the right place.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“And,” added Captain Nicholl, “on a flat ground, the projectile will"
"x83","remain motionless when it has once touched; whereas on a declivity it"
"x83","would roll like an avalanche, and not being squirrels we should not"
"x83","come out safe and sound. So it is all for the best.”"
"x83",""
"x83","Indeed, the success of the audacious attempt no longer appeared"
"x83","doubtful. But Barbicane was preoccupied with one thought; but not"
"x83","wishing to make his companions uneasy, he kept silence on this subject."
"x83",""
"x83","The direction the projectile was taking toward the moon’s northern"
"x83","hemisphere, showed that her course had been slightly altered. The"
"x83","discharge, mathematically calculated, would carry the projectile to the"
"x83","very center of the lunar disc. If it did not land there, there must"
"x83","have been some deviation. What had caused it? Barbicane could neither"
"x83","imagine nor determine the importance of the deviation, for there were"
"x83","no points to go by."
"x83",""
"x83","He hoped, however, that it would have no other result than that of"
"x83","bringing them nearer the upper border of the moon, a region more"
"x83","suitable for landing."
"x83",""
"x83","Without imparting his uneasiness to his companions, Barbicane contented"
"x83","himself with constantly observing the moon, in order to see whether the"
"x83","course of the projectile would not be altered; for the situation would"
"x83","have been terrible if it failed in its aim, and being carried beyond"
"x83","the disc should be launched into interplanetary space. At that moment,"
"x83","the moon, instead of appearing flat like a disc, showed its convexity."
"x83","If the sun’s rays had struck it obliquely, the shadow thrown would have"
"x83","brought out the high mountains, which would have been clearly detached."
"x83","The eye might have gazed into the crater’s gaping abysses, and followed"
"x83","the capricious fissures which wound through the immense plains. But all"
"x83","relief was as yet leveled in intense brilliancy. They could scarcely"
"x83","distinguish those large spots which give the moon the appearance of a"
"x83","human face."
"x83",""
"x83","“Face, indeed!” said Michel Ardan; “but I am sorry for the amiable"
"x83","sister of Apollo. A very pitted face!”"
"x83",""
"x83","But the travelers, now so near the end, were incessantly observing this"
"x83","new world. They imagined themselves walking through its unknown"
"x83","countries, climbing its highest peaks, descending into its lowest"
"x83","depths. Here and there they fancied they saw vast seas, scarcely kept"
"x83","together under so rarefied an atmosphere, and water-courses emptying"
"x83","the mountain tributaries. Leaning over the abyss, they hoped to catch"
"x83","some sounds from that orb forever mute in the solitude of space. That"
"x83","last day left them."
"x83",""
"x83","They took down the most trifling details. A vague uneasiness took"
"x83","possession of them as they neared the end. This uneasiness would have"
"x83","been doubled had they felt how their speed had decreased. It would have"
"x83","seemed to them quite insufficient to carry them to the end. It was"
"x83","because the projectile then “weighed” almost nothing. Its weight was"
"x83","ever decreasing, and would be entirely annihilated on that line where"
"x83","the lunar and terrestrial attractions would neutralize each other."
"x83",""
"x83","But in spite of his preoccupation, Michel Ardan did not forget to"
"x83","prepare the morning repast with his accustomed punctuality. They ate"
"x83","with a good appetite. Nothing was so excellent as the soup liquefied by"
"x83","the heat of the gas; nothing better than the preserved meat. Some"
"x83","glasses of good French wine crowned the repast, causing Michel Ardan to"
"x83","remark that the lunar vines, warmed by that ardent sun, ought to"
"x83","distill even more generous wines; that is, if they existed. In any"
"x83","case, the far-seeing Frenchman had taken care not to forget in his"
"x83","collection some precious cuttings of the Medoc and Cote d’Or, upon"
"x83","which he founded his hopes."
"x83",""
"x83","Reiset and Regnaut’s apparatus worked with great regularity. Not an"
"x83","atom of carbonic acid resisted the potash; and as to the oxygen,"
"x83","Captain Nicholl said “it was of the first quality.” The little watery"
"x83","vapor enclosed in the projectile mixing with the air tempered the"
"x83","dryness; and many apartments in London, Paris, or New York, and many"
"x83","theaters, were certainly not in such a healthy condition."
"x83",""
"x83","But that it might act with regularity, the apparatus must be kept in"
"x83","perfect order; so each morning Michel visited the escape regulators,"
"x83","tried the taps, and regulated the heat of the gas by the pyrometer."
"x83","Everything had gone well up to that time, and the travelers, imitating"
"x83","the worthy Joseph T. Maston, began to acquire a degree of embonpoint"
"x83","which would have rendered them unrecognizable if their imprisonment had"
"x83","been prolonged to some months. In a word, they behaved like chickens in"
"x83","a coop; they were getting fat."
"x83",""
"x83","In looking through the scuttle Barbicane saw the specter of the dog,"
"x83","and other divers objects which had been thrown from the projectile,"
"x83","obstinately following them. Diana howled lugubriously on seeing the"
"x83","remains of Satellite, which seemed as motionless as if they reposed on"
"x83","solid earth."
"x83",""
"x83","“Do you know, my friends,” said Michel Ardan, “that if one of us had"
"x83","succumbed to the shock consequent on departure, we should have had a"
"x83","great deal of trouble to bury him? What am I saying? to _etherize_ him,"
"x83","as here ether takes the place of earth. You see the accusing body would"
"x83","have followed us into space like a remorse.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“That would have been sad,” said Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","“Ah!” continued Michel, “what I regret is not being able to take a walk"
"x83","outside. What voluptuousness to float amid this radiant ether, to bathe"
"x83","oneself in it, to wrap oneself in the sun’s pure rays. If Barbicane had"
"x83","only thought of furnishing us with a diving apparatus and an air-pump,"
"x83","I could have ventured out and assumed fanciful attitudes of feigned"
"x83","monsters on the top of the projectile.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Well, old Michel,” replied Barbicane, “you would not have made a"
"x83","feigned monster long, for in spite of your diver’s dress, swollen by"
"x83","the expansion of air within you, you would have burst like a shell, or"
"x83","rather like a balloon which has risen too high. So do not regret it,"
"x83","and do not forget this—as long as we float in space, all sentimental"
"x83","walks beyond the projectile are forbidden.”"
"x83",""
"x83","Michel Ardan allowed himself to be convinced to a certain extent. He"
"x83","admitted that the thing was difficult but not impossible, a word which"
"x83","he never uttered."
"x83",""
"x83","The conversation passed from this subject to another, not failing him"
"x83","for an instant. It seemed to the three friends as though, under present"
"x83","conditions, ideas shot up in their brains as leaves shoot at the first"
"x83","warmth of spring. They felt bewildered. In the middle of the questions"
"x83","and answers which crossed each other, Nicholl put one question which"
"x83","did not find an immediate solution."
"x83",""
"x83","“Ah, indeed!” said he; “it is all very well to go to the moon, but how"
"x83","to get back again?”"

"x83","His two interlocutors looked surprised. One would have thought that"
"x83","this possibility now occurred to them for the first time."
"x83",""
"x83","“What do you mean by that, Nicholl?” asked Barbicane gravely."
"x83",""
"x83","“To ask for means to leave a country,” added Michel, “When we have not"
"x83","yet arrived there, seems to me rather inopportune.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“I do not say that, wishing to draw back,” replied Nicholl; “but I"
"x83","repeat my question, and I ask, ‘How shall we return?’”"
"x83",""

"x83","“I quite approve of Michel’s words,” said Barbicane; “and add, that the"

"x83","“The gun,” replied Barbicane, “can be manufactured. The powder can be"
"x83","made. Neither metals, saltpeter, nor coal can fail in the depths of the"
"x83","moon, and we need only go 8,000 leagues in order to fall upon the"
"x83","terrestrial globe by virtue of the mere laws of weight.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Enough,” said Michel with animation. “Let it be no longer a question"
"x83","of returning: we have already entertained it too long. As to"
"x83","communicating with our former earthly colleagues, that will not be"
"x83","difficult.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“And how?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“By means of meteors launched by lunar volcanoes.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Well thought of, Michel,” said Barbicane in a convinced tone of voice."
"x83","“Laplace has calculated that a force five times greater than that of"
"x83","our gun would suffice to send a meteor from the moon to the earth, and"
"x83","there is not one volcano which has not a greater power of propulsion"
"x83","than that.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Hurrah!” exclaimed Michel; “these meteors are handy postmen, and cost"
"x83","nothing. And how we shall be able to laugh at the post-office"
"x83","administration! But now I think of it—”"
"x83",""
"x83","“What do you think of?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“A capital idea. Why did we not fasten a thread to our projectile, and"
"x83","we could have exchanged telegrams with the earth?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“The deuce!” answered Nicholl. “Do you consider the weight of a thread"
"x83","250,000 miles long nothing?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“As nothing. They could have trebled the Columbiad’s charge; they could"
"x83","have quadrupled or quintupled it!” exclaimed Michel, with whom the verb"
"x83","took a higher intonation each time."
"x83",""
"x83","“There is but one little objection to make to your proposition,”"
"x83","replied Barbicane, “which is that, during the rotary motion of the"
"x83","globe, our thread would have wound itself round it like a chain on a"
"x83","capstan, and that it would inevitably have brought us to the ground.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“By the thirty-nine stars of the Union!” said Michel, “I have nothing"
"x83","but impracticable ideas to-day; ideas worthy of J. T. Maston. But I"
"x83","have a notion that, if we do not return to earth, J. T. Maston will be"
"x83","able to come to us.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes, he’ll come,” replied Barbicane; “he is a worthy and a courageous"
"x83","comrade. Besides, what is easier? Is not the Columbiad still buried in"
"x83","the soil of Florida? Is cotton and nitric acid wanted wherewith to"
"x83","manufacture the pyroxyle? Will not the moon pass the zenith of Florida?"
"x83","In eighteen years’ time will she not occupy exactly the same place as"
"x83","to-day?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes,” continued Michel, “yes, Maston will come, and with him our"
"x83","friends Elphinstone, Blomsberry, all the members of the Gun Club, and"
"x83","they will be well received. And by and by they will run trains of"
"x83","projectiles between the earth and the moon! Hurrah for J. T. Maston!”"
"x83",""
"x83","It is probable that, if the Hon. J. T. Maston did not hear the hurrahs"
"x83","uttered in his honor, his ears at least tingled. What was he doing"
"x83","then? Doubtless, posted in the Rocky Mountains, at the station of"
"x83","Long’s Peak, he was trying to find the invisible projectile gravitating"
"x83","in space. If he was thinking of his dear companions, we must allow that"
"x83","they were not far behind him; and that, under the influence of a"
"x83","strange excitement, they were devoting to him their best thoughts."
"x83",""
"x83","But whence this excitement, which was evidently growing upon the"
"x83","tenants of the projectile? Their sobriety could not be doubted. This"
"x83","strange irritation of the brain, must it be attributed to the peculiar"
"x83","circumstances under which they found themselves, to their proximity to"
"x83","the orb of night, from which only a few hours separated them, to some"
"x83","secret influence of the moon acting upon their nervous system? Their"
"x83","faces were as rosy as if they had been exposed to the roaring flames of"
"x83","an oven; their voices resounded in loud accents; their words escaped"
"x83","like a champagne cork driven out by carbonic acid; their gestures"
"x83","became annoying, they wanted so much room to perform them; and, strange"
"x83","to say, they none of them noticed this great tension of the mind."
"x83",""
"x83","“Now,” said Nicholl, in a short tone, “now that I do not know whether"
"x83","we shall ever return from the moon, I want to know what we are going to"
"x83","do there?”"

"x83","“Captain,” said Michel, “do not repeat that insolence, or I will knock"

"x83",""
"x83","The two adversaries were going to fall upon each other, and the"

"x83","“Stop, miserable men,” said he, separating his two companions; “if"

"x83","CHAPTER VIII."
"x83","AT SEVENTY-EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN LEAGUES"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","What had happened? Whence the cause of this singular intoxication, the"
"x83","consequences of which might have been very disastrous? A simple blunder"
"x83","of Michel’s, which, fortunately, Nicholl was able to correct in time."
"x83",""
"x83","After a perfect swoon, which lasted some minutes, the captain,"
"x83","recovering first, soon collected his scattered senses. Although he had"
"x83","breakfasted only two hours before, he felt a gnawing hunger, as if he"
"x83","had not eaten anything for several days. Everything about him, stomach"
"x83","and brain, were overexcited to the highest degree. He got up and"
"x83","demanded from Michel a supplementary repast. Michel, utterly done up,"
"x83","did not answer."
"x83",""
"x83","Nicholl then tried to prepare some tea destined to help the absorption"
"x83","of a dozen sandwiches. He first tried to get some fire, and struck a"
"x83","match sharply. What was his surprise to see the sulphur shine with so"
"x83","extraordinary a brilliancy as to be almost unbearable to the eye. From"
"x83","the gas-burner which he lit rose a flame equal to a jet of electric"
"x83","light."
"x83",""
"x83","A revelation dawned on Nicholl’s mind. That intensity of light, the"
"x83","physiological troubles which had arisen in him, the overexcitement of"
"x83","all his moral and quarrelsome faculties—he understood all."
"x83",""
"x83","“The oxygen!” he exclaimed."
"x83",""
"x83","And leaning over the air apparatus, he saw that the tap was allowing"
"x83","the colorless gas to escape freely, life-giving, but in its pure state"
"x83","producing the gravest disorders in the system. Michel had blunderingly"
"x83","opened the tap of the apparatus to the full."
"x83",""
"x83","Nicholl hastened to stop the escape of oxygen with which the atmosphere"
"x83","was saturated, which would have been the death of the travelers, not by"
"x83","suffocation, but by combustion. An hour later, the air less charged"
"x83","with it restored the lungs to their normal condition. By degrees the"
"x83","three friends recovered from their intoxication; but they were obliged"
"x83","to sleep themselves sober over their oxygen as a drunkard does over his"
"x83","wine."
"x83",""
"x83","When Michel learned his share of the responsibility of this incident,"
"x83","he was not much disconcerted. This unexpected drunkenness broke the"
"x83","monotony of the journey. Many foolish things had been said while under"
"x83","its influence, but also quickly forgotten."
"x83",""
"x83","“And then,” added the merry Frenchman, “I am not sorry to have tasted a"
"x83","little of this heady gas. Do you know, my friends, that a curious"
"x83","establishment might be founded with rooms of oxygen, where people whose"
"x83","system is weakened could for a few hours live a more active life. Fancy"
"x83","parties where the room was saturated with this heroic fluid, theaters"
"x83","where it should be kept at high pressure; what passion in the souls of"
"x83","the actors and spectators! what fire, what enthusiasm! And if, instead"
"x83","of an assembly only a whole people could be saturated, what activity in"
"x83","its functions, what a supplement to life it would derive. From an"
"x83","exhausted nation they might make a great and strong one, and I know"
"x83","more than one state in old Europe which ought to put itself under the"
"x83","regime of oxygen for the sake of its health!”"
"x83",""
"x83","Michel spoke with so much animation that one might have fancied that"
"x83","the tap was still too open. But a few words from Barbicane soon"
"x83","shattered his enthusiasm."
"x83",""
"x83","“That is all very well, friend Michel,” said he, “but will you inform"
"x83","us where these chickens came from which have mixed themselves up in our"
"x83","concert?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Those chickens?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes.”"
"x83",""
"x83","Indeed, half a dozen chickens and a fine cock were walking about,"
"x83","flapping their wings and chattering."
"x83",""
"x83","“Ah, the awkward things!” exclaimed Michel. “The oxygen has made them"
"x83","revolt.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“But what do you want to do with these chickens?” asked Barbicane."
"x83",""
"x83","“To acclimatize them in the moon, by Jove!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Then why did you hide them?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“A joke, my worthy president, a simple joke, which has proved a"
"x83","miserable failure. I wanted to set them free on the lunar continent,"
"x83","without saying anything. Oh, what would have been your amazement on"
"x83","seeing these earthly-winged animals pecking in your lunar fields!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“You rascal, you unmitigated rascal,” replied Barbicane, “you do not"
"x83","want oxygen to mount to the head. You are always what we were under the"
"x83","influence of the gas; you are always foolish!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Ah, who says that we were not wise then?” replied Michel Ardan."
"x83",""
"x83","After this philosophical reflection, the three friends set about"
"x83","restoring the order of the projectile. Chickens and cock were"
"x83","reinstated in their coop. But while proceeding with this operation,"
"x83","Barbicane and his two companions had a most desired perception of a new"
"x83","phenomenon. From the moment of leaving the earth, their own weight,"
"x83","that of the projectile, and the objects it enclosed, had been subject"
"x83","to an increasing diminution. If they could not prove this loss of the"
"x83","projectile, a moment would arrive when it would be sensibly felt upon"
"x83","themselves and the utensils and instruments they used."
"x83",""
"x83","It is needless to say that a scale would not show this loss; for the"
"x83","weight destined to weight the object would have lost exactly as much as"
"x83","the object itself; but a spring steelyard for example, the tension of"
"x83","which was independent of the attraction, would have given a just"
"x83","estimate of this loss."
"x83",""
"x83","We know that the attraction, otherwise called the weight, is in"
"x83","proportion to the densities of the bodies, and inversely as the squares"
"x83","of the distances. Hence this effect: If the earth had been alone in"
"x83","space, if the other celestial bodies had been suddenly annihilated, the"
"x83","projectile, according to Newton’s laws, would weigh less as it got"
"x83","farther from the earth, but without ever losing its weight entirely,"
"x83","for the terrestrial attraction would always have made itself felt, at"
"x83","whatever distance."
"x83",""
"x83","But, in reality, a time must come when the projectile would no longer"
"x83","be subject to the law of weight, after allowing for the other celestial"
"x83","bodies whose effect could not be set down as zero. Indeed, the"
"x83","projectile’s course was being traced between the earth and the moon. As"
"x83","it distanced the earth, the terrestrial attraction diminished: but the"
"x83","lunar attraction rose in proportion. There must come a point where"
"x83","these two attractions would neutralize each other: the projectile would"
"x83","possess weight no longer. If the moon’s and the earth’s densities had"
"x83","been equal, this point would have been at an equal distance between the"
"x83","two orbs. But taking the different densities into consideration, it was"
"x83","easy to reckon that this point would be situated at 47/60ths of the"
"x83","whole journey, _i.e._, at 78,514 leagues from the earth. At this point,"
"x83","a body having no principle of speed or displacement in itself, would"
"x83","remain immovable forever, being attracted equally by both orbs, and not"
"x83","being drawn more toward one than toward the other."
"x83",""
"x83","Now if the projectile’s impulsive force had been correctly calculated,"
"x83","it would attain this point without speed, having lost all trace of"
"x83","weight, as well as all the objects within it. What would happen then?"
"x83","Three hypotheses presented themselves."
"x83",""
"x83","1. Either it would retain a certain amount of motion, and pass the"
"x83","point of equal attraction, and fall upon the moon by virtue of the"
"x83","excess of the lunar attraction over the terrestrial."
"x83",""
"x83","2. Or, its speed failing, and unable to reach the point of equal"
"x83","attraction, it would fall upon the moon by virtue of the excess of the"
"x83","lunar attraction over the terrestrial."
"x83",""
"x83","3. Or, lastly, animated with sufficient speed to enable it to reach the"
"x83","neutral point, but not sufficient to pass it, it would remain forever"
"x83","suspended in that spot like the pretended tomb of Mahomet, between the"
"x83","zenith and the nadir."
"x83",""
"x83","Such was their situation; and Barbicane clearly explained the"
"x83","consequences to his traveling companions, which greatly interested"
"x83","them. But how should they know when the projectile had reached this"
"x83","neutral point situated at that distance, especially when neither"
"x83","themselves, nor the objects enclosed in the projectile, would be any"
"x83","longer subject to the laws of weight?"
"x83",""
"x83","Up to this time, the travelers, while admitting that this action was"
"x83","constantly decreasing, had not yet become sensible to its total"
"x83","absence."
"x83",""
"x83","But that day, about eleven o’clock in the morning, Nicholl having"
"x83","accidentally let a glass slip from his hand, the glass, instead of"
"x83","falling, remained suspended in the air."
"x83",""
"x83","“Ah!” exclaimed Michel Ardan, “that is rather an amusing piece of"
"x83","natural philosophy.”"
"x83",""
"x83","And immediately divers other objects, firearms and bottles, abandoned"
"x83","to themselves, held themselves up as by enchantment. Diana too, placed"
"x83","in space by Michel, reproduced, but without any trick, the wonderful"
"x83","suspension practiced by Caston and Robert Houdin. Indeed the dog did"
"x83","not seem to know that she was floating in air."
"x83",""
"x83","The three adventurous companions were surprised and stupefied, despite"
"x83","their scientific reasonings. They felt themselves being carried into"
"x83","the domain of wonders! they felt that weight was really wanting to"
"x83","their bodies. If they stretched out their arms, they did not attempt to"
"x83","fall. Their heads shook on their shoulders. Their feet no longer clung"
"x83","to the floor of the projectile. They were like drunken men having no"
"x83","stability in themselves."
"x83",""
"x83","Fancy has depicted men without reflection, others without shadow. But"
"x83","here reality, by the neutralizations of attractive forces, produced men"
"x83","in whom nothing had any weight, and who weighed nothing themselves."
"x83",""
"x83","Suddenly Michel, taking a spring, left the floor and remained suspended"
"x83","in the air, like Murillo’s monk of the _Cusine des Anges_."
"x83",""
"x83","The two friends joined him instantly, and all three formed a miraculous"
"x83","“Ascension” in the center of the projectile."
"x83",""
"x83","“Is it to be believed? is it probable? is it possible?” exclaimed"
"x83","Michel; “and yet it is so. Ah! if Raphael had seen us thus, what an"
"x83","‘Assumption’ he would have thrown upon canvas!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“The ‘Assumption’ cannot last,” replied Barbicane. “If the projectile"
"x83","passes the neutral point, the lunar attraction will draw us to the"
"x83","moon.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Then our feet will be upon the roof,” replied Michel."
"x83",""
"x83","“No,” said Barbicane, “because the projectile’s center of gravity is"
"x83","very low; it will only turn by degrees.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Then all our portables will be upset from top to bottom, that is a"
"x83","fact.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Calm yourself, Michel,” replied Nicholl; “no upset is to be feared;"
"x83","not a thing will move, for the projectile’s evolution will be"
"x83","imperceptible.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Just so,” continued Barbicane; “and when it has passed the point of"
"x83","equal attraction, its base, being the heavier, will draw it"
"x83","perpendicularly to the moon; but, in order that this phenomenon should"
"x83","take place, we must have passed the neutral line.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Pass the neutral line,” cried Michel; “then let us do as the sailors"
"x83","do when they cross the equator.”"
"x83",""
"x83","A slight side movement brought Michel back toward the padded side;"
"x83","thence he took a bottle and glasses, placed them “in space” before his"
"x83","companions, and, drinking merrily, they saluted the line with a triple"
"x83","hurrah. The influence of these attractions scarcely lasted an hour; the"
"x83","travelers felt themselves insensibly drawn toward the floor, and"
"x83","Barbicane fancied that the conical end of the projectile was varying a"
"x83","little from its normal direction toward the moon. By an inverse motion"
"x83","the base was approaching first; the lunar attraction was prevailing"
"x83","over the terrestrial; the fall toward the moon was beginning, almost"
"x83","imperceptibly as yet, but by degrees the attractive force would become"
"x83","stronger, the fall would be more decided, the projectile, drawn by its"
"x83","base, would turn its cone to the earth, and fall with ever-increasing"
"x83","speed on to the surface of the Selenite continent; their destination"
"x83","would then be attained. Now nothing could prevent the success of their"
"x83","enterprise, and Nicholl and Michel Ardan shared Barbicane’s joy."
"x83",""
"x83","Then they chatted of all the phenomena which had astonished them one"
"x83","after the other, particularly the neutralization of the laws of weight."
"x83","Michel Ardan, always enthusiastic, drew conclusions which were purely"
"x83","fanciful."
"x83",""
"x83","“Ah, my worthy friends,” he exclaimed, “what progress we should make if"
"x83","on earth we could throw off some of that weight, some of that chain"
"x83","which binds us to her; it would be the prisoner set at liberty; no more"
"x83","fatigue of either arms or legs. Or, if it is true that in order to fly"
"x83","on the earth’s surface, to keep oneself suspended in the air merely by"
"x83","the play of the muscles, there requires a strength a hundred and fifty"
"x83","times greater than that which we possess, a simple act of volition, a"
"x83","caprice, would bear us into space, if attraction did not exist.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Just so,” said Nicholl, smiling; “if we could succeed in suppressing"
"x83","weight as they suppress pain by anaesthesia, that would change the face"
"x83","of modern society!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes,” cried Michel, full of his subject, “destroy weight, and no more"
"x83","burdens!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Well said,” replied Barbicane; “but if nothing had any weight, nothing"
"x83","would keep in its place, not even your hat on your head, worthy Michel;"
"x83","nor your house, whose stones only adhere by weight; nor a boat, whose"
"x83","stability on the waves is only caused by weight; not even the ocean,"
"x83","whose waves would no longer be equalized by terrestrial attraction; and"
"x83","lastly, not even the atmosphere, whose atoms, being no longer held in"

"x83","“That is tiresome,” retorted Michel; “nothing like these matter-of-fact"

"x83","“The moon?”"

"x83","“Yes,” replied Nicholl; “for if the height of the Selenites is in"
"x83","proportion to the density of their globe, they will be scarcely a foot"
"x83","high.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Lilliputians!” ejaculated Michel; “I shall play the part of Gulliver."
"x83","We are going to realize the fable of the giants. This is the advantage"
"x83","of leaving one’s own planet and over-running the solar world.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“One moment, Michel,” answered Barbicane; “if you wish to play the part"
"x83","of Gulliver, only visit the inferior planets, such as Mercury, Venus,"
"x83","or Mars, whose density is a little less than that of the earth; but do"
"x83","not venture into the great planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune;"
"x83","for there the order will be changed, and you will become Lilliputian.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“And in the sun?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“In the sun, if its density is thirteen hundred and twenty-four"
"x83","thousand times greater, and the attraction is twenty-seven times"
"x83","greater than on the surface of our globe, keeping everything in"
"x83","proportion, the inhabitants ought to be at least two hundred feet"

"x83","“By Jove!” exclaimed Michel; “I should be nothing more than a pigmy, a"

"x83","“Gulliver with the giants,” said Nicholl."

"x83","“Just so,” replied Barbicane."

"x83","“And it would not be quite useless to carry some pieces of artillery to"
"x83","defend oneself.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Good,” replied Nicholl; “your projectiles would have no effect on the"
"x83","sun; they would fall back upon the earth after some minutes.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“That is a strong remark.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“It is certain,” replied Barbicane; “the attraction is so great on this"
"x83","enormous orb, that an object weighing 70,000 pounds on the earth would"
"x83","weigh but 1,920 pounds on the surface of the sun. If you were to fall"
"x83","upon it you would weigh—let me see—about 5,000 pounds, a weight which"
"x83","you would never be able to raise again.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“The devil!” said Michel; “one would want a portable crane. However, we"

"x83","CHAPTER IX."
"x83","THE CONSEQUENCES OF A DEVIATION"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane had now no fear of the issue of the journey, at least as far"
"x83","as the projectile’s impulsive force was concerned; its own speed would"
"x83","carry it beyond the neutral line; it would certainly not return to"
"x83","earth; it would certainly not remain motionless on the line of"
"x83","attraction. One single hypothesis remained to be realized, the arrival"
"x83","of the projectile at its destination by the action of the lunar"
"x83","attraction."
"x83",""
"x83","It was in reality a fall of 8,296 leagues on an orb, it is true, where"
"x83","weight could only be reckoned at one sixth of terrestrial weight; a"
"x83","formidable fall, nevertheless, and one against which every precaution"
"x83","must be taken without delay."
"x83",""
"x83","These precautions were of two sorts, some to deaden the shock when the"
"x83","projectile should touch the lunar soil, others to delay the fall, and"
"x83","consequently make it less violent."
"x83",""
"x83","To deaden the shock, it was a pity that Barbicane was no longer able to"
"x83","employ the means which had so ably weakened the shock at departure,"
"x83","that is to say, by water used as springs and the partition breaks."
"x83",""
"x83","The partitions still existed, but water failed, for they could not use"
"x83","their reserve, which was precious, in case during the first days the"
"x83","liquid element should be found wanting on lunar soil."
"x83",""
"x83","And indeed this reserve would have been quite insufficient for a"
"x83","spring. The layer of water stored in the projectile at the time of"
"x83","starting upon their journey occupied no less than three feet in depth,"
"x83","and spread over a surface of not less than fifty-four square feet."
"x83","Besides, the cistern did not contain one-fifth part of it; they must"
"x83","therefore give up this efficient means of deadening the shock of"
"x83","arrival. Happily, Barbicane, not content with employing water, had"
"x83","furnished the movable disc with strong spring plugs, destined to lessen"
"x83","the shock against the base after the breaking of the horizontal"
"x83","partitions. These plugs still existed; they had only to readjust them"
"x83","and replace the movable disc; every piece, easy to handle, as their"
"x83","weight was now scarcely felt, was quickly mounted."
"x83",""
"x83","The different pieces were fitted without trouble, it being only a"
"x83","matter of bolts and screws; tools were not wanting, and soon the"
"x83","reinstated disc lay on steel plugs, like a table on its legs. One"
"x83","inconvenience resulted from the replacing of the disc, the lower window"
"x83","was blocked up; thus it was impossible for the travelers to observe the"
"x83","moon from that opening while they were being precipitated"
"x83","perpendicularly upon her; but they were obliged to give it up; even by"
"x83","the side openings they could still see vast lunar regions, as an"
"x83","aeronaut sees the earth from his car."
"x83",""
"x83","This replacing of the disc was at least an hour’s work. It was past"
"x83","twelve when all preparations were finished. Barbicane took fresh"
"x83","observations on the inclination of the projectile, but to his annoyance"
"x83","it had not turned over sufficiently for its fall; it seemed to take a"
"x83","curve parallel to the lunar disc. The orb of night shone splendidly"
"x83","into space, while opposite, the orb of day blazed with fire."
"x83",""
"x83","Their situation began to make them uneasy."
"x83",""
"x83","“Are we reaching our destination?” said Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","“Let us act as if we were about reaching it,” replied Barbicane."
"x83",""
"x83","“You are sceptical,” retorted Michel Ardan. “We shall arrive, and that,"
"x83","too, quicker than we like.”"
"x83",""
"x83","This answer brought Barbicane back to his preparations, and he occupied"
"x83","himself with placing the contrivances intended to break their descent."
"x83","We may remember the scene of the meeting held at Tampa Town, in"
"x83","Florida, when Captain Nicholl came forward as Barbicane’s enemy and"
"x83","Michel Ardan’s adversary. To Captain Nicholl’s maintaining that the"
"x83","projectile would smash like glass, Michel replied that he would break"
"x83","their fall by means of rockets properly placed."
"x83",""
"x83","Thus, powerful fireworks, taking their starting-point from the base and"
"x83","bursting outside, could, by producing a recoil, check to a certain"
"x83","degree the projectile’s speed. These rockets were to burn in space, it"
"x83","is true; but oxygen would not fail them, for they could supply"
"x83","themselves with it, like the lunar volcanoes, the burning of which has"
"x83","never yet been stopped by the want of atmosphere round the moon."
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane had accordingly supplied himself with these fireworks,"
"x83","enclosed in little steel guns, which could be screwed on to the base of"
"x83","the projectile. Inside, these guns were flush with the bottom; outside,"
"x83","they protruded about eighteen inches. There were twenty of them. An"
"x83","opening left in the disc allowed them to light the match with which"
"x83","each was provided. All the effect was felt outside. The burning mixture"
"x83","had already been rammed into each gun. They had, then, nothing to do"
"x83","but raise the metallic buffers fixed in the base, and replace them by"
"x83","the guns, which fitted closely in their places."
"x83",""
"x83","This new work was finished about three o’clock, and after taking all"
"x83","these precautions there remained but to wait. But the projectile was"
"x83","perceptibly nearing the moon, and evidently succumbed to her influence"
"x83","to a certain degree; though its own velocity also drew it in an oblique"
"x83","direction. From these conflicting influences resulted a line which"
"x83","might become a tangent. But it was certain that the projectile would"
"x83","not fall directly on the moon; for its lower part, by reason of its"
"x83","weight, ought to be turned toward her."
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane’s uneasiness increased as he saw his projectile resist the"
"x83","influence of gravitation. The Unknown was opening before him, the"
"x83","Unknown in interplanetary space. The man of science thought he had"
"x83","foreseen the only three hypotheses possible—the return to the earth,"
"x83","the return to the moon, or stagnation on the neutral line; and here a"
"x83","fourth hypothesis, big with all the terrors of the Infinite, surged up"
"x83","inopportunely. To face it without flinching, one must be a resolute"
"x83","savant like Barbicane, a phlegmatic being like Nicholl, or an audacious"
"x83","adventurer like Michel Ardan."
"x83",""
"x83","Conversation was started upon this subject. Other men would have"
"x83","considered the question from a practical point of view; they would have"
"x83","asked themselves whither their projectile carriage was carrying them."
"x83","Not so with these; they sought for the cause which produced this"
"x83","effect."
"x83",""
"x83","“So we have become diverted from our route,” said Michel; “but why?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“I very much fear,” answered Nicholl, “that, in spite of all"
"x83","precautions taken, the Columbiad was not fairly pointed. An error,"
"x83","however small, would be enough to throw us out of the moon’s"
"x83","attraction.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Then they must have aimed badly?” asked Michel."
"x83",""
"x83","“I do not think so,” replied Barbicane. “The perpendicularity of the"
"x83","gun was exact, its direction to the zenith of the spot incontestible;"
"x83","and the moon passing to the zenith of the spot, we ought to reach it at"
"x83","the full. There is another reason, but it escapes me.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Are we not arriving too late?” asked Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","“Too late?” said Barbicane."
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes,” continued Nicholl. “The Cambridge Observatory’s note says that"
"x83","the transit ought to be accomplished in ninety-seven hours thirteen"
"x83","minutes and twenty seconds; which means to say, that _sooner_ the moon"
"x83","will _not_ be at the point indicated, and _later_ it will have passed"
"x83","it.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“True,” replied Barbicane. “But we started the 1st of December, at"
"x83","thirteen minutes and twenty-five seconds to eleven at night; and we"
"x83","ought to arrive on the 5th at midnight, at the exact moment when the"
"x83","moon would be full; and we are now at the 5th of December. It is now"
"x83","half-past three in the evening; half-past eight ought to see us at the"
"x83","end of our journey. Why do we not arrive?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Might it not be an excess of speed?” answered Nicholl; “for we know"
"x83","now that its initial velocity was greater than they supposed.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“No! a hundred times, no!” replied Barbicane. “An excess of speed, if"
"x83","the direction of the projectile had been right, would not have"
"x83","prevented us reaching the moon. No, there has been a deviation. We have"
"x83","been turned out of our course.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“By whom? by what?” asked Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","“I cannot say,” replied Barbicane."
"x83",""
"x83","“Very well, then, Barbicane,” said Michel, “do you wish to know my"
"x83","opinion on the subject of finding out this deviation?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Speak.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“I would not give half a dollar to know it. That we have deviated is a"
"x83","fact. Where we are going matters little; we shall soon see. Since we"
"x83","are being borne along in space we shall end by falling into some center"
"x83","of attraction or other.”"
"x83",""
"x83","Michel Ardan’s indifference did not content Barbicane. Not that he was"
"x83","uneasy about the future, but he wanted to know at any cost _why_ his"
"x83","projectile had deviated."
"x83",""
"x83","But the projectile continued its course sideways to the moon, and with"
"x83","it the mass of things thrown out. Barbicane could even prove, by the"
"x83","elevations which served as landmarks upon the moon, which was only two"
"x83","thousand leagues distant, that its speed was becoming uniform—fresh"
"x83","proof that there was no fall. Its impulsive force still prevailed over"
"x83","the lunar attraction, but the projectile’s course was certainly"
"x83","bringing it nearer to the moon, and they might hope that at a nearer"
"x83","point the weight, predominating, would cause a decided fall."
"x83",""
"x83","The three friends, having nothing better to do, continued their"
"x83","observations; but they could not yet determine the topographical"
"x83","position of the satellite; every relief was leveled under the"
"x83","reflection of the solar rays."
"x83",""
"x83","They watched thus through the side windows until eight o’clock at"
"x83","night. The moon had grown so large in their eyes that it filled half of"
"x83","the firmament. The sun on one side, and the orb of night on the other,"
"x83","flooded the projectile with light."
"x83",""
"x83","At that moment Barbicane thought he could estimate the distance which"
"x83","separated them from their aim at no more than 700 leagues. The speed of"
"x83","the projectile seemed to him to be more than 200 yards, or about 170"
"x83","leagues a second. Under the centripetal force, the base of the"
"x83","projectile tended toward the moon; but the centrifugal still prevailed;"
"x83","and it was probable that its rectilineal course would be changed to a"
"x83","curve of some sort, the nature of which they could not at present"
"x83","determine."
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane was still seeking the solution of his insoluble problem."
"x83","Hours passed without any result. The projectile was evidently nearing"
"x83","the moon, but it was also evident that it would never reach her. As to"
"x83","the nearest distance at which it would pass her, that must be the"
"x83","result of two forces, attraction and repulsion, affecting its motion."
"x83",""
"x83","“I ask but one thing,” said Michel; “that we may pass near enough to"
"x83","penetrate her secrets.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Cursed be the thing that has caused our projectile to deviate from its"
"x83","course,” cried Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","And, as if a light had suddenly broken in upon his mind, Barbicane"
"x83","answered, “Then cursed be the meteor which crossed our path.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“What?” said Michel Ardan."
"x83",""
"x83","“What do you mean?” exclaimed Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","“I mean,” said Barbicane in a decided tone, “I mean that our deviation"
"x83","is owing solely to our meeting with this erring body.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“But it did not even brush us as it passed,” said Michel."
"x83",""
"x83","“What does that matter? Its mass, compared to that of our projectile,"
"x83","was enormous, and its attraction was enough to influence our course.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“So little?” cried Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes, Nicholl; but however little it might be,” replied Barbicane, “in"
"x83","a distance of 84,000 leagues, it wanted no more to make us miss the"
"x83","moon.”"

"x83","CHAPTER X."
"x83","THE OBSERVERS OF THE MOON"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane had evidently hit upon the only plausible reason of this"
"x83","deviation. However slight it might have been, it had sufficed to modify"
"x83","the course of the projectile. It was a fatality. The bold attempt had"
"x83","miscarried by a fortuitous circumstance; and unless by some exceptional"
"x83","event, they could now never reach the moon’s disc."
"x83",""
"x83","Would they pass near enough to be able to solve certain physical and"
"x83","geological questions until then insoluble? This was the question, and"
"x83","the only one, which occupied the minds of these bold travelers. As to"
"x83","the fate in store for themselves, they did not even dream of it."
"x83",""
"x83","But what would become of them amid these infinite solitudes, these who"
"x83","would soon want air? A few more days, and they would fall stifled in"
"x83","this wandering projectile. But some days to these intrepid fellows was"
"x83","a century; and they devoted all their time to observe that moon which"
"x83","they no longer hoped to reach."
"x83",""
"x83","The distance which had then separated the projectile from the satellite"
"x83","was estimated at about two hundred leagues. Under these conditions, as"
"x83","regards the visibility of the details of the disc, the travelers were"
"x83","farther from the moon than are the inhabitants of earth with their"
"x83","powerful telescopes."
"x83",""
"x83","Indeed, we know that the instrument mounted by Lord Rosse at"
"x83","Parsonstown, which magnifies 6,500 times, brings the moon to within an"
"x83","apparent distance of sixteen leagues. And more than that, with the"
"x83","powerful one set up at Long’s Peak, the orb of night, magnified 48,000"
"x83","times, is brought to within less than two leagues, and objects having a"
"x83","diameter of thirty feet are seen very distinctly. So that, at this"
"x83","distance, the topographical details of the moon, observed without"
"x83","glasses, could not be determined with precision. The eye caught the"
"x83","vast outline of those immense depressions inappropriately called"
"x83","“seas,” but they could not recognize their nature. The prominence of"
"x83","the mountains disappeared under the splendid irradiation produced by"
"x83","the reflection of the solar rays. The eye, dazzled as if it was leaning"
"x83","over a bath of molten silver, turned from it involuntarily; but the"
"x83","oblong form of the orb was quite clear. It appeared like a gigantic"
"x83","egg, with the small end turned toward the earth. Indeed the moon,"
"x83","liquid and pliable in the first days of its formation, was originally a"
"x83","perfect sphere; but being soon drawn within the attraction of the"
"x83","earth, it became elongated under the influence of gravitation. In"
"x83","becoming a satellite, she lost her native purity of form; her center of"
"x83","gravity was in advance of the center of her figure; and from this fact"
"x83","some savants draw the conclusion that the air and water had taken"
"x83","refuge on the opposite surface of the moon, which is never seen from"
"x83","the earth. This alteration in the primitive form of the satellite was"
"x83","only perceptible for a few moments. The distance of the projectile from"
"x83","the moon diminished very rapidly under its speed, though that was much"
"x83","less than its initial velocity—but eight or nine times greater than"
"x83","that which propels our express trains. The oblique course of the"
"x83","projectile, from its very obliquity, gave Michel Ardan some hopes of"
"x83","striking the lunar disc at some point or other. He could not think that"
"x83","they would never reach it. No! he could not believe it; and this"
"x83","opinion he often repeated. But Barbicane, who was a better judge,"
"x83","always answered him with merciless logic."
"x83",""
"x83","“No, Michel, no! We can only reach the moon by a fall, and we are not"
"x83","falling. The centripetal force keeps us under the moon’s influence, but"
"x83","the centrifugal force draws us irresistibly away from it.”"
"x83",""
"x83","This was said in a tone which quenched Michel Ardan’s last hope."
"x83",""
"x83","The portion of the moon which the projectile was nearing was the"
"x83","northern hemisphere, that which the selenographic maps place below; for"
"x83","these maps are generally drawn after the outline given by the glasses,"
"x83","and we know that they reverse the objects. Such was the _Mappa"
"x83","Selenographica_ of Boeer and Moedler which Barbicane consulted. This"
"x83","northern hemisphere presented vast plains, dotted with isolated"
"x83","mountains."
"x83",""
"x83","At midnight the moon was full. At that precise moment the travelers"
"x83","should have alighted upon it, if the mischievous meteor had not"
"x83","diverted their course. The orb was exactly in the condition determined"
"x83","by the Cambridge Observatory. It was mathematically at its perigee, and"
"x83","at the zenith of the twenty-eighth parallel. An observer placed at the"
"x83","bottom of the enormous Columbiad, pointed perpendicularly to the"
"x83","horizon, would have framed the moon in the mouth of the gun. A straight"
"x83","line drawn through the axis of the piece would have passed through the"
"x83","center of the orb of night. It is needless to say, that during the"
"x83","night of the 5th-6th of December, the travelers took not an instant’s"
"x83","rest. Could they close their eyes when so near this new world? No! All"
"x83","their feelings were concentrated in one single thought:—See!"
"x83","Representatives of the earth, of humanity, past and present, all"
"x83","centered in them! It is through their eyes that the human race look at"
"x83","these lunar regions, and penetrate the secrets of their satellite! A"
"x83","strange emotion filled their hearts as they went from one window to the"
"x83","other. Their observations, reproduced by Barbicane, were rigidly"
"x83","determined. To take them, they had glasses; to correct them, maps."
"x83",""
"x83","As regards the optical instruments at their disposal, they had"
"x83","excellent marine glasses specially constructed for this journey. They"
"x83","possessed magnifying powers of 100. They would thus have brought the"
"x83","moon to within a distance (apparent) of less than 2,000 leagues from"
"x83","the earth. But then, at a distance which for three hours in the morning"
"x83","did not exceed sixty-five miles, and in a medium free from all"
"x83","atmospheric disturbances, these instruments could reduce the lunar"
"x83","surface to within less than 1,500 yards!"

"x83","CHAPTER XI."
"x83","FANCY AND REALITY"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","“Have you ever seen the moon?” asked a professor, ironically, of one of"
"x83","his pupils."
"x83",""
"x83","“No, sir!” replied the pupil, still more ironically, “but I must say I"
"x83","have heard it spoken of.”"
"x83",""
"x83","In one sense, the pupil’s witty answer might be given by a large"
"x83","majority of sublunary beings. How many people have heard speak of the"
"x83","moon who have never seen it—at least through a glass or a telescope!"
"x83","How many have never examined the map of their satellite!"
"x83",""
"x83","In looking at a selenographic map, one peculiarity strikes us. Contrary"
"x83","to the arrangement followed for that of the Earth and Mars, the"
"x83","continents occupy more particularly the southern hemisphere of the"
"x83","lunar globe. These continents do not show such decided, clear, and"
"x83","regular boundary lines as South America, Africa, and the Indian"
"x83","peninsula. Their angular, capricious, and deeply indented coasts are"
"x83","rich in gulfs and peninsulas. They remind one of the confusion in the"
"x83","islands of the Sound, where the land is excessively indented. If"
"x83","navigation ever existed on the surface of the moon, it must have been"
"x83","wonderfully difficult and dangerous; and we may well pity the Selenite"
"x83","sailors and hydrographers; the former, when they came upon these"
"x83","perilous coasts, the latter when they took the soundings of its stormy"
"x83","banks."
"x83",""
"x83","We may also notice that, on the lunar sphere, the south pole is much"
"x83","more continental than the north pole. On the latter, there is but one"
"x83","slight strip of land separated from other continents by vast seas."
"x83","Toward the south, continents clothe almost the whole of the hemisphere."
"x83","It is even possible that the Selenites have already planted the flag on"
"x83","one of their poles, while Franklin, Ross, Kane, Dumont, d’Urville, and"
"x83","Lambert have never yet been able to attain that unknown point of the"
"x83","terrestrial globe."
"x83",""
"x83","As to islands, they are numerous on the surface of the moon. Nearly all"
"x83","oblong or circular, and as if traced with the compass, they seem to"
"x83","form one vast archipelago, equal to that charming group lying between"
"x83","Greece and Asia Minor, and which mythology in ancient times adorned"
"x83","with most graceful legends. Involuntarily the names of Naxos, Tenedos,"
"x83","and Carpathos, rise before the mind, and we seek vainly for Ulysses’"
"x83","vessel or the “clipper” of the Argonauts. So at least it was in Michel"
"x83","Ardan’s eyes. To him it was a Grecian archipelago that he saw on the"
"x83","map. To the eyes of his matter-of-fact companions, the aspect of these"
"x83","coasts recalled rather the parceled-out land of New Brunswick and Nova"
"x83","Scotia, and where the Frenchman discovered traces of the heroes of"
"x83","fable, these Americans were marking the most favorable points for the"
"x83","establishment of stores in the interests of lunar commerce and"
"x83","industry."
"x83",""
"x83","After wandering over these vast continents, the eye is attracted by the"
"x83","still greater seas. Not only their formation, but their situation and"
"x83","aspect remind one of the terrestrial oceans; but again, as on earth,"
"x83","these seas occupy the greater portion of the globe. But in point of"
"x83","fact, these are not liquid spaces, but plains, the nature of which the"
"x83","travelers hoped soon to determine. Astronomers, we must allow, have"
"x83","graced these pretended seas with at least odd names, which science has"
"x83","respected up to the present time. Michel Ardan was right when he"
"x83","compared this map to a “Tendre card,” got up by a Scudary or a Cyrano"
"x83","de Bergerac. “Only,” said he, “it is no longer the sentimental card of"
"x83","the seventeenth century, it is the card of life, very neatly divided"
"x83","into two parts, one feminine, the other masculine; the right hemisphere"
"x83","for woman, the left for man.”"
"x83",""
"x83","In speaking thus, Michel made his prosaic companions shrug their"
"x83","shoulders. Barbicane and Nicholl looked upon the lunar map from a very"
"x83","different point of view to that of their fantastic friend."
"x83","Nevertheless, their fantastic friend was a little in the right. Judge"
"x83","for yourselves."
"x83",""
"x83","In the left hemisphere stretches the “Sea of Clouds,” where human"
"x83","reason is so often shipwrecked. Not far off lies the “Sea of Rains,”"
"x83","fed by all the fever of existence. Near this is the “Sea of Storms,”"
"x83","where man is ever fighting against his passions, which too often gain"
"x83","the victory. Then, worn out by deceit, treasons, infidelity, and the"
"x83","whole body of terrestrial misery, what does he find at the end of his"
"x83","career? that vast “Sea of Humors,” barely softened by some drops of the"
"x83","waters from the “Gulf of Dew!” Clouds, rain, storms, and humors—does"
"x83","the life of man contain aught but these? and is it not summed up in"
"x83","these four words?"
"x83",""
"x83","The right hemisphere, “dedicated to the ladies,” encloses smaller seas,"
"x83","whose significant names contain every incident of a feminine existence."
"x83","There is the “Sea of Serenity,” over which the young girl bends; “The"
"x83","Lake of Dreams,” reflecting a joyous future; “The Sea of Nectar,” with"
"x83","its waves of tenderness and breezes of love; “The Sea of Fruitfulness;”"
"x83","“The Sea of Crises;” then the “Sea of Vapors,” whose dimensions are"
"x83","perhaps a little too confined; and lastly, that vast “Sea of"
"x83","Tranquillity,” in which every false passion, every useless dream, every"
"x83","unsatisfied desire is at length absorbed, and whose waves emerge"
"x83","peacefully into the “Lake of Death!”"
"x83",""
"x83","What a strange succession of names! What a singular division of the"
"x83","moon’s two hemispheres, joined to one another like man and woman, and"
"x83","forming that sphere of life carried into space! And was not the"
"x83","fantastic Michel right in thus interpreting the fancies of the ancient"
"x83","astronomers? But while his imagination thus roved over “the seas,” his"
"x83","grave companions were considering things more geographically. They were"
"x83","learning this new world by heart. They were measuring angles and"
"x83","diameters."

"x83","CHAPTER XII."
"x83","OROGRAPHIC DETAILS"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","The course taken by the projectile, as we have before remarked, was"
"x83","bearing it toward the moon’s northern hemisphere. The travelers were"
"x83","far from the central point which they would have struck, had their"
"x83","course not been subject to an irremediable deviation. It was past"
"x83","midnight; and Barbicane then estimated the distance at seven hundred"
"x83","and fifty miles, which was a little greater than the length of the"
"x83","lunar radius, and which would diminish as it advanced nearer to the"
"x83","North Pole. The projectile was then not at the altitude of the equator;"
"x83","but across the tenth parallel, and from that latitude, carefully taken"
"x83","on the map to the pole, Barbicane and his two companions were able to"
"x83","observe the moon under the most favorable conditions. Indeed, by means"
"x83","of glasses, the above-named distance was reduced to little more than"
"x83","fourteen miles. The telescope of the Rocky Mountains brought the moon"
"x83","much nearer; but the terrestrial atmosphere singularly lessened its"
"x83","power. Thus Barbicane, posted in his projectile, with the glasses to"
"x83","his eyes, could seize upon details which were almost imperceptible to"
"x83","earthly observers."
"x83",""
"x83","“My friends,” said the president, in a serious voice, “I do not know"
"x83","whither we are going; I do not know if we shall ever see the"
"x83","terrestrial globe again. Nevertheless, let us proceed as if our work"
"x83","would one day by useful to our fellow-men. Let us keep our minds free"
"x83","from every other consideration. We are astronomers; and this projectile"
"x83","is a room in the Cambridge University, carried into space. Let us make"
"x83","our observations!”"
"x83",""
"x83","This said, work was begun with great exactness; and they faithfully"
"x83","reproduced the different aspects of the moon, at the different"
"x83","distances which the projectile reached."
"x83",""
"x83","At the time that the projectile was as high as the tenth parallel,"
"x83","north latitude, it seemed rigidly to follow the twentieth degree, east"
"x83","longitude. We must here make one important remark with regard to the"
"x83","map by which they were taking observations. In the selenographical maps"
"x83","where, on account of the reversing of the objects by the glasses, the"
"x83","south is above and the north below, it would seem natural that, on"
"x83","account of that inversion, the east should be to the left hand, and the"
"x83","west to the right. But it is not so. If the map were turned upside"
"x83","down, showing the moon as we see her, the east would be to the left,"
"x83","and the west to the right, contrary to that which exists on terrestrial"
"x83","maps. The following is the reason of this anomaly. Observers in the"
"x83","northern hemisphere (say in Europe) see the moon in the south—according"
"x83","to them. When they take observations, they turn their backs to the"
"x83","north, the reverse position to that which they occupy when they study a"
"x83","terrestrial map. As they turn their backs to the north, the east is on"
"x83","their left, and the west to their right. To observers in the southern"
"x83","hemisphere (Patagonia for example), the moon’s west would be quite to"
"x83","their left, and the east to their right, as the south is behind them."
"x83","Such is the reason of the apparent reversing of these two cardinal"
"x83","points, and we must bear it in mind in order to be able to follow"
"x83","President Barbicane’s observations."
"x83",""
"x83","With the help of Boeer and Moedler’s _Mappa Selenographica_, the"
"x83","travelers were able at once to recognize that portion of the disc"
"x83","enclosed within the field of their glasses."
"x83",""
"x83","“What are we looking at, at this moment?” asked Michel."
"x83",""
"x83","“At the northern part of the ‘Sea of Clouds,’” answered Barbicane. “We"
"x83","are too far off to recognize its nature. Are these plains composed of"
"x83","arid sand, as the first astronomer maintained? Or are they nothing but"
"x83","immense forests, according to M. Warren de la Rue’s opinion, who gives"
"x83","the moon an atmosphere, though a very low and a very dense one? That we"
"x83","shall know by and by. We must affirm nothing until we are in a position"
"x83","to do so.”"
"x83",""
"x83","This “Sea of Clouds” is rather doubtfully marked out upon the maps. It"
"x83","is supposed that these vast plains are strewn with blocks of lava from"
"x83","the neighboring volcanoes on its right, Ptolemy, Purbach, Arzachel. But"
"x83","the projectile was advancing, and sensibly nearing it. Soon there"
"x83","appeared the heights which bound this sea at this northern limit."
"x83","Before them rose a mountain radiant with beauty, the top of which"
"x83","seemed lost in an eruption of solar rays."
"x83",""
"x83","“That is—?” asked Michel."
"x83",""
"x83","“Copernicus,” replied Barbicane."
"x83",""
"x83","“Let us see Copernicus.”"
"x83",""
"x83","This mount, situated in 9° north latitude and 20° east longitude, rose"
"x83","to a height of 10,600 feet above the surface of the moon. It is quite"
"x83","visible from the earth; and astronomers can study it with ease,"
"x83","particularly during the phase between the last quarter and the new"
"x83","moon, because then the shadows are thrown lengthways from east to west,"
"x83","allowing them to measure the heights."
"x83",""
"x83","This Copernicus forms the most important of the radiating system,"
"x83","situated in the southern hemisphere, according to Tycho Brahé. It rises"
"x83","isolated like a gigantic lighthouse on that portion of the “Sea of"
"x83","Clouds,” which is bounded by the “Sea of Tempests,” thus lighting by"
"x83","its splendid rays two oceans at a time. It was a sight without an"
"x83","equal, those long luminous trains, so dazzling in the full moon, and"
"x83","which, passing the boundary chain on the north, extends to the “Sea of"
"x83","Rains.” At one o’clock of the terrestrial morning, the projectile, like"
"x83","a balloon borne into space, overlooked the top of this superb mount."
"x83","Barbicane could recognize perfectly its chief features. Copernicus is"
"x83","comprised in the series of ringed mountains of the first order, in the"
"x83","division of great circles. Like Kepler and Aristarchus, which overlook"
"x83","the “Ocean of Tempests,” sometimes it appeared like a brilliant point"
"x83","through the cloudy light, and was taken for a volcano in activity. But"
"x83","it is only an extinct one—like all on that side of the moon. Its"
"x83","circumference showed a diameter of about twenty-two leagues. The"
"x83","glasses discovered traces of stratification produced by successive"
"x83","eruptions, and the neighborhood was strewn with volcanic remains which"
"x83","still choked some of the craters."
"x83",""
"x83","“There exist,” said Barbicane, “several kinds of circles on the surface"
"x83","of the moon, and it is easy to see that Copernicus belongs to the"
"x83","radiating class. If we were nearer, we should see the cones bristling"
"x83","on the inside, which in former times were so many fiery mouths. A"
"x83","curious arrangement, and one without an exception on the lunar disc, is"
"x83","that the interior surface of these circles is the reverse of the"
"x83","exterior, and contrary to the form taken by terrestrial craters. It"
"x83","follows, then, that the general curve of the bottom of these circles"
"x83","gives a sphere of a smaller diameter than that of the moon.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“And why this peculiar disposition?” asked Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","“We do not know,” replied Barbicane."
"x83",""
"x83","“What splendid radiation!” said Michel. “One could hardly see a finer"
"x83","spectacle, I think.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“What would you say, then,” replied Barbicane, “if chance should bear"
"x83","us toward the southern hemisphere?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Well, I should say that it was still more beautiful,” retorted Michel"
"x83","Ardan."
"x83",""
"x83","At this moment the projectile hung perpendicularly over the circle. The"
"x83","circumference of Copernicus formed almost a perfect circle, and its"
"x83","steep escarpments were clearly defined. They could even distinguish a"
"x83","second ringed enclosure. Around spread a grayish plain, of a wild"
"x83","aspect, on which every relief was marked in yellow. At the bottom of"
"x83","the circle, as if enclosed in a jewel case, sparkled for one instant"
"x83","two or three eruptive cones, like enormous dazzling gems. Toward the"
"x83","north the escarpments were lowered by a depression which would probably"
"x83","have given access to the interior of the crater."
"x83",""
"x83","In passing over the surrounding plains, Barbicane noticed a great"
"x83","number of less important mountains; and among others a little ringed"
"x83","one called Guy Lussac, the breadth of which measured twelve miles."
"x83",""
"x83","Toward the south, the plain was very flat, without one elevation,"
"x83","without one projection. Toward the north, on the contrary, till where"
"x83","it was bounded by the “Sea of Storms,” it resembled a liquid surface"
"x83","agitated by a storm, of which the hills and hollows formed a succession"
"x83","of waves suddenly congealed. Over the whole of this, and in all"
"x83","directions, lay the luminous lines, all converging to the summit of"
"x83","Copernicus."
"x83",""
"x83","The travelers discussed the origin of these strange rays; but they"
"x83","could not determine their nature any more than terrestrial observers."
"x83",""
"x83","“But why,” said Nicholl, “should not these rays be simply spurs of"
"x83","mountains which reflect more vividly the light of the sun?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“No,” replied Barbicane; “if it was so, under certain conditions of the"
"x83","moon, these ridges would cast shadows, and they do not cast any.”"
"x83",""
"x83","And indeed, these rays only appeared when the orb of day was in"
"x83","opposition to the moon, and disappeared as soon as its rays became"
"x83","oblique."
"x83",""
"x83","“But how have they endeavored to explain these lines of light?” asked"
"x83","Michel; “for I cannot believe that savants would ever be stranded for"
"x83","want of an explanation.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes,” replied Barbicane; “Herschel has put forward an opinion, but he"
"x83","did not venture to affirm it.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Never mind. What was the opinion?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“He thought that these rays might be streams of cooled lava which shone"
"x83","when the sun beat straight upon them. It may be so; but nothing can be"
"x83","less certain. Besides, if we pass nearer to Tycho, we shall be in a"
"x83","better position to find out the cause of this radiation.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Do you know, my friends, what that plain, seen from the height we are"
"x83","at, resembles?” said Michel."
"x83",""
"x83","“No,” replied Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","“Very well; with all those pieces of lava lengthened like rockets, it"
"x83","resembles an immense game of spelikans thrown pellmell. There wants but"
"x83","the hook to pull them out one by one.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Do be serious,” said Barbicane."
"x83",""
"x83","“Well, let us be serious,” replied Michel quietly; “and instead of"
"x83","spelikans, let us put bones. This plain, would then be nothing but an"
"x83","immense cemetery, on which would repose the mortal remains of thousands"
"x83","of extinct generations. Do you prefer that high-flown comparison?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“One is as good as the other,” retorted Barbicane."
"x83",""
"x83","“My word, you are difficult to please,” answered Michel."
"x83",""
"x83","“My worthy friend,” continued the matter-of-fact Barbicane, “it matters"
"x83","but little what it _resembles_, when we do not know what it _is_.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Well answered,” exclaimed Michel. “That will teach me to reason with"
"x83","savants.”"
"x83",""
"x83","But the projectile continued to advance with almost uniform speed"
"x83","around the lunar disc. The travelers, we may easily imagine, did not"
"x83","dream of taking a moment’s rest. Every minute changed the landscape"
"x83","which fled from beneath their gaze. About half past one o’clock in the"
"x83","morning, they caught a glimpse of the tops of another mountain."
"x83","Barbicane, consulting his map, recognized Eratosthenes."
"x83",""
"x83","It was a ringed mountain nine thousand feet high, and one of those"
"x83","circles so numerous on this satellite. With regard to this, Barbicane"
"x83","related Kepler’s singular opinion on the formation of circles."
"x83","According to that celebrated mathematician, these crater-like cavities"
"x83","had been dug by the hand of man."
"x83",""
"x83","“For what purpose?” asked Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","“For a very natural one,” replied Barbicane. “The Selenites might have"
"x83","undertaken these immense works and dug these enormous holes for a"
"x83","refuge and shield from the solar rays which beat upon them during"
"x83","fifteen consecutive days.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“The Selenites are not fools,” said Michel."
"x83",""
"x83","“A singular idea,” replied Nicholl; “but it is probable that Kepler did"
"x83","not know the true dimensions of these circles, for the digging of them"
"x83","would have been the work of giants quite impossible for the Selenites.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Why? if weight on the moon’s surface is six times less than on the"
"x83","earth?” said Michel."
"x83",""
"x83","“But if the Selenites are six times smaller?” retorted Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","“And if there are _no_ Selenites?” added Barbicane."
"x83",""
"x83","This put an end to the discussion."
"x83",""
"x83","Soon Eratosthenes disappeared under the horizon without the projectile"
"x83","being sufficiently near to allow close observation. This mountain"
"x83","separated the Apennines from the Carpathians. In the lunar orography"
"x83","they have discerned some chains of mountains, which are chiefly"
"x83","distributed over the northern hemisphere. Some, however, occupy certain"
"x83","portions of the southern hemisphere also."
"x83",""
"x83","About two o’clock in the morning Barbicane found that they were above"
"x83","the twentieth lunar parallel. The distance of the projectile from the"
"x83","moon was not more than six hundred miles. Barbicane, now perceiving"
"x83","that the projectile was steadily approaching the lunar disc, did not"
"x83","despair; if not of reaching her, at least of discovering the secrets of"
"x83","her configuration."
"x83",""
"x83",""

"x83",""
"x83","CHAPTER XIII."
"x83","LUNAR LANDSCAPES"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","At half-past two in the morning, the projectile was over the thirteenth"
"x83","lunar parallel and at the effective distance of five hundred miles,"
"x83","reduced by the glasses to five. It still seemed impossible, however,"
"x83","that it could ever touch any part of the disc. Its motive speed,"
"x83","comparatively so moderate, was inexplicable to President Barbicane. At"
"x83","that distance from the moon it must have been considerable, to enable"
"x83","it to bear up against her attraction. Here was a phenomenon the cause"
"x83","of which escaped them again. Besides, time failed them to investigate"
"x83","the cause. All lunar relief was defiling under the eyes of the"
"x83","travelers, and they would not lose a single detail."
"x83",""
"x83","Under the glasses the disc appeared at the distance of five miles. What"
"x83","would an aeronaut, borne to this distance from the earth, distinguish"
"x83","on its surface? We cannot say, since the greatest ascension has not"
"x83","been more than 25,000 feet."
"x83",""
"x83","This, however, is an exact description of what Barbicane and his"
"x83","companions saw at this height. Large patches of different colors"
"x83","appeared on the disc. Selenographers are not agreed upon the nature of"
"x83","these colors. There are several, and rather vividly marked. Julius"
"x83","Schmidt pretends that, if the terrestrial oceans were dried up, a"
"x83","Selenite observer could not distinguish on the globe a greater"
"x83","diversity of shades between the oceans and the continental plains than"
"x83","those on the moon present to a terrestrial observer. According to him,"
"x83","the color common to the vast plains known by the name of “seas” is a"
"x83","dark gray mixed with green and brown. Some of the large craters present"
"x83","the same appearance. Barbicane knew this opinion of the German"
"x83","selenographer, an opinion shared by Boeer and Moedler. Observation has"
"x83","proved that right was on their side, and not on that of some"
"x83","astronomers who admit the existence of only gray on the moon’s surface."
"x83","In some parts green was very distinct, such as springs, according to"
"x83","Julius Schmidt, from the seas of “Serenity and Humors.” Barbicane also"
"x83","noticed large craters, without any interior cones, which shed a bluish"
"x83","tint similar to the reflection of a sheet of steel freshly polished."
"x83","These colors belonged really to the lunar disc, and did not result, as"
"x83","some astronomers say, either from the imperfection in the objective of"
"x83","the glasses or from the interposition of the terrestrial atmosphere."
"x83",""
"x83","Not a doubt existed in Barbicane’s mind with regard to it, as he"
"x83","observed it through space, and so could not commit any optical error."
"x83","He considered the establishment of this fact as an acquisition to"
"x83","science. Now, were these shades of green, belonging to tropical"
"x83","vegetation, kept up by a low dense atmosphere? He could not yet say."
"x83",""
"x83","Farther on, he noticed a reddish tint, quite defined. The same shade"
"x83","had before been observed at the bottom of an isolated enclosure, known"
"x83","by the name of Lichtenburg’s circle, which is situated near the"
"x83","Hercynian mountains, on the borders of the moon; but they could not"
"x83","tell the nature of it."
"x83",""
"x83","They were not more fortunate with regard to another peculiarity of the"
"x83","disc, for they could not decide upon the cause of it."
"x83",""
"x83","Michel Ardan was watching near the president, when he noticed long"
"x83","white lines, vividly lighted up by the direct rays of the sun. It was a"
"x83","succession of luminous furrows, very different from the radiation of"
"x83","Copernicus not long before; they ran parallel with each other."
"x83",""
"x83","Michel, with his usual readiness, hastened to exclaim:"
"x83",""
"x83","“Look there! cultivated fields!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Cultivated fields!” replied Nicholl, shrugging his shoulders."
"x83",""
"x83","“Plowed, at all events,” retorted Michel Ardan; “but what laborers"
"x83","those Selenites must be, and what giant oxen they must harness to their"
"x83","plow to cut such furrows!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“They are not furrows,” said Barbicane; “they are _rifts_.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Rifts? stuff!” replied Michel mildly; “but what do you mean by ‘rifts’"
"x83","in the scientific world?”"
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane immediately enlightened his companion as to what he knew"
"x83","about lunar rifts. He knew that they were a kind of furrow found on"
"x83","every part of the disc which was not mountainous; that these furrows,"
"x83","generally isolated, measured from 400 to 500 leagues in length; that"
"x83","their breadth varied from 1,000 to 1,500 yards, and that their borders"
"x83","were strictly parallel; but he knew nothing more either of their"
"x83","formation or their nature."
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane, through his glasses, observed these rifts with great"
"x83","attention. He noticed that their borders were formed of steep"
"x83","declivities; they were long parallel ramparts, and with some small"
"x83","amount of imagination he might have admitted the existence of long"
"x83","lines of fortifications, raised by Selenite engineers. Of these"
"x83","different rifts some were perfectly straight, as if cut by a line;"
"x83","others were slightly curved, though still keeping their borders"
"x83","parallel; some crossed each other, some cut through craters; here they"
"x83","wound through ordinary cavities, such as Posidonius or Petavius; there"
"x83","they wound through the seas, such as the “Sea of Serenity.”"
"x83",""
"x83","These natural accidents naturally excited the imaginations of these"
"x83","terrestrial astronomers. The first observations had not discovered"
"x83","these rifts. Neither Hévelius, Cassin, La Hire, nor Herschel seemed to"
"x83","have known them. It was Schroeter who in 1789 first drew attention to"
"x83","them. Others followed who studied them, as Pastorff, Gruithuysen,"
"x83","Boeer, and Moedler. At this time their number amounts to seventy; but,"
"x83","if they have been counted, their nature has not yet been determined;"
"x83","they are certainly _not_ fortifications, any more than they are the"
"x83","ancient beds of dried-up rivers; for, on one side, the waters, so"
"x83","slight on the moon’s surface, could never have worn such drains for"
"x83","themselves; and, on the other, they often cross craters of great"
"x83","elevation."
"x83",""
"x83","We must, however, allow that Michel Ardan had “an idea,” and that,"
"x83","without knowing it, he coincided in that respect with Julius Schmidt."
"x83",""
"x83","“Why,” said he, “should not these unaccountable appearances be simply"
"x83","phenomena of vegetation?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“What do you mean?” asked Barbicane quickly."
"x83",""
"x83","“Do not excite yourself, my worthy president,” replied Michel; “might"
"x83","it not be possible that the dark lines forming that bastion were rows"
"x83","of trees regularly placed?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“You stick to your vegetation, then?” said Barbicane."
"x83",""
"x83","“I like,” retorted Michel Ardan, “to explain what you savants cannot"
"x83","explain; at least my hypotheses has the advantage of indicating why"
"x83","these rifts disappear, or seem to disappear, at certain seasons.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“And for what reason?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“For the reason that the trees become invisible when they lose their"
"x83","leaves, and visible again when they regain them.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Your explanation is ingenious, my dear companion,” replied Barbicane,"
"x83","“but inadmissible.”"

"x83","“Why?”"

"x83","“Because, so to speak, there are no seasons on the moon’s surface, and"
"x83","that, consequently, the phenomena of vegetation of which you speak"
"x83","cannot occur.”"
"x83",""
"x83","Indeed, the slight obliquity of the lunar axis keeps the sun at an"
"x83","almost equal height in every latitude. Above the equatorial regions the"
"x83","radiant orb almost invariably occupies the zenith, and does not pass"
"x83","the limits of the horizon in the polar regions; thus, according to each"
"x83","region, there reigns a perpetual winter, spring, summer, or autumn, as"
"x83","in the planet Jupiter, whose axis is but little inclined upon its"
"x83","orbit."
"x83",""
"x83","What origin do they attribute to these rifts? That is a question"
"x83","difficult to solve. They are certainly anterior to the formation of"
"x83","craters and circles, for several have introduced themselves by breaking"
"x83","through their circular ramparts. Thus it may be that, contemporary with"
"x83","the later geological epochs, they are due to the expansion of natural"
"x83","forces."
"x83",""
"x83","But the projectile had now attained the fortieth degree of lunar"
"x83","latitude, at a distance not exceeding 40 miles. Through the glasses"
"x83","objects appeared to be only four miles distant."
"x83",""
"x83","At this point, under their feet, rose Mount Helicon, 1,520 feet high,"
"x83","and round about the left rose moderate elevations, enclosing a small"
"x83","portion of the “Sea of Rains,” under the name of the Gulf of Iris. The"
"x83","terrestrial atmosphere would have to be one hundred and seventy times"
"x83","more transparent than it is, to allow astronomers to make perfect"
"x83","observations on the moon’s surface; but in the void in which the"
"x83","projectile floated no fluid interposed itself between the eye of the"
"x83","observer and the object observed. And more, Barbicane found himself"
"x83","carried to a greater distance than the most powerful telescopes had"
"x83","ever done before, either that of Lord Rosse or that of the Rocky"
"x83","Mountains. He was, therefore, under extremely favorable conditions for"
"x83","solving that great question of the habitability of the moon; but the"
"x83","solution still escaped him; he could distinguish nothing but desert"
"x83","beds, immense plains, and toward the north, arid mountains. Not a work"
"x83","betrayed the hand of man; not a ruin marked his course; not a group of"
"x83","animals was to be seen indicating life, even in an inferior degree. In"
"x83","no part was there life, in no part was there an appearance of"
"x83","vegetation. Of the three kingdoms which share the terrestrial globe"
"x83","between them, one alone was represented on the lunar and that the"
"x83","mineral."
"x83",""
"x83","“Ah, indeed!” said Michel Ardan, a little out of countenance; “then you"
"x83","see no one?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“No,” answered Nicholl; “up to this time, not a man, not an animal, not"
"x83","a tree! After all, whether the atmosphere has taken refuge at the"
"x83","bottom of cavities, in the midst of the circles, or even on the"
"x83","opposite face of the moon, we cannot decide.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Besides,” added Barbicane, “even to the most piercing eye a man cannot"
"x83","be distinguished farther than three and a half miles off; so that, if"
"x83","there are any Selenites, they can see our projectile, but we cannot see"
"x83","them.”"
"x83",""
"x83","Toward four in the morning, at the height of the fiftieth parallel, the"
"x83","distance was reduced to 300 miles. To the left ran a line of mountains"
"x83","capriciously shaped, lying in the full light. To the right, on the"
"x83","contrary, lay a black hollow resembling a vast well, unfathomable and"
"x83","gloomy, drilled into the lunar soil."
"x83",""
"x83","This hole was the “Black Lake”; it was Pluto, a deep circle which can"
"x83","be conveniently studied from the earth, between the last quarter and"
"x83","the new moon, when the shadows fall from west to east."
"x83",""
"x83","This black color is rarely met with on the surface of the satellite. As"
"x83","yet it has only been recognized in the depths of the circle of"
"x83","Endymion, to the east of the “Cold Sea,” in the northern hemisphere,"
"x83","and at the bottom of Grimaldi’s circle, on the equator, toward the"
"x83","eastern border of the orb."
"x83",""
"x83","Pluto is an annular mountain, situated in 51° north latitude, and 9°"
"x83","east longitude. Its circuit is forty-seven miles long and thirty-two"
"x83","broad."
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane regretted that they were not passing directly above this vast"
"x83","opening. There was an abyss to fathom, perhaps some mysterious"
"x83","phenomenon to surprise; but the projectile’s course could not be"
"x83","altered. They must rigidly submit. They could not guide a balloon,"
"x83","still less a projectile, when once enclosed within its walls. Toward"
"x83","five in the morning the northern limits of the “Sea of Rains” was at"
"x83","length passed. The mounts of Condamine and Fontenelle remained—one on"
"x83","the right, the other on the left. That part of the disc beginning with"
"x83","60° was becoming quite mountainous. The glasses brought them to within"
"x83","two miles, less than that separating the summit of Mont Blanc from the"
"x83","level of the sea. The whole region was bristling with spikes and"
"x83","circles. Toward the 60° Philolaus stood predominant at a height of"
"x83","5,550 feet with its elliptical crater, and seen from this distance, the"
"x83","disc showed a very fantastical appearance. Landscapes were presented to"
"x83","the eye under very different conditions from those on the earth, and"
"x83","also very inferior to them."
"x83",""
"x83","The moon having no atmosphere, the consequences arising from the"
"x83","absence of this gaseous envelope have already been shown. No twilight"
"x83","on her surface; night following day and day following night with the"
"x83","suddenness of a lamp which is extinguished or lighted amid profound"
"x83","darkness—no transition from cold to heat, the temperature falling in an"
"x83","instant from boiling point to the cold of space."
"x83",""
"x83","Another consequence of this want of air is that absolute darkness"
"x83","reigns where the sun’s rays do not penetrate. That which on earth is"
"x83","called diffusion of light, that luminous matter which the air holds in"
"x83","suspension, which creates the twilight and the daybreak, which produces"
"x83","the _umbrae_ and _penumbrae_, and all the magic of _chiaro-oscuro_,"
"x83","does not exist on the moon. Hence the harshness of contrasts, which"
"x83","only admit of two colors, black and white. If a Selenite were to shade"
"x83","his eyes from the sun’s rays, the sky would seem absolutely black, and"
"x83","the stars would shine to him as on the darkest night. Judge of the"
"x83","impression produced on Barbicane and his three friends by this strange"
"x83","scene! Their eyes were confused. They could no longer grasp the"
"x83","respective distances of the different plains. A lunar landscape without"
"x83","the softening of the phenomena of _chiaro-oscuro_ could not be rendered"
"x83","by an earthly landscape painter; it would be spots of ink on a white"
"x83","page—nothing more."
"x83",""
"x83","This aspect was not altered even when the projectile, at the height of"
"x83","80°, was only separated from the moon by a distance of fifty miles; nor"
"x83","even when, at five in the morning, it passed at less than twenty-five"
"x83","miles from the mountain of Gioja, a distance reduced by the glasses to"
"x83","a quarter of a mile. It seemed as if the moon might be touched by the"
"x83","hand! It seemed impossible that, before long, the projectile would not"
"x83","strike her, if only at the north pole, the brilliant arch of which was"
"x83","so distinctly visible on the black sky."
"x83",""
"x83","Michel Ardan wanted to open one of the scuttles and throw himself on to"
"x83","the moon’s surface! A very useless attempt; for if the projectile could"
"x83","not attain any point whatever of the satellite, Michel, carried along"
"x83","by its motion, could not attain it either."
"x83",""
"x83","At that moment, at six o’clock, the lunar pole appeared. The disc only"
"x83","presented to the travelers’ gaze one half brilliantly lit up, while the"
"x83","other disappeared in the darkness. Suddenly the projectile passed the"
"x83","line of demarcation between intense light and absolute darkness, and"
"x83","was plunged in profound night!"

"x83","CHAPTER XIV."
"x83","THE NIGHT OF THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY-FOUR HOURS AND A HALF"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","At the moment when this phenomenon took place so rapidly, the"
"x83","projectile was skirting the moon’s north pole at less than twenty-five"
"x83","miles distance. Some seconds had sufficed to plunge it into the"
"x83","absolute darkness of space. The transition was so sudden, without"
"x83","shade, without gradation of light, without attenuation of the luminous"
"x83","waves, that the orb seemed to have been extinguished by a powerful"
"x83","blow."
"x83",""
"x83","“Melted, disappeared!” Michel Ardan exclaimed, aghast."
"x83",""
"x83","Indeed, there was neither reflection nor shadow. Nothing more was to be"
"x83","seen of that disc, formerly so dazzling. The darkness was complete. and"
"x83","rendered even more so by the rays from the stars. It was “that"
"x83","blackness” in which the lunar nights are insteeped, which last three"
"x83","hundred and fifty-four hours and a half at each point of the disc, a"
"x83","long night resulting from the equality of the translatory and rotary"
"x83","movements of the moon. The projectile, immerged in the conical shadow"
"x83","of the satellite, experienced the action of the solar rays no more than"
"x83","any of its invisible points."
"x83",""
"x83","In the interior, the obscurity was complete. They could not see each"
"x83","other. Hence the necessity of dispelling the darkness. However desirous"
"x83","Barbicane might be to husband the gas, the reserve of which was small,"
"x83","he was obliged to ask from it a fictitious light, an expensive"
"x83","brilliancy which the sun then refused."
"x83",""
"x83","“Devil take the radiant orb!” exclaimed Michel Ardan, “which forces us"
"x83","to expend gas, instead of giving us his rays gratuitously.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Do not let us accuse the sun,” said Nicholl, “it is not his fault, but"
"x83","that of the moon, which has come and placed herself like a screen"
"x83","between us and it.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“It is the sun!” continued Michel."
"x83",""
"x83","“It is the moon!” retorted Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","An idle dispute, which Barbicane put an end to by saying:"
"x83",""
"x83","“My friends, it is neither the fault of the sun nor of the moon; it is"
"x83","the fault of the _projectile_, which, instead of rigidly following its"
"x83","course, has awkwardly missed it. To be more just, it is the fault of"
"x83","that unfortunate meteor which has so deplorably altered our first"
"x83","direction.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Well,” replied Michel Ardan, “as the matter is settled, let us have"
"x83","breakfast. After a whole night of watching it is fair to build"
"x83","ourselves up a little.”"
"x83",""
"x83","This proposal meeting with no contradiction, Michel prepared the repast"
"x83","in a few minutes. But they ate for eating’s sake, they drank without"
"x83","toasts, without hurrahs. The bold travelers being borne away into"
"x83","gloomy space, without their accustomed _cortege_ of rays, felt a vague"
"x83","uneasiness in their hearts. The “strange” shadow so dear to Victor"
"x83","Hugo’s pen bound them on all sides. But they talked over the"
"x83","interminable night of three hundred and fifty-four hours and a half,"
"x83","nearly fifteen days, which the law of physics has imposed on the"
"x83","inhabitants of the moon."
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane gave his friends some explanation of the causes and the"
"x83","consequences of this curious phenomenon."
"x83",""
"x83","“Curious indeed,” said they; “for, if each hemisphere of the moon is"
"x83","deprived of solar light for fifteen days, that above which we now float"
"x83","does not even enjoy during its long night any view of the earth so"
"x83","beautifully lit up. In a word she has no moon (applying this"
"x83","designation to our globe) but on one side of her disc. Now if this were"
"x83","the case with the earth—if, for example, Europe never saw the moon, and"
"x83","she was only visible at the antipodes, imagine to yourself the"
"x83","astonishment of a European on arriving in Australia.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“They would make the voyage for nothing but to see the moon!” replied"
"x83","Michel."
"x83",""
"x83","“Very well!” continued Barbicane, “that astonishment is reserved for"
"x83","the Selenites who inhabit the face of the moon opposite to the earth, a"
"x83","face which is ever invisible to our countrymen of the terrestrial"
"x83","globe.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“And which we should have seen,” added Nicholl, “if we had arrived here"
"x83","when the moon was new, that is to say fifteen days later.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“I will add, to make amends,” continued Barbicane, “that the"
"x83","inhabitants of the visible face are singularly favored by nature, to"
"x83","the detriment of their brethren on the invisible face. The latter, as"
"x83","you see, have dark nights of 354 hours, without one single ray to break"
"x83","the darkness. The other, on the contrary, when the sun which has given"
"x83","its light for fifteen days sinks below the horizon, see a splendid orb"
"x83","rise on the opposite horizon. It is the earth, which is thirteen times"
"x83","greater than the diminutive moon that we know—the earth which developes"
"x83","itself at a diameter of two degrees, and which sheds a light thirteen"
"x83","times greater than that qualified by atmospheric strata—the earth which"
"x83","only disappears at the moment when the sun reappears in its turn!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Nicely worded!” said Michel, “slightly academical perhaps.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“It follows, then,” continued Barbicane, without knitting his brows,"
"x83","“that the visible face of the disc must be very agreeable to inhabit,"
"x83","since it always looks on either the sun when the moon is full, or on"
"x83","the earth when the moon is new.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“But,” said Nicholl, “that advantage must be well compensated by the"
"x83","insupportable heat which the light brings with it.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“The inconvenience, in that respect, is the same for the two faces, for"
"x83","the earth’s light is evidently deprived of heat. But the invisible face"
"x83","is still more searched by the heat than the visible face. I say that"
"x83","for _you_, Nicholl, because Michel will probably not understand.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Thank you,” said Michel."
"x83",""
"x83","“Indeed,” continued Barbicane, “when the invisible face receives at the"
"x83","same time light and heat from the sun, it is because the moon is new;"
"x83","that is to say, she is situated between the sun and the earth. It"
"x83","follows, then, considering the position which she occupies in"
"x83","opposition when full, that she is nearer to the sun by twice her"
"x83","distance from the earth; and that distance may be estimated at the"
"x83","two-hundredth part of that which separates the sun from the earth, or"
"x83","in round numbers 400,000 miles. So that invisible face is so much"
"x83","nearer to the sun when she receives its rays.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Quite right,” replied Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","“On the contrary,” continued Barbicane."
"x83",""
"x83","“One moment,” said Michel, interrupting his grave companion."
"x83",""
"x83","“What do you want?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“I ask to be allowed to continue the explanation.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“And why?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“To prove that I understand.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Get along with you,” said Barbicane, smiling."
"x83",""
"x83","“On the contrary,” said Michel, imitating the tone and gestures of the"
"x83","president, “on the contrary, when the visible face of the moon is lit"
"x83","by the sun, it is because the moon is full, that is to say, opposite"
"x83","the sun with regard to the earth. The distance separating it from the"
"x83","radiant orb is then increased in round numbers to 400,000 miles, and"
"x83","the heat which she receives must be a little less.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Very well said!” exclaimed Barbicane. “Do you know, Michel, that, for"
"x83","an amateur, you are intelligent.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes,” replied Michel coolly, “we are all so on the Boulevard des"
"x83","Italiens.”"
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane gravely grasped the hand of his amiable companion, and"
"x83","continued to enumerate the advantages reserved for the inhabitants of"
"x83","the visible face."
"x83",""
"x83","Among others, he mentioned eclipses of the sun, which only take place"
"x83","on this side of the lunar disc; since, in order that they may take"
"x83","place, it is necessary for the moon to be _in opposition_. These"
"x83","eclipses, caused by the interposition of the earth between the moon and"
"x83","the sun, can last _two hours_; during which time, by reason of the rays"
"x83","refracted by its atmosphere, the terrestrial globe can appear as"
"x83","nothing but a black point upon the sun."
"x83",""
"x83","“So,” said Nicholl, “there is a hemisphere, that invisible hemisphere"
"x83","which is very ill supplied, very ill treated, by nature.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Never mind,” replied Michel; “if we ever become Selenites, we will"
"x83","inhabit the visible face. I like the light.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Unless, by any chance,” answered Nicholl, “the atmosphere should be"
"x83","condensed on the other side, as certain astronomers pretend.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“That would be a consideration,” said Michel."
"x83",""
"x83","Breakfast over, the observers returned to their post. They tried to see"
"x83","through the darkened scuttles by extinguishing all light in the"
"x83","projectile; but not a luminous spark made its way through the darkness."
"x83",""
"x83","One inexplicable fact preoccupied Barbicane. Why, having passed within"
"x83","such a short distance of the moon—about twenty-five miles only—why the"
"x83","projectile had not fallen? If its speed had been enormous, he could"
"x83","have understood that the fall would not have taken place; but, with a"
"x83","relatively moderate speed, that resistance to the moon’s attraction"
"x83","could not be explained. Was the projectile under some foreign"
"x83","influence? Did some kind of body retain it in the ether? It was quite"
"x83","evident that it could never reach any point of the moon. Whither was it"
"x83","going? Was it going farther from, or nearing, the disc? Was it being"
"x83","borne in that profound darkness through the infinity of space? How"
"x83","could they learn, how calculate, in the midst of this night? All these"
"x83","questions made Barbicane uneasy, but he could not solve them."
"x83",""
"x83","Certainly, the invisible orb was _there_, perhaps only some few miles"
"x83","off; but neither he nor his companions could see it. If there was any"
"x83","noise on its surface, they could not hear it. Air, that medium of"
"x83","sound, was wanting to transmit the groanings of that moon which the"
"x83","Arabic legends call “a man already half granite, and still breathing.”"
"x83",""
"x83","One must allow that that was enough to aggravate the most patient"
"x83","observers. It was just that unknown hemisphere which was stealing from"
"x83","their sight. That face which fifteen days sooner, or fifteen days"
"x83","later, had been, or would be, splendidly illuminated by the solar rays,"
"x83","was then being lost in utter darkness. In fifteen days where would the"
"x83","projectile be? Who could say? Where would the chances of conflicting"
"x83","attractions have drawn it to? The disappointment of the travelers in"
"x83","the midst of this utter darkness may be imagined. All observation of"
"x83","the lunar disc was impossible. The constellations alone claimed all"
"x83","their attention; and we must allow that the astronomers Faye,"
"x83","Charconac, and Secchi, never found themselves in circumstances so"
"x83","favorable for their observation."
"x83",""
"x83","Indeed, nothing could equal the splendor of this starry world, bathed"
"x83","in limpid ether. Its diamonds set in the heavenly vault sparkled"
"x83","magnificently. The eye took in the firmament from the Southern Cross to"
"x83","the North Star, those two constellations which in 12,000 years, by"
"x83","reason of the succession of equinoxes, will resign their part of the"
"x83","polar stars, the one to Canopus in the southern hemisphere, the other"
"x83","to Wega in the northern. Imagination loses itself in this sublime"
"x83","Infinity, amid which the projectile was gravitating, like a new star"
"x83","created by the hand of man. From a natural cause, these constellations"
"x83","shone with a soft luster; they did not twinkle, for there was no"
"x83","atmosphere which, by the intervention of its layers unequally dense and"
"x83","of different degrees of humidity, produces this scintillation. These"
"x83","stars were soft eyes, looking out into the dark night, amid the silence"
"x83","of absolute space."
"x83",""
"x83","Long did the travelers stand mute, watching the constellated firmament,"
"x83","upon which the moon, like a vast screen, made an enormous black hole."
"x83","But at length a painful sensation drew them from their watchings. This"
"x83","was an intense cold, which soon covered the inside of the glass of the"
"x83","scuttles with a thick coating of ice. The sun was no longer warming the"
"x83","projectile with its direct rays, and thus it was losing the heat stored"
"x83","up in its walls by degrees. This heat was rapidly evaporating into"
"x83","space by radiation, and a considerably lower temperature was the"
"x83","result. The humidity of the interior was changed into ice upon contact"
"x83","with the glass, preventing all observation."
"x83",""
"x83","Nicholl consulted the thermometer, and saw that it had fallen to"
"x83","seventeen degrees (Centigrade) below zero.[3] So that, in spite of the"
"x83","many reasons for economizing, Barbicane, after having begged light from"
"x83","the gas, was also obliged to beg for heat. The projectile’s low"
"x83","temperature was no longer endurable. Its tenants would have been frozen"
"x83","to death."
"x83",""
"x83"," [3] 1° Fahrenheit."
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","“Well!” observed Michel, “we cannot reasonably complain of the monotony"
"x83","of our journey! What variety we have had, at least in temperature. Now"
"x83","we are blinded with light and saturated with heat, like the Indians of"
"x83","the Pampas! now plunged into profound darkness, amid the cold, like the"
"x83","Esquimaux of the north pole. No, indeed! we have no right to complain;"
"x83","nature does wonders in our honor.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“But,” asked Nicholl, “what is the temperature outside?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Exactly that of the planetary space,” replied Barbicane."
"x83",""
"x83","“Then,” continued Michel Ardan, “would not this be the time to make the"
"x83","experiment which we dared not attempt when we were drowned in the sun’s"
"x83","rays?"
"x83",""
"x83","“It is now or never,” replied Barbicane, “for we are in a good position"
"x83","to verify the temperature of space, and see if Fourier or Pouillet’s"
"x83","calculations are exact.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“In any case it is cold,” said Michel. “See! the steam of the interior"
"x83","is condensing on the glasses of the scuttles. If the fall continues,"
"x83","the vapor of our breath will fall in snow around us.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Let us prepare a thermometer,” said Barbicane."
"x83",""
"x83","We may imagine that an ordinary thermometer would afford no result"
"x83","under the circumstances in which this instrument was to be exposed. The"
"x83","mercury would have been frozen in its ball, as below 42° Fahrenheit"
"x83","below zero it is no longer liquid. But Barbicane had furnished himself"
"x83","with a spirit thermometer on Wafferdin’s system, which gives the minima"
"x83","of excessively low temperatures."
"x83",""
"x83","Before beginning the experiment, this instrument was compared with an"
"x83","ordinary one, and then Barbicane prepared to use it."
"x83",""
"x83","“How shall we set about it?” asked Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","“Nothing is easier,” replied Michel Ardan, who was never at a loss. “We"
"x83","open the scuttle rapidly; throw out the instrument; it follows the"
"x83","projectile with exemplary docility; and a quarter of an hour after,"
"x83","draw it in.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“With the hand?” asked Barbicane."
"x83",""
"x83","“With the hand,” replied Michel."
"x83",""
"x83","“Well, then, my friend, do not expose yourself,” answered Barbicane,"
"x83","“for the hand that you draw in again will be nothing but a stump frozen"

"x83",""
"x83","“Really!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“You will feel as if you had had a terrible burn, like that of iron at"

"x83","that the objects we have thrown out are still following us.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Why not?” asked Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","“Because, if we are passing through an atmosphere of the slightest"
"x83","density, these objects will be retarded. Again, the darkness prevents"
"x83","our seeing if they still float around us. But in order not to expose"
"x83","ourselves to the loss of our thermometer, we will fasten it, and we can"
"x83","then more easily pull it back again.”"
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane’s advice was followed. Through the scuttle rapidly opened,"
"x83","Nicholl threw out the instrument, which was held by a short cord, so"
"x83","that it might be more easily drawn up. The scuttle had not been opened"
"x83","more than a second, but that second had sufficed to let in a most"
"x83","intense cold."
"x83",""
"x83","“The devil!” exclaimed Michel Ardan, “it is cold enough to freeze a"
"x83","white bear.”"
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane waited until half an hour had elapsed, which was more than"
"x83","time enough to allow the instrument to fall to the level of the"
"x83","surrounding temperature. Then it was rapidly pulled in."
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane calculated the quantity of spirits of wine overflowed into"
"x83","the little vial soldered to the lower part of the instrument, and said:"
"x83",""
"x83","“A hundred and forty degrees Centigrade[4] below zero!”"
"x83",""
"x83"," [4] 218 degrees Fahrenheit below zero."

"x83","M. Pouillet was right and Fourier wrong. That was the undoubted"

"x83","which fifteen days of sun have poured into her."

"x83","CHAPTER XV."
"x83","HYPERBOLA OR PARABOLA"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","We may, perhaps, be astonished to find Barbicane and his companions so"
"x83","little occupied with the future reserved for them in their metal prison"
"x83","which was bearing them through the infinity of space. Instead of asking"
"x83","where they were going, they passed their time making experiments, as if"
"x83","they had been quietly installed in their own study."
"x83",""
"x83","We might answer that men so strong-minded were above such"
"x83","anxieties—that they did not trouble themselves about such trifles—and"
"x83","that they had something else to do than to occupy their minds with the"
"x83","future."
"x83",""
"x83","The truth was that they were not masters of their projectile; they"
"x83","could neither check its course, nor alter its direction."
"x83",""
"x83","A sailor can change the head of his ship as he pleases; an aeronaut can"
"x83","give a vertical motion to his balloon. They, on the contrary, had no"
"x83","power over their vehicle. Every maneuver was forbidden. Hence the"
"x83","inclination to let things alone, or as the sailors say, “let her run.”"
"x83",""
"x83","Where did they find themselves at this moment, at eight o’clock in the"
"x83","morning of the day called upon the earth the 6th of December? Very"
"x83","certainly in the neighborhood of the moon, and even near enough for her"
"x83","to look to them like an enormous black screen upon the firmament. As to"
"x83","the distance which separated them, it was impossible to estimate it."
"x83","The projectile, held by some unaccountable force, had been within four"
"x83","miles of grazing the satellite’s north pole."
"x83",""
"x83","But since entering the cone of shadow these last two hours, had the"
"x83","distance increased or diminished? Every point of mark was wanting by"
"x83","which to estimate both the direction and the speed of the projectile."
"x83",""
"x83","Perhaps it was rapidly leaving the disc, so that it would soon quit the"
"x83","pure shadow. Perhaps, again, on the other hand, it might be nearing it"
"x83","so much that in a short time it might strike some high point on the"
"x83","invisible hemisphere, which would doubtlessly have ended the journey"
"x83","much to the detriment of the travelers."
"x83",""
"x83","A discussion arose on this subject, and Michel Ardan, always ready with"
"x83","an explanation, gave it as his opinion that the projectile, held by the"
"x83","lunar attraction, would end by falling on the surface of the"
"x83","terrestrial globe like an aerolite."
"x83",""
"x83","“First of all, my friend,” answered Barbicane, “every aerolite does not"
"x83","fall to the earth; it is only a small proportion which do so; and if we"
"x83","had passed into an aerolite, it does not necessarily follow that we"
"x83","should ever reach the surface of the moon.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“But how if we get near enough?” replied Michel."
"x83",""
"x83","“Pure mistake,” replied Barbicane. “Have you not seen shooting stars"
"x83","rush through the sky by thousands at certain seasons?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Well, these stars, or rather corpuscles, only shine when they are"
"x83","heated by gliding over the atmospheric layers. Now, if they enter the"
"x83","atmosphere, they pass at least within forty miles of the earth, but"
"x83","they seldom fall upon it. The same with our projectile. It may approach"
"x83","very near to the moon, and not yet fall upon it.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“But then,” asked Michel, “I shall be curious to know how our erring"
"x83","vehicle will act in space?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“I see but two hypotheses,” replied Barbicane, after some moments’"
"x83","reflection."
"x83",""
"x83","“What are they?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“The projectile has the choice between two mathematical curves, and it"
"x83","will follow one or the other according to the speed with which it is"
"x83","animated, and which at this moment I cannot estimate.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes,” said Nicholl, “it will follow either a parabola or a hyperbola.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Just so,” replied Barbicane. “With a certain speed it will assume the"
"x83","parabola, and with a greater the hyperbola.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“I like those grand words,” exclaimed Michel Ardan; “one knows directly"
"x83","what they mean. And pray what is your parabola, if you please?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“My friend,” answered the captain, “the parabola is a curve of the"
"x83","second order, the result of the section of a cone intersected by a"
"x83","plane parallel to one of the sides.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Ah! ah!” said Michel, in a satisfied tone."
"x83",""
"x83","“It is very nearly,” continued Nicholl, “the course described by a bomb"
"x83","launched from a mortar.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Perfect! And the hyperbola?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“The hyperbola, Michel, is a curve of the second order, produced by the"
"x83","intersection of a conic surface and a plane parallel to its axis, and"
"x83","constitutes two branches separated one from the other, both tending"
"x83","indefinitely in the two directions.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Is it possible!” exclaimed Michel Ardan in a serious tone, as if they"
"x83","had told him of some serious event. “What I particularly like in your"
"x83","definition of the hyperbola (I was going to say hyperblague) is that it"
"x83","is still more obscure than the word you pretend to define.”"
"x83",""
"x83","Nicholl and Barbicane cared little for Michel Ardan’s fun. They were"
"x83","deep in a scientific discussion. What curve would the projectile"
"x83","follow? was their hobby. One maintained the hyperbola, the other the"
"x83","parabola. They gave each other reasons bristling with _x_. Their"
"x83","arguments were couched in language which made Michel jump. The"
"x83","discussion was hot, and neither would give up his chosen curve to his"
"x83","adversary."
"x83",""
"x83","This scientific dispute lasted so long that it made Michel very"
"x83","impatient."
"x83",""
"x83","“Now, gentlemen cosines, will you cease to throw parabolas and"
"x83","hyperbolas at each other’s heads? I want to understand the only"
"x83","interesting question in the whole affair. We shall follow one or the"
"x83","other of these curves? Good. But where will they lead us to?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Nowhere,” replied Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","“How, nowhere?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Evidently,” said Barbicane, “they are open curves, which may be"
"x83","prolonged indefinitely.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Ah, savants!” cried Michel; “and what are either the one or the other"
"x83","to us from the moment we know that they equally lead us into infinite"
"x83","space?”"
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane and Nicholl could not forbear smiling. They had just been"
"x83","creating “art for art’s sake.” Never had so idle a question been raised"
"x83","at such an inopportune moment. The sinister truth remained that,"
"x83","whether hyperbolically or parabolically borne away, the projectile"
"x83","would never again meet either the earth or the moon."
"x83",""
"x83","What would become of these bold travelers in the immediate future? If"
"x83","they did not die of hunger, if they did not die of thirst, in some"
"x83","days, when the gas failed, they would die from want of air, unless the"
"x83","cold had killed them first. Still, important as it was to economize the"
"x83","gas, the excessive lowness of the surrounding temperature obliged them"
"x83","to consume a certain quantity. Strictly speaking, they could do without"
"x83","its _light_, but not without its _heat_. Fortunately the caloric"
"x83","generated by Reiset’s and Regnaut’s apparatus raised the temperature of"
"x83","the interior of the projectile a little, and without much expenditure"
"x83","they were able to keep it bearable."
"x83",""
"x83","But observations had now become very difficult. the dampness of the"
"x83","projectile was condensed on the windows and congealed immediately. This"
"x83","cloudiness had to be dispersed continually. In any case they might hope"
"x83","to be able to discover some phenomena of the highest interest."
"x83",""
"x83","But up to this time the disc remained dumb and dark. It did not answer"
"x83","the multiplicity of questions put by these ardent minds; a matter which"
"x83","drew this reflection from Michel, apparently a just one:"
"x83",""
"x83","“If ever we begin this journey over again, we shall do well to choose"
"x83","the time when the moon is at the full.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Certainly,” said Nicholl, “that circumstance will be more favorable. I"
"x83","allow that the moon, immersed in the sun’s rays, will not be visible"
"x83","during the transit, but instead we should see the earth, which would be"
"x83","full. And what is more, if we were drawn round the moon, as at this"
"x83","moment, we should at least have the advantage of seeing the invisible"
"x83","part of her disc magnificently lit.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Well said, Nicholl,” replied Michel Ardan. “What do you think,"
"x83","Barbicane?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“I think this,” answered the grave president: “If ever we begin this"
"x83","journey again, we shall start at the same time and under the same"
"x83","conditions. Suppose we had attained our end, would it not have been"
"x83","better to have found continents in broad daylight than a country"
"x83","plunged in utter darkness? Would not our first installation have been"
"x83","made under better circumstances? Yes, evidently. As to the invisible"
"x83","side, we could have visited it in our exploring expeditions on the"
"x83","lunar globe. So that the time of the full moon was well chosen. But we"
"x83","ought to have arrived at the end; and in order to have so arrived, we"
"x83","ought to have suffered no deviation on the road.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“I have nothing to say to that,” answered Michel Ardan. “Here is,"
"x83","however, a good opportunity lost of observing the other side of the"
"x83","moon.”"
"x83",""
"x83","But the projectile was now describing in the shadow that incalculable"
"x83","course which no sight-mark would allow them to ascertain. Had its"
"x83","direction been altered, either by the influence of the lunar"
"x83","attraction, or by the action of some unknown star? Barbicane could not"
"x83","say. But a change had taken place in the relative position of the"
"x83","vehicle; and Barbicane verified it about four in the morning."
"x83",""
"x83","The change consisted in this, that the base of the projectile had"
"x83","turned toward the moon’s surface, and was so held by a perpendicular"
"x83","passing through its axis. The attraction, that is to say the weight,"
"x83","had brought about this alteration. The heaviest part of the projectile"
"x83","inclined toward the invisible disc as if it would fall upon it."
"x83",""
"x83","Was it falling? Were the travelers attaining that much desired end? No."
"x83","And the observation of a sign-point, quite inexplicable in itself,"
"x83","showed Barbicane that his projectile was not nearing the moon, and that"
"x83","it had shifted by following an almost concentric curve."
"x83",""
"x83","This point of mark was a luminous brightness, which Nicholl sighted"
"x83","suddenly, on the limit of the horizon formed by the black disc. This"
"x83","point could not be confounded with a star. It was a reddish"
"x83","incandescence which increased by degrees, a decided proof that the"
"x83","projectile was shifting toward it and not falling normally on the"
"x83","surface of the moon."
"x83",""
"x83","“A volcano! it is a volcano in action!” cried Nicholl; “a disemboweling"
"x83","of the interior fires of the moon! That world is not quite"
"x83","extinguished.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes, an eruption,” replied Barbicane, who was carefully studying the"
"x83","phenomenon through his night glass. “What should it be, if not a"
"x83","volcano?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“But, then,” said Michel Ardan, “in order to maintain that combustion,"
"x83","there must be air. So the atmosphere does surround that part of the"
"x83","moon.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Perhaps so,” replied Barbicane, “but not necessarily."
"x83",""
"x83","The volcano, by the decomposition of certain substances, can provide"
"x83","its own oxygen, and thus throw flames into space. It seems to me that"
"x83","the deflagration, by the intense brilliancy of the substances in"
"x83","combustion, is produced in pure oxygen. We must not be in a hurry to"
"x83","proclaim the existence of a lunar atmosphere.”"
"x83",""
"x83","The fiery mountain must have been situated about the 45° south latitude"
"x83","on the invisible part of the disc; but, to Barbicane’s great"
"x83","displeasure, the curve which the projectile was describing was taking"
"x83","it far from the point indicated by the eruption. Thus he could not"
"x83","determine its nature exactly. Half an hour after being sighted, this"
"x83","luminous point had disappeared behind the dark horizon; but the"
"x83","verification of this phenomenon was of considerable consequence in"
"x83","their selenographic studies. It proved that all heat had not yet"
"x83","disappeared from the bowels of this globe; and where heat exists, who"
"x83","can affirm that the vegetable kingdom, nay, even the animal kingdom"
"x83","itself, has not up to this time resisted all destructive influences?"
"x83","The existence of this volcano in eruption, unmistakably seen by these"
"x83","earthly savants, would doubtless give rise to many theories favorable"
"x83","to the grave question of the habitability of the moon."
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane allowed himself to be carried away by these reflections. He"
"x83","forgot himself in a deep reverie in which the mysterious destiny of the"
"x83","lunar world was uppermost. He was seeking to combine together the facts"
"x83","observed up to that time, when a new incident recalled him briskly to"
"x83","reality. This incident was more than a cosmical phenomenon; it was a"
"x83","threatened danger, the consequence of which might be disastrous in the"
"x83","extreme."
"x83",""
"x83","Suddenly, in the midst of the ether, in the profound darkness, an"
"x83","enormous mass appeared. It was like a moon, but an incandescent moon"
"x83","whose brilliancy was all the more intolerable as it cut sharply on the"
"x83","frightful darkness of space. This mass, of a circular form, threw a"
"x83","light which filled the projectile. The forms of Barbicane, Nicholl, and"
"x83","Michel Ardan, bathed in its white sheets, assumed that livid spectral"
"x83","appearance which physicians produce with the fictitious light of"
"x83","alcohol impregnated with salt."
"x83",""
"x83","“By Jove!” cried Michel Ardan, “we are hideous. What is that"
"x83","ill-conditioned moon?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“A meteor,” replied Barbicane."
"x83",""
"x83","“A meteor burning in space?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes.”"
"x83",""
"x83","This shooting globe suddenly appearing in shadow at a distance of at"
"x83","most 200 miles, ought, according to Barbicane, to have a diameter of"
"x83","2,000 yards. It advanced at a speed of about one mile and a half per"
"x83","second. It cut the projectile’s path and must reach it in some minutes."
"x83","As it approached it grew to enormous proportions."
"x83",""
"x83","Imagine, if possible, the situation of the travelers! It is impossible"
"x83","to describe it. In spite of their courage, their _sang-froid_, their"
"x83","carelessness of danger, they were mute, motionless with stiffened"
"x83","limbs, a prey to frightful terror. Their projectile, the course of"
"x83","which they could not alter, was rushing straight on this ignited mass,"
"x83","more intense than the open mouth of an oven. It seemed as though they"
"x83","were being precipitated toward an abyss of fire."
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane had seized the hands of his two companions, and all three"
"x83","looked through their half-open eyelids upon that asteroid heated to a"
"x83","white heat. If thought was not destroyed within them, if their brains"
"x83","still worked amid all this awe, they must have given themselves up for"
"x83","lost."
"x83",""
"x83","Two minutes after the sudden appearance of the meteor (to them two"
"x83","centuries of anguish) the projectile seemed almost about to strike it,"
"x83","when the globe of fire burst like a bomb, but without making any noise"
"x83","in that void where sound, which is but the agitation of the layers of"
"x83","air, could not be generated."
"x83",""
"x83","Nicholl uttered a cry, and he and his companions rushed to the scuttle."
"x83","What a sight! What pen can describe it? What palette is rich enough in"
"x83","colors to reproduce so magnificent a spectacle?"
"x83",""
"x83","It was like the opening of a crater, like the scattering of an immense"
"x83","conflagration. Thousands of luminous fragments lit up and irradiated"
"x83","space with their fires. Every size, every color, was there"
"x83","intermingled. There were rays of yellow and pale yellow, red, green,"
"x83","gray—a crown of fireworks of all colors. Of the enormous and"
"x83","much-dreaded globe there remained nothing but these fragments carried"
"x83","in all directions, now become asteroids in their turn, some flaming"
"x83","like a sword, some surrounded by a whitish cloud, and others leaving"
"x83","behind them trains of brilliant cosmical dust."
"x83",""
"x83","These incandescent blocks crossed and struck each other, scattering"
"x83","still smaller fragments, some of which struck the projectile. Its left"
"x83","scuttle was even cracked by a violent shock. It seemed to be floating"
"x83","amid a hail of howitzer shells, the smallest of which might destroy it"
"x83","instantly."
"x83",""
"x83","The light which saturated the ether was so wonderfully intense, that"
"x83","Michel, drawing Barbicane and Nicholl to his window, exclaimed, “The"
"x83","invisible moon, visible at last!”"
"x83",""
"x83","And through a luminous emanation, which lasted some seconds, the whole"
"x83","three caught a glimpse of that mysterious disc which the eye of man now"
"x83","saw for the first time. What could they distinguish at a distance which"
"x83","they could not estimate? Some lengthened bands along the disc, real"
"x83","clouds formed in the midst of a very confined atmosphere, from which"
"x83","emerged not only all the mountains, but also projections of less"
"x83","importance; its circles, its yawning craters, as capriciously placed as"
"x83","on the visible surface. Then immense spaces, no longer arid plains, but"
"x83","real seas, oceans, widely distributed, reflecting on their liquid"
"x83","surface all the dazzling magic of the fires of space; and, lastly, on"
"x83","the surface of the continents, large dark masses, looking like immense"
"x83","forests under the rapid illumination of a brilliance."
"x83",""
"x83","Was it an illusion, a mistake, an optical illusion? Could they give a"
"x83","scientific assent to an observation so superficially obtained? Dared"
"x83","they pronounce upon the question of its habitability after so slight a"
"x83","glimpse of the invisible disc?"
"x83",""
"x83","But the lightnings in space subsided by degrees; its accidental"
"x83","brilliancy died away; the asteroids dispersed in different directions"
"x83","and were extinguished in the distance."
"x83",""
"x83","The ether returned to its accustomed darkness; the stars, eclipsed for"

"x83","CHAPTER XVI."
"x83","THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","The projectile had just escaped a terrible danger, and a very unforseen"
"x83","one. Who would have thought of such an encounter with meteors? These"
"x83","erring bodies might create serious perils for the travelers. They were"
"x83","to them so many sandbanks upon that sea of ether which, less fortunate"
"x83","than sailors, they could not escape. But did these adventurers complain"
"x83","of space? No, not since nature had given them the splendid sight of a"
"x83","cosmical meteor bursting from expansion, since this inimitable"
"x83","firework, which no Ruggieri could imitate, had lit up for some seconds"
"x83","the invisible glory of the moon. In that flash, continents, seas, and"
"x83","forests had become visible to them. Did an atmosphere, then, bring to"
"x83","this unknown face its life-giving atoms? Questions still insoluble, and"
"x83","forever closed against human curiousity!"
"x83",""
"x83","It was then half-past three in the afternoon. The projectile was"
"x83","following its curvilinear direction round the moon. Had its course"
"x83","again been altered by the meteor? It was to be feared so. But the"
"x83","projectile must describe a curve unalterably determined by the laws of"
"x83","mechanical reasoning. Barbicane was inclined to believe that this curve"
"x83","would be rather a parabola than a hyperbola. But admitting the"
"x83","parabola, the projectile must quickly have passed through the cone of"
"x83","shadow projected into space opposite the sun. This cone, indeed, is"
"x83","very narrow, the angular diameter of the moon being so little when"
"x83","compared with the diameter of the orb of day; and up to this time the"
"x83","projectile had been floating in this deep shadow. Whatever had been its"
"x83","speed (and it could not have been insignificant), its period of"
"x83","occultation continued. That was evident, but perhaps that would not"
"x83","have been the case in a supposedly rigidly parabolical trajectory—a new"
"x83","problem which tormented Barbicane’s brain, imprisoned as he was in a"
"x83","circle of unknowns which he could not unravel."
"x83",""
"x83","Neither of the travelers thought of taking an instant’s repose. Each"
"x83","one watched for an unexpected fact, which might throw some new light on"
"x83","their uranographic studies. About five o’clock, Michel Ardan"
"x83","distributed, under the name of dinner, some pieces of bread and cold"
"x83","meat, which were quickly swallowed without either of them abandoning"
"x83","their scuttle, the glass of which was incessantly encrusted by the"
"x83","condensation of vapor."
"x83",""
"x83","About forty-five minutes past five in the evening, Nicholl, armed with"
"x83","his glass, sighted toward the southern border of the moon, and in the"
"x83","direction followed by the projectile, some bright points cut upon the"
"x83","dark shield of the sky. They looked like a succession of sharp points"
"x83","lengthened into a tremulous line. They were very bright. Such appeared"
"x83","the terminal line of the moon when in one of her octants."
"x83",""
"x83","They could not be mistaken. It was no longer a simple meteor. This"
"x83","luminous ridge had neither color nor motion. Nor was it a volcano in"

"x83","“Only, I would have you observe, my worthy friend,” replied Barbicane,"

"x83","TYCHO"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","At six in the evening the projectile passed the south pole at less than"
"x83","forty miles off, a distance equal to that already reached at the north"
"x83","pole. The elliptical curve was being rigidly carried out."
"x83",""
"x83","At this moment the travelers once more entered the blessed rays of the"
"x83","sun. They saw once more those stars which move slowly from east to"
"x83","west. The radiant orb was saluted by a triple hurrah. With its light it"
"x83","also sent heat, which soon pierced the metal walls. The glass resumed"
"x83","its accustomed appearance. The layers of ice melted as if by"
"x83","enchantment; and immediately, for economy’s sake, the gas was put out,"
"x83","the air apparatus alone consuming its usual quantity."
"x83",""
"x83","“Ah!” said Nicholl, “these rays of heat are good. With what impatience"
"x83","must the Selenites wait the reappearance of the orb of day.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes,” replied Michel Ardan, “imbibing as it were the brilliant ether,"
"x83","light and heat, all life is contained in them.”"
"x83",""
"x83","At this moment the bottom of the projectile deviated somewhat from the"
"x83","lunar surface, in order to follow the slightly lengthened elliptical"
"x83","orbit. From this point, had the earth been at the full, Barbicane and"
"x83","his companions could have seen it, but immersed in the sun’s"
"x83","irradiation she was quite invisible. Another spectacle attracted their"
"x83","attention, that of the southern part of the moon, brought by the"
"x83","glasses to within 450 yards. They did not again leave the scuttles, and"
"x83","noted every detail of this fantastical continent."
"x83",""
"x83","Mounts Doerful and Leibnitz formed two separate groups very near the"
"x83","south pole. The first group extended from the pole to the eighty-fourth"
"x83","parallel, on the eastern part of the orb; the second occupied the"
"x83","eastern border, extending from the 65° of latitude to the pole."
"x83",""
"x83","On their capriciously formed ridge appeared dazzling sheets, as"
"x83","mentioned by Pere Secchi. With more certainty than the illustrious"
"x83","Roman astronomer, Barbicane was enabled to recognize their nature."
"x83",""
"x83","“They are snow,” he exclaimed."
"x83",""
"x83","“Snow?” repeated Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes, Nicholl, snow; the surface of which is deeply frozen. See how"
"x83","they reflect the luminous rays. Cooled lava would never give out such"
"x83","intense reflection. There must then be water, there must be air on the"
"x83","moon. As little as you please, but the fact can no longer be"
"x83","contested.” No, it could not be. And if ever Barbicane should see the"
"x83","earth again, his notes will bear witness to this great fact in his"
"x83","selenographic observations."
"x83",""
"x83","These mountains of Doerful and Leibnitz rose in the midst of plains of"
"x83","a medium extent, which were bounded by an indefinite succession of"
"x83","circles and annular ramparts. These two chains are the only ones met"
"x83","with in this region of circles. Comparatively but slightly marked, they"
"x83","throw up here and there some sharp points, the highest summit of which"
"x83","attains an altitude of 24,600 feet."
"x83",""
"x83","But the projectile was high above all this landscape, and the"
"x83","projections disappeared in the intense brilliancy of the disc. And to"
"x83","the eyes of the travelers there reappeared that original aspect of the"
"x83","lunar landscapes, raw in tone, without gradation of colors, and without"
"x83","degrees of shadow, roughly black and white, from the want of diffusion"
"x83","of light."
"x83",""
"x83","But the sight of this desolate world did not fail to captivate them by"
"x83","its very strangeness. They were moving over this region as if they had"
"x83","been borne on the breath of some storm, watching heights defile under"
"x83","their feet, piercing the cavities with their eyes, going down into the"
"x83","rifts, climbing the ramparts, sounding these mysterious holes, and"
"x83","leveling all cracks. But no trace of vegetation, no appearance of"
"x83","cities; nothing but stratification, beds of lava, overflowings polished"
"x83","like immense mirrors, reflecting the sun’s rays with overpowering"
"x83","brilliancy. Nothing belonging to a _living_ world—everything to a dead"
"x83","world, where avalanches, rolling from the summits of the mountains,"
"x83","would disperse noiselessly at the bottom of the abyss, retaining the"
"x83","motion, but wanting the sound. In any case it was the image of death,"
"x83","without its being possible even to say that life had ever existed"
"x83","there."
"x83",""
"x83","Michel Ardan, however, thought he recognized a heap of ruins, to which"
"x83","he drew Barbicane’s attention. It was about the 80th parallel, in 30°"
"x83","longitude. This heap of stones, rather regularly placed, represented a"
"x83","vast fortress, overlooking a long rift, which in former days had served"
"x83","as a bed to the rivers of prehistorical times. Not far from that, rose"
"x83","to a height of 17,400 feet the annular mountain of Short, equal to the"
"x83","Asiatic Caucasus. Michel Ardan, with his accustomed ardor, maintained"
"x83","“the evidences” of his fortress. Beneath it he discerned the dismantled"
"x83","ramparts of a town; here the still intact arch of a portico, there two"
"x83","or three columns lying under their base; farther on, a succession of"
"x83","arches which must have supported the conduit of an aqueduct; in another"
"x83","part the sunken pillars of a gigantic bridge, run into the thickest"
"x83","parts of the rift. He distinguished all this, but with so much"
"x83","imagination in his glance, and through glasses so fantastical, that we"
"x83","must mistrust his observation. But who could affirm, who would dare to"
"x83","say, that the amiable fellow did not really see that which his two"
"x83","companions would not see?"
"x83",""
"x83","Moments were too precious to be sacrificed in idle discussion. The"
"x83","selenite city, whether imaginary or not, had already disappeared afar"
"x83","off. The distance of the projectile from the lunar disc was on the"
"x83","increase, and the details of the soil were being lost in a confused"
"x83","jumble. The reliefs, the circles, the craters, and the plains alone"
"x83","remained, and still showed their boundary lines distinctly. At this"
"x83","moment, to the left, lay extended one of the finest circles of lunar"
"x83","orography, one of the curiosities of this continent. It was Newton,"
"x83","which Barbicane recognized without trouble, by referring to the _Mappa"
"x83","Selenographica_."
"x83",""
"x83","Newton is situated in exactly 77° south latitude, and 16° east"
"x83","longitude. It forms an annular crater, the ramparts of which, rising to"
"x83","a height of 21,300 feet, seemed to be impassable."
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane made his companions observe that the height of this mountain"
"x83","above the surrounding plain was far from equaling the depth of its"
"x83","crater. This enormous hole was beyond all measurement, and formed a"
"x83","gloomy abyss, the bottom of which the sun’s rays could never reach."
"x83","There, according to Humboldt, reigns utter darkness, which the light of"
"x83","the sun and the earth cannot break. Mythologists could well have made"
"x83","it the mouth of hell."
"x83",""
"x83","“Newton,” said Barbicane, “is the most perfect type of these annular"
"x83","mountains, of which the earth possesses no sample. They prove that the"
"x83","moon’s formation, by means of cooling, is due to violent causes; for"
"x83","while, under the pressure of internal fires the reliefs rise to"
"x83","considerable height, the depths withdraw far below the lunar level.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“I do not dispute the fact,” replied Michel Ardan."
"x83",""
"x83","Some minutes after passing Newton, the projectile directly overlooked"
"x83","the annular mountains of Moret. It skirted at some distance the summits"
"x83","of Blancanus, and at about half-past seven in the evening reached the"
"x83","circle of Clavius."
"x83",""
"x83","This circle, one of the most remarkable of the disc, is situated in 58°"
"x83","south latitude, and 15° east longitude. Its height is estimated at"
"x83","22,950 feet. The travelers, at a distance of twenty-four miles (reduced"
"x83","to four by their glasses) could admire this vast crater in its"
"x83","entirety."
"x83",""
"x83","“Terrestrial volcanoes,” said Barbicane, “are but mole-hills compared"
"x83","with those of the moon. Measuring the old craters formed by the first"
"x83","eruptions of Vesuvius and Etna, we find them little more than three"
"x83","miles in breadth. In France the circle of Cantal measures six miles"
"x83","across; at Ceyland the circle of the island is forty miles, which is"
"x83","considered the largest on the globe. What are these diameters against"
"x83","that of Clavius, which we overlook at this moment?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“What is its breadth?” asked Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","“It is 150 miles,” replied Barbicane. “This circle is certainly the"
"x83","most important on the moon, but many others measure 150, 100, or 75"
"x83","miles.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Ah! my friends,” exclaimed Michel, “can you picture to yourselves what"
"x83","this now peaceful orb of night must have been when its craters, filled"
"x83","with thunderings, vomited at the same time smoke and tongues of flame."
"x83","What a wonderful spectacle then, and now what decay! This moon is"
"x83","nothing more than a thin carcase of fireworks, whose squibs, rockets,"
"x83","serpents, and suns, after a superb brilliancy, have left but sadly"
"x83","broken cases. Who can say the cause, the reason, the motive force of"
"x83","these cataclysms?”"
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane was not listening to Michel Ardan; he was contemplating these"
"x83","ramparts of Clavius, formed by large mountains spread over several"
"x83","miles. At the bottom of the immense cavity burrowed hundreds of small"
"x83","extinguished craters, riddling the soil like a colander, and overlooked"
"x83","by a peak 15,000 feet high."
"x83",""
"x83","Around the plain appeared desolate. Nothing so arid as these reliefs,"
"x83","nothing so sad as these ruins of mountains, and (if we may so express"
"x83","ourselves) these fragments of peaks and mountains which strewed the"
"x83","soil. The satellite seemed to have burst at this spot."
"x83",""
"x83","The projectile was still advancing, and this movement did not subside."
"x83","Circles, craters, and uprooted mountains succeeded each other"
"x83","incessantly. No more plains; no more seas. A never ending Switzerland"
"x83","and Norway. And lastly, in the canter of this region of crevasses, the"
"x83","most splendid mountain on the lunar disc, the dazzling Tycho, in which"
"x83","posterity will ever preserve the name of the illustrious Danish"
"x83","astronomer."
"x83",""
"x83","In observing the full moon in a cloudless sky no one has failed to"
"x83","remark this brilliant point of the southern hemisphere. Michel Ardan"
"x83","used every metaphor that his imagination could supply to designate it"
"x83","by. To him this Tycho was a focus of light, a center of irradiation, a"
"x83","crater vomiting rays. It was the tire of a brilliant wheel, an"
"x83","_asteria_ enclosing the disc with its silver tentacles, an enormous eye"
"x83","filled with flames, a glory carved for Pluto’s head, a star launched by"
"x83","the Creator’s hand, and crushed against the face of the moon!"
"x83",""
"x83","Tycho forms such a concentration of light that the inhabitants of the"
"x83","earth can see it without glasses, though at a distance of 240,000"
"x83","miles! Imagine, then, its intensity to the eye of observers placed at a"
"x83","distance of only fifty miles! Seen through this pure ether, its"
"x83","brilliancy was so intolerable that Barbicane and his friends were"
"x83","obliged to blacken their glasses with the gas smoke before they could"
"x83","bear the splendor. Then silent, scarcely uttering an interjection of"
"x83","admiration, they gazed, they contemplated. All their feelings, all"
"x83","their impressions, were concentrated in that look, as under any violent"
"x83","emotion all life is concentrated at the heart."
"x83",""
"x83","Tycho belongs to the system of radiating mountains, like Aristarchus"
"x83","and Copernicus; but it is of all the most complete and decided, showing"
"x83","unquestionably the frightful volcanic action to which the formation of"
"x83","the moon is due. Tycho is situated in 43° south latitude, and 12° east"
"x83","longitude. Its center is occupied by a crater fifty miles broad. It"
"x83","assumes a slightly elliptical form, and is surrounded by an enclosure"
"x83","of annular ramparts, which on the east and west overlook the outer"
"x83","plain from a height of 15,000 feet. It is a group of Mont Blancs,"
"x83","placed round one common center and crowned by radiating beams."
"x83",""
"x83","What this incomparable mountain really is, with all the projections"
"x83","converging toward it, and the interior excrescences of its crater,"
"x83","photography itself could never represent. Indeed, it is during the full"
"x83","moon that Tycho is seen in all its splendor. Then all shadows"
"x83","disappear, the foreshortening of perspective disappears, and all proofs"
"x83","become white—a disagreeable fact: for this strange region would have"
"x83","been marvelous if reproduced with photographic exactness. It is but a"
"x83","group of hollows, craters, circles, a network of crests; then, as far"
"x83","as the eye could see, a whole volcanic network cast upon this encrusted"
"x83","soil. One can then understand that the bubbles of this central eruption"
"x83","have kept their first form. Crystallized by cooling, they have"
"x83","stereotyped that aspect which the moon formerly presented when under"
"x83","the Plutonian forces."
"x83",""
"x83","The distance which separated the travelers from the annular summits of"
"x83","Tycho was not so great but that they could catch the principal details."
"x83","Even on the causeway forming the fortifications of Tycho, the mountains"
"x83","hanging on to the interior and exterior sloping flanks rose in stories"
"x83","like gigantic terraces. They appeared to be higher by 300 or 400 feet"
"x83","to the west than to the east. No system of terrestrial encampment could"
"x83","equal these natural fortifications. A town built at the bottom of this"
"x83","circular cavity would have been utterly inaccessible."
"x83",""
"x83","Inaccessible and wonderfully extended over this soil covered with"
"x83","picturesque projections! Indeed, nature had not left the bottom of this"
"x83","crater flat and empty. It possessed its own peculiar orography, a"
"x83","mountainous system, making it a world in itself. The travelers could"
"x83","distinguish clearly cones, central hills, remarkable positions of the"
"x83","soil, naturally placed to receive the _chefs-d’œuvre_ of Selenite"
"x83","architecture. There was marked out the place for a temple, here the"
"x83","ground of a forum, on this spot the plan of a palace, in another the"
"x83","plateau for a citadel; the whole overlooked by a central mountain of"
"x83","1,500 feet. A vast circle, in which ancient Rome could have been held"
"x83","in its entirety ten times over."
"x83",""
"x83","“Ah!” exclaimed Michel Ardan, enthusiastic at the sight; “what a grand"
"x83","town might be constructed within that ring of mountains! A quiet city,"
"x83","a peaceful refuge, beyond all human misery. How calm and isolated those"
"x83","misanthropes, those haters of humanity might live there, and all who"
"x83","have a distaste for social life!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“All! It would be too small for them,” replied Barbicane simply."

"x83","CHAPTER XVIII."
"x83","GRAVE QUESTIONS"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","But the projectile had passed the _enceinte_ of Tycho, and Barbicane"
"x83","and his two companions watched with scrupulous attention the brilliant"
"x83","rays which the celebrated mountain shed so curiously over the horizon."
"x83",""
"x83","What was this radiant glory? What geological phenomenon had designed"
"x83","these ardent beams? This question occupied Barbicane’s mind."
"x83",""
"x83","Under his eyes ran in all directions luminous furrows, raised at the"
"x83","edges and concave in the center, some twelve miles, others thirty miles"
"x83","broad. These brilliant trains extended in some places to within 600"
"x83","miles of Tycho, and seemed to cover, particularly toward the east, the"
"x83","northeast and the north, the half of the southern hemisphere. One of"
"x83","these jets extended as far as the circle of Neander, situated on the"
"x83","40th meridian. Another, by a slight curve, furrowed the “Sea of"
"x83","Nectar,” breaking against the chain of Pyrenees, after a circuit of 800"
"x83","miles. Others, toward the west, covered the “Sea of Clouds” and the"
"x83","“Sea of Humors” with a luminous network. What was the origin of these"
"x83","sparkling rays, which shone on the plains as well as on the reliefs, at"
"x83","whatever height they might be? All started from a common center, the"
"x83","crater of Tycho. They sprang from him. Herschel attributed their"
"x83","brilliancy to currents of lava congealed by the cold; an opinion,"
"x83","however, which has not been generally adopted. Other astronomers have"
"x83","seen in these inexplicable rays a kind of moraines, rows of erratic"
"x83","blocks, which had been thrown up at the period of Tycho’s formation."
"x83",""
"x83","“And why not?” asked Nicholl of Barbicane, who was relating and"
"x83","rejecting these different opinions."
"x83",""
"x83","“Because the regularity of these luminous lines, and the violence"
"x83","necessary to carry volcanic matter to such distances, is inexplicable.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Eh! by Jove!” replied Michel Ardan, “it seems easy enough to me to"
"x83","explain the origin of these rays.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Indeed?” said Barbicane."
"x83",""
"x83","“Indeed,” continued Michel. “It is enough to say that it is a vast"
"x83","star, similar to that produced by a ball or a stone thrown at a square"
"x83","of glass!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Well!” replied Barbicane, smiling. “And what hand would be powerful"
"x83","enough to throw a ball to give such a shock as that?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“The hand is not necessary,” answered Nicholl, not at all confounded;"
"x83","“and as to the stone, let us suppose it to be a comet.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Ah! those much-abused comets!” exclaimed Barbicane. “My brave Michel,"
"x83","your explanation is not bad; but your comet is useless. The shock which"
"x83","produced that rent must have some from the inside of the star. A"
"x83","violent contraction of the lunar crust, while cooling, might suffice to"
"x83","imprint this gigantic star.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“A contraction! something like a lunar stomach-ache.” said Michel"
"x83","Ardan."
"x83",""
"x83","“Besides,” added Barbicane, “this opinion is that of an English savant,"
"x83","Nasmyth, and it seems to me to sufficiently explain the radiation of"
"x83","these mountains.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“That Nasmyth was no fool!” replied Michel."
"x83",""
"x83","Long did the travelers, whom such a sight could never weary, admire the"
"x83","splendors of Tycho. Their projectile, saturated with luminous gleams in"
"x83","the double irradiation of sun and moon, must have appeared like an"
"x83","incandescent globe. They had passed suddenly from excessive cold to"
"x83","intense heat. Nature was thus preparing them to become Selenites."
"x83","Become Selenites! That idea brought up once more the question of the"
"x83","habitability of the moon. After what they had seen, could the travelers"
"x83","solve it? Would they decide for or against it? Michel Ardan persuaded"
"x83","his two friends to form an opinion, and asked them directly if they"
"x83","thought that men and animals were represented in the lunar world."
"x83",""
"x83","“I think that we can answer,” said Barbicane; “but according to my idea"
"x83","the question ought not to be put in that form. I ask it to be put"
"x83","differently.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Put it your own way,” replied Michel."
"x83",""
"x83","“Here it is,” continued Barbicane. “The problem is a double one, and"
"x83","requires a double solution. Is the moon _habitable_? Has the moon ever"
"x83","been _inhabitable_?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Good!” replied Nicholl. “First let us see whether the moon is"
"x83","habitable.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“To tell the truth, I know nothing about it,” answered Michel."
"x83",""
"x83","“And I answer in the negative,” continued Barbicane. “In her actual"
"x83","state, with her surrounding atmosphere certainly very much reduced, her"
"x83","seas for the most part dried up, her insufficient supply of water"
"x83","restricted, vegetation, sudden alternations of cold and heat, her days"
"x83","and nights of 354 hours—the moon does not seem habitable to me, nor"
"x83","does she seem propitious to animal development, nor sufficient for the"
"x83","wants of existence as we understand it.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Agreed,” replied Nicholl. “But is not the moon habitable for creatures"
"x83","differently organized from ourselves?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“That question is more difficult to answer, but I will try; and I ask"
"x83","Nicholl if _motion_ appears to him to be a necessary result of _life_,"
"x83","whatever be its organization?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Without a doubt!” answered Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","“Then, my worthy companion, I would answer that we have observed the"
"x83","lunar continent at a distance of 500 yards at most, and that nothing"
"x83","seemed to us to move on the moon’s surface. The presence of any kind of"
"x83","life would have been betrayed by its attendant marks, such as divers"
"x83","buildings, and even by ruins. And what have we seen? Everywhere and"
"x83","always the geological works of nature, never the work of man. If, then,"
"x83","there exist representatives of the animal kingdom on the moon, they"
"x83","must have fled to those unfathomable cavities which the eye cannot"
"x83","reach; which I cannot admit, for they must have left traces of their"
"x83","passage on those plains which the atmosphere must cover, however"
"x83","slightly raised it may be. These traces are nowhere visible. There"
"x83","remains but one hypothesis, that of a living race to which motion,"
"x83","which is life, is foreign.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“One might as well say, living creatures which do not live,” replied"
"x83","Michel."
"x83",""
"x83","“Just so,” said Barbicane, “which for us has no meaning.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Then we may form our opinion?” said Michel."
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes,” replied Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","“Very well,” continued Michel Ardan, “the Scientific Commission"
"x83","assembled in the projectile of the Gun Club, after having founded their"
"x83","argument on facts recently observed, decide unanimously upon the"
"x83","question of the habitability of the moon—‘_No!_ the moon is not"
"x83","habitable.’”"
"x83",""
"x83","This decision was consigned by President Barbicane to his notebook,"
"x83","where the process of the sitting of the 6th of December may be seen."
"x83",""
"x83","“Now,” said Nicholl, “let us attack the second question, an"
"x83","indispensable complement of the first. I ask the honorable commission,"
"x83","if the moon is not habitable, has she ever been inhabited, Citizen"
"x83","Barbicane?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“My friends,” replied Barbicane, “I did not undertake this journey in"
"x83","order to form an opinion on the past habitability of our satellite; but"
"x83","I will add that our personal observations only confirm me in this"
"x83","opinion. I believe, indeed I affirm, that the moon has been inhabited"
"x83","by a human race organized like our own; that she has produced animals"
"x83","anatomically formed like the terrestrial animals: but I add that these"
"x83","races, human and animal, have had their day, and are now forever"
"x83","extinct!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Then,” asked Michel, “the moon must be older than the earth?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“No!” said Barbicane decidedly, “but a world which has grown old"
"x83","quicker, and whose formation and deformation have been more rapid."
"x83","Relatively, the organizing force of matter has been much more violent"
"x83","in the interior of the moon than in the interior of the terrestrial"
"x83","globe. The actual state of this cracked, twisted, and burst disc"
"x83","abundantly proves this. The moon and the earth were nothing but gaseous"
"x83","masses originally. These gases have passed into a liquid state under"
"x83","different influences, and the solid masses have been formed later. But"
"x83","most certainly our sphere was still gaseous or liquid, when the moon"
"x83","was solidified by cooling, and had become habitable.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“I believe it,” said Nicholl."

"x83","“Then,” continued Barbicane, “an atmosphere surrounded it, the waters"
"x83","contained within this gaseous envelope could not evaporate. Under the"
"x83","influence of air, water, light, solar heat, and central heat,"
"x83","vegetation took possession of the continents prepared to receive it,"
"x83","and certainly life showed itself about this period, for nature does not"
"x83","expend herself in vain; and a world so wonderfully formed for"
"x83","habitation must necessarily be inhabited.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“But,” said Nicholl, “many phenomena inherent in our satellite might"
"x83","cramp the expansion of the animal and vegetable kingdom. For example,"
"x83","its days and nights of 354 hours?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“At the terrestrial poles they last six months,” said Michel."
"x83",""
"x83","“An argument of little value, since the poles are not inhabited.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Let us observe, my friends,” continued Barbicane, “that if in the"
"x83","actual state of the moon its long nights and long days created"
"x83","differences of temperature insupportable to organization, it was not so"
"x83","at the historical period of time. The atmosphere enveloped the disc"
"x83","with a fluid mantle; vapor deposited itself in the shape of clouds;"
"x83","this natural screen tempered the ardor of the solar rays, and retained"
"x83","the nocturnal radiation. Light, like heat, can diffuse itself in the"
"x83","air; hence an equality between the influences which no longer exists,"
"x83","now that atmosphere has almost entirely disappeared. And now I am going"
"x83","to astonish you.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Astonish us?” said Michel Ardan."
"x83",""
"x83","“I firmly believe that at the period when the moon was inhabited, the"
"x83","nights and days did not last 354 hours!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“And why?” asked Nicholl quickly."
"x83",""
"x83","“Because most probably then the rotary motion of the moon upon her axis"
"x83","was not equal to her revolution, an equality which presents each part"
"x83","of her disc during fifteen days to the action of the solar rays.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Granted,” replied Nicholl, “but why should not these two motions have"
"x83","been equal, as they are really so?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Because that equality has only been determined by terrestrial"
"x83","attraction. And who can say that this attraction was powerful enough to"
"x83","alter the motion of the moon at that period when the earth was still"
"x83","fluid?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Just so,” replied Nicholl; “and who can say that the moon has always"
"x83","been a satellite of the earth?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“And who can say,” exclaimed Michel Ardan, “that the moon did not exist"
"x83","before the earth?”"
"x83",""
"x83","Their imaginations carried them away into an indefinite field of"
"x83","hypothesis. Barbicane sought to restrain them."
"x83",""
"x83","“Those speculations are too high,” said he; “problems utterly"
"x83","insoluble. Do not let us enter upon them. Let us only admit the"
"x83","insufficiency of the primordial attraction; and then by the inequality"
"x83","of the two motions of rotation and revolution, the days and nights"
"x83","could have succeeded each other on the moon as they succeed each other"
"x83","on the earth. Besides, even without these conditions, life was"
"x83","possible.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“And so,” asked Michel Ardan, “humanity has disappeared from the moon?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes,” replied Barbicane, “after having doubtless remained persistently"
"x83","for millions of centuries; by degrees the atmosphere becoming rarefied,"
"x83","the disc became uninhabitable, as the terrestrial globe will one day"
"x83","become by cooling.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“By cooling?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Certainly,” replied Barbicane; “as the internal fires became"
"x83","extinguished, and the incandescent matter concentrated itself, the"
"x83","lunar crust cooled. By degrees the consequences of these phenomena"
"x83","showed themselves in the disappearance of organized beings, and by the"
"x83","disappearance of vegetation. Soon the atmosphere was rarefied, probably"
"x83","withdrawn by terrestrial attraction; then aerial departure of"
"x83","respirable air, and disappearance of water by means of evaporation. At"
"x83","this period the moon becoming uninhabitable, was no longer inhabited."
"x83","It was a dead world, such as we see it to-day.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“And you say that the same fate is in store for the earth?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Most probably.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“But when?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“When the cooling of its crust shall have made it uninhabitable.”"

"x83","“And have they calculated the time which our unfortunate sphere will"

"x83",""
"x83","“Certainly.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“And you know these calculations?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Perfectly.”"

"x83","“But speak, then, my clumsy savant,” exclaimed Michel Ardan, “for you"
"x83","make me boil with impatience!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Very well, my good Michel,” replied Barbicane quietly; “we know what"
"x83","diminution of temperature the earth undergoes in the lapse of a"
"x83","century. And according to certain calculations, this mean temperature"
"x83","will after a period of 400,000 years, be brought down to zero!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Four hundred thousand years!” exclaimed Michel. “Ah! I breathe again."
"x83","Really I was frightened to hear you; I imagined that we had not more"
"x83","than 50,000 years to live.”"
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane and Nicholl could not help laughing at their companion’s"
"x83","uneasiness. Then Nicholl, who wished to end the discussion, put the"
"x83","second question, which had just been considered again."
"x83",""
"x83","“Has the moon been inhabited?” he asked."
"x83",""
"x83","The answer was unanimously in the affirmative. But during this"
"x83","discussion, fruitful in somewhat hazardous theories, the projectile was"
"x83","rapidly leaving the moon: the lineaments faded away from the travelers’"
"x83","eyes, mountains were confused in the distance; and of all the"
"x83","wonderful, strange, and fantastical form of the earth’s satellite,"
"x83","there soon remained nothing but the imperishable remembrance."

"x83","CHAPTER XIX."
"x83","A STRUGGLE AGAINST THE IMPOSSIBLE"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","For a long time Barbicane and his companions looked silently and sadly"
"x83","upon that world which they had only seen from a distance, as Moses saw"
"x83","the land of Canaan, and which they were leaving without a possibility"
"x83","of ever returning to it. The projectile’s position with regard to the"
"x83","moon had altered, and the base was now turned to the earth."
"x83",""
"x83","This change, which Barbicane verified, did not fail to surprise them."
"x83","If the projectile was to gravitate round the satellite in an elliptical"
"x83","orbit, why was not its heaviest part turned toward it, as the moon"
"x83","turns hers to the earth? That was a difficult point."
"x83",""
"x83","In watching the course of the projectile they could see that on leaving"
"x83","the moon it followed a course analogous to that traced in approaching"
"x83","her. It was describing a very long ellipse, which would most likely"
"x83","extend to the point of equal attraction, where the influences of the"
"x83","earth and its satellite are neutralized."
"x83",""
"x83","Such was the conclusion which Barbicane very justly drew from facts"
"x83","already observed, a conviction which his two friends shared with him."
"x83",""
"x83","“And when arrived at this dead point, what will become of us?” asked"
"x83","Michel Ardan."
"x83",""
"x83","“We don’t know,” replied Barbicane."
"x83",""
"x83","“But one can draw some hypotheses, I suppose?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Two,” answered Barbicane; “either the projectile’s speed will be"
"x83","insufficient, and it will remain forever immovable on this line of"
"x83","double attraction—”"
"x83",""
"x83","“I prefer the other hypothesis, whatever it may be,” interrupted"
"x83","Michel."
"x83",""
"x83","“Or,” continued Barbicane, “its speed will be sufficient, and it will"
"x83","continue its elliptical course, to gravitate forever around the orb of"
"x83","night.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“A revolution not at all consoling,” said Michel, “to pass to the state"
"x83","of humble servants to a moon whom we are accustomed to look upon as our"
"x83","own handmaid. So that is the fate in store for us?”"
"x83",""
"x83","Neither Barbicane nor Nicholl answered."
"x83",""
"x83","“You do not answer,” continued Michel impatiently."
"x83",""
"x83","“There is nothing to answer,” said Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","“Is there nothing to try?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“No,” answered Barbicane. “Do you pretend to fight against the"
"x83","impossible?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Why not? Do one Frenchman and two Americans shrink from such a word?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“But what would you do?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Subdue this motion which is bearing us away.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Subdue it?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes,” continued Michel, getting animated, “or else alter it, and"
"x83","employ it to the accomplishment of our own ends.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“And how?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“That is your affair. If artillerymen are not masters of their"
"x83","projectile they are not artillerymen. If the projectile is to command"
"x83","the gunner, we had better ram the gunner into the gun. My faith! fine"
"x83","savants! who do not know what is to become of us after inducing me—”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Inducing you!” cried Barbicane and Nicholl. “Inducing you! What do you"
"x83","mean by that?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“No recrimination,” said Michel. “I do not complain, the trip has"
"x83","pleased me, and the projectile agrees with me; but let us do all that"
"x83","is humanly possible to do the fall somewhere, even if only on the"
"x83","moon.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“We ask no better, my worthy Michel,” replied Barbicane, “but means"
"x83","fail us.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“We cannot alter the motion of the projectile?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“No.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Nor diminish its speed?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“No.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Not even by lightening it, as they lighten an overloaded vessel?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“What would you throw out?” said Nicholl. “We have no ballast on board;"
"x83","and indeed it seems to me that if lightened it would go much quicker.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Slower.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Quicker.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Neither slower nor quicker,” said Barbicane, wishing to make his two"
"x83","friends agree; “for we float is space, and must no longer consider"
"x83","specific weight.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Very well,” cried Michel Ardan in a decided voice; “then their remains"
"x83","but one thing to do.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“What is it?” asked Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","“Breakfast,” answered the cool, audacious Frenchman, who always brought"
"x83","up this solution at the most difficult juncture."
"x83",""
"x83","In any case, if this operation had no influence on the projectile’s"
"x83","course, it could at least be tried without inconvenience, and even with"
"x83","success from a stomachic point of view. Certainly Michel had none but"
"x83","good ideas."
"x83",""
"x83","They breakfasted then at two in the morning; the hour mattered little."
"x83","Michel served his usual repast, crowned by a glorious bottle drawn from"
"x83","his private cellar. If ideas did not crowd on their brains, we must"
"x83","despair of the Chambertin of 1853. The repast finished, observation"
"x83","began again. Around the projectile, at an invariable distance, were the"
"x83","objects which had been thrown out. Evidently, in its translatory motion"
"x83","round the moon, it had not passed through any atmosphere, for the"
"x83","specific weight of these different objects would have checked their"
"x83","relative speed."
"x83",""
"x83","On the side of the terrestrial sphere nothing was to be seen. The earth"
"x83","was but a day old, having been new the night before at twelve; and two"
"x83","days must elapse before its crescent, freed from the solar rays, would"
"x83","serve as a clock to the Selenites, as in its rotary movement each of"
"x83","its points after twenty-four hours repasses the same lunar meridian."
"x83",""
"x83","On the moon’s side the sight was different; the orb shone in all her"
"x83","splendor amid innumerable constellations, whose purity could not be"
"x83","troubled by her rays. On the disc, the plains were already returning to"
"x83","the dark tint which is seen from the earth. The other part of the"
"x83","nimbus remained brilliant, and in the midst of this general brilliancy"
"x83","Tycho shone prominently like a sun."
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane had no means of estimating the projectile’s speed, but"
"x83","reasoning showed that it must uniformly decrease, according to the laws"
"x83","of mechanical reasoning. Having admitted that the projectile was"
"x83","describing an orbit around the moon, this orbit must necessarily be"
"x83","elliptical; science proves that it must be so. No motive body"
"x83","circulating round an attracting body fails in this law. Every orbit"
"x83","described in space is elliptical. And why should the projectile of the"
"x83","Gun Club escape this natural arrangement? In elliptical orbits, the"
"x83","attracting body always occupies one of the foci; so that at one moment"
"x83","the satellite is nearer, and at another farther from the orb around"
"x83","which it gravitates. When the earth is nearest the sun she is in her"
"x83","perihelion; and in her aphelion at the farthest point. Speaking of the"
"x83","moon, she is nearest to the earth in her perigee, and farthest from it"
"x83","in her apogee. To use analogous expressions, with which the"
"x83","astronomers’ language is enriched, if the projectile remains as a"
"x83","satellite of the moon, we must say that it is in its “aposelene” at its"
"x83","farthest point, and in its “periselene” at its nearest. In the latter"
"x83","case, the projectile would attain its maximum of speed; and in the"
"x83","former its minimum. It was evidently moving toward its aposelenitical"
"x83","point; and Barbicane had reason to think that its speed would decrease"
"x83","up to this point, and then increase by degrees as it neared the moon."
"x83","This speed would even become _nil_, if this point joined that of equal"
"x83","attraction. Barbicane studied the consequences of these different"
"x83","situations, and thinking what inference he could draw from them, when"
"x83","he was roughly disturbed by a cry from Michel Ardan."
"x83",""
"x83","“By Jove!” he exclaimed, “I must admit we are down-right simpletons!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“I do not say we are not,” replied Barbicane; “but why?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Because we have a very simple means of checking this speed which is"
"x83","bearing us from the moon, and we do not use it!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“And what is the means?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“To use the recoil contained in our rockets.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Done!” said Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","“We have not used this force yet,” said Barbicane, “it is true, but we"
"x83","will do so.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“When?” asked Michel."
"x83",""
"x83","“When the time comes. Observe, my friends, that in the position"
"x83","occupied by the projectile, an oblique position with regard to the"
"x83","lunar disc, our rockets, in slightly altering its direction, might turn"
"x83","it from the moon instead of drawing it nearer?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Just so,” replied Michel."
"x83",""
"x83","“Let us wait, then. By some inexplicable influence, the projectile is"
"x83","turning its base toward the earth. It is probable that at the point of"
"x83","equal attraction, its conical cap will be directed rigidly toward the"
"x83","moon; at that moment we may hope that its speed will be _nil_; then"
"x83","will be the moment to act, and with the influence of our rockets we may"
"x83","perhaps provoke a fall directly on the surface of the lunar disc.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Bravo!” said Michel. “What we did not do, what we could not do on our"
"x83","first passage at the dead point, because the projectile was then"
"x83","endowed with too great a speed.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Very well reasoned,” said Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","“Let us wait patiently,” continued Barbicane. “Putting every chance on"
"x83","our side, and after having so much despaired, I may say I think we"
"x83","shall gain our end.”"
"x83",""
"x83","This conclusion was a signal for Michel Ardan’s hips and hurrahs. And"
"x83","none of the audacious boobies remembered the question that they"
"x83","themselves had solved in the negative. No! the moon is not inhabited;"
"x83","no! the moon is probably not habitable. And yet they were going to try"
"x83","everything to reach her."
"x83",""
"x83","One single question remained to be solved. At what precise moment the"
"x83","projectile would reach the point of equal attraction, on which the"
"x83","travelers must play their last card. In order to calculate this to"
"x83","within a few seconds, Barbicane had only to refer to his notes, and to"
"x83","reckon the different heights taken on the lunar parallels. Thus the"
"x83","time necessary to travel over the distance between the dead point and"
"x83","the south pole would be equal to the distance separating the north pole"
"x83","from the dead point. The hours representing the time traveled over were"
"x83","carefully noted, and the calculation was easy. Barbicane found that"
"x83","this point would be reached at one in the morning on the night of the"
"x83","7th-8th of December. So that, if nothing interfered with its course, it"
"x83","would reach the given point in twenty-two hours."
"x83",""
"x83","The rockets had primarily been placed to check the fall of the"
"x83","projectile upon the moon, and now they were going to employ them for a"
"x83","directly contrary purpose. In any case they were ready, and they had"
"x83","only to wait for the moment to set fire to them."
"x83",""
"x83","“Since there is nothing else to be done,” said Nicholl, “I make a"
"x83","proposition.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“What is it?” asked Barbicane."
"x83",""
"x83","“I propose to go to sleep.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“What a motion!” exclaimed Michel Ardan."
"x83",""
"x83","“It is forty hours since we closed our eyes,” said Nicholl. “Some hours"
"x83","of sleep will restore our strength.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Never,” interrupted Michel."
"x83",""
"x83","“Well,” continued Nicholl, “every one to his taste; I shall go to"
"x83","sleep.” And stretching himself on the divan, he soon snored like a"
"x83","forty-eight pounder."
"x83",""
"x83","“That Nicholl has a good deal of sense,” said Barbicane; “presently I"
"x83","shall follow his example.” Some moments after his continued bass"
"x83","supported the captain’s baritone."
"x83",""
"x83","“Certainly,” said Michel Ardan, finding himself alone, “these practical"
"x83","people have sometimes most opportune ideas.”"
"x83",""
"x83","And with his long legs stretched out, and his great arms folded under"
"x83","his head, Michel slept in his turn."
"x83",""
"x83","But this sleep could be neither peaceful nor lasting, the minds of"
"x83","these three men were too much occupied, and some hours after, about"
"x83","seven in the morning, all three were on foot at the same instant."
"x83",""
"x83","The projectile was still leaving the moon, and turning its conical part"
"x83","more and more toward her."
"x83",""
"x83","An explicable phenomenon, but one which happily served Barbicane’s"
"x83","ends."
"x83",""
"x83","Seventeen hours more, and the moment for action would have arrived."
"x83",""
"x83","The day seemed long. However bold the travelers might be, they were"
"x83","greatly impressed by the approach of that moment which would decide"
"x83","all—either precipitate their fall on to the moon, or forever chain them"
"x83","in an immutable orbit. They counted the hours as they passed too slow"
"x83","for their wish; Barbicane and Nicholl were obstinately plunged in their"
"x83","calculations, Michel going and coming between the narrow walls, and"
"x83","watching that impassive moon with a longing eye."
"x83",""
"x83","At times recollections of the earth crossed their minds. They saw once"
"x83","more their friends of the Gun Club, and the dearest of all, J. T."
"x83","Maston. At that moment, the honorable secretary must be filling his"
"x83","post on the Rocky Mountains. If he could see the projectile through the"
"x83","glass of his gigantic telescope, what would he think? After seeing it"
"x83","disappear behind the moon’s south pole, he would see them reappear by"
"x83","the north pole! They must therefore be a satellite of a satellite! Had"
"x83","J. T. Maston given this unexpected news to the world? Was this the"
"x83","_denouement_ of this great enterprise?"
"x83",""
"x83","But the day passed without incident. The terrestrial midnight arrived."
"x83","The 8th of December was beginning. One hour more, and the point of"
"x83","equal attraction would be reached. What speed would then animate the"
"x83","projectile? They could not estimate it. But no error could vitiate"
"x83","Barbicane’s calculations. At one in the morning this speed ought to be"
"x83","and would be _nil_."
"x83",""
"x83","Besides, another phenomenon would mark the projectile’s stopping-point"
"x83","on the neutral line. At that spot the two attractions, lunar and"
"x83","terrestrial, would be annulled. Objects would “weigh” no more. This"
"x83","singular fact, which had surprised Barbicane and his companions so much"
"x83","in going, would be repeated on their return under the very same"
"x83","conditions. At this precise moment they must act."
"x83",""
"x83","Already the projectile’s conical top was sensibly turned toward the"
"x83","lunar disc, presented in such a way as to utilize the whole of the"
"x83","recoil produced by the pressure of the rocket apparatus. The chances"
"x83","were in favor of the travelers. If its speed was utterly annulled on"
"x83","this dead point, a decided movement toward the moon would suffice,"
"x83","however slight, to determine its fall."
"x83",""
"x83","“Five minutes to one,” said Nicholl."
"x83",""
"x83","“All is ready,” replied Michel Ardan, directing a lighted match to the"
"x83","flame of the gas."
"x83",""
"x83","“Wait!” said Barbicane, holding his chronometer in his hand."
"x83",""
"x83","At that moment weight had no effect. The travelers felt in themselves"
"x83","the entire disappearance of it. They were very near the neutral point,"
"x83","if they did not touch it."
"x83",""
"x83","“One o’clock,” said Barbicane."
"x83",""
"x83","Michel Ardan applied the lighted match to a train in communication with"
"x83","the rockets. No detonation was heard in the inside, for there was no"
"x83","air. But, through the scuttles, Barbicane saw a prolonged smoke, the"
"x83","flames of which were immediately extinguished."
"x83",""
"x83","The projectile sustained a certain shock, which was sensibly felt in"
"x83","the interior."
"x83",""
"x83","The three friends looked and listened without speaking, and scarcely"
"x83","breathing. One might have heard the beating of their hearts amid this"
"x83","perfect silence."
"x83",""
"x83","“Are we falling?” asked Michel Ardan, at length."
"x83",""
"x83","“No,” said Nicholl, “since the bottom of the projectile is not turning"
"x83","to the lunar disc!”"
"x83",""
"x83","At this moment, Barbicane, quitting his scuttle, turned to his two"
"x83","companions. He was frightfully pale, his forehead wrinkled, and his"
"x83","lips contracted."
"x83",""
"x83","“We are falling!” said he."
"x83",""
"x83","“Ah!” cried Michel Ardan, “on to the moon?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“On to the earth!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“The devil!” exclaimed Michel Ardan, adding philosophically, “well,"
"x83","when we came into this projectile we were very doubtful as to the ease"
"x83","with which we should get out of it!”"
"x83",""
"x83","And now this fearful fall had begun. The speed retained had borne the"
"x83","projectile beyond the dead point. The explosion of the rockets could"
"x83","not divert its course. This speed in going had carried it over the"
"x83","neutral line, and in returning had done the same thing. The laws of"
"x83","physics condemned it _to pass through every point which it had already"

"x83","THE SOUNDINGS OF THE SUSQUEHANNA"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","Well, lieutenant, and our soundings?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“I think, sir, that the operation is nearing its completion,” replied"
"x83","Lieutenant Bronsfield. “But who would have thought of finding such a"
"x83","depth so near in shore, and only 200 miles from the American coast?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Certainly, Bronsfield, there is a great depression,” said Captain"
"x83","Blomsberry. “In this spot there is a submarine valley worn by"
"x83","Humboldt’s current, which skirts the coast of America as far as the"
"x83","Straits of Magellan.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“These great depths,” continued the lieutenant, “are not favorable for"
"x83","laying telegraphic cables. A level bottom, like that supporting the"
"x83","American cable between Valentia and Newfoundland, is much better.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“I agree with you, Bronsfield. With your permission, lieutenant, where"
"x83","are we now?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Sir, at this moment we have 3,508 fathoms of line out, and the ball"
"x83","which draws the sounding lead has not yet touched the bottom; for if"
"x83","so, it would have come up of itself.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Brook’s apparatus is very ingenious,” said Captain Blomsberry; “it"
"x83","gives us very exact soundings.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Touch!” cried at this moment one of the men at the forewheel, who was"
"x83","superintending the operation."
"x83",""
"x83","The captain and the lieutenant mounted the quarterdeck."
"x83",""
"x83","“What depth have we?” asked the captain."
"x83",""
"x83","“Three thousand six hundred and twenty-seven fathoms,” replied the"
"x83","lieutenant, entering it in his notebook."
"x83",""
"x83","“Well, Bronsfield,” said the captain, “I will take down the result. Now"
"x83","haul in the sounding line. It will be the work of some hours. In that"
"x83","time the engineer can light the furnaces, and we shall be ready to"
"x83","start as soon as you have finished. It is ten o’clock, and with your"
"x83","permission, lieutenant, I will turn in.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Do so, sir; do so!” replied the lieutenant obligingly."
"x83",""
"x83","The captain of the Susquehanna, as brave a man as need be, and the"
"x83","humble servant of his officers, returned to his cabin, took a"
"x83","brandy-grog, which earned for the steward no end of praise, and turned"
"x83","in, not without having complimented his servant upon his making beds,"
"x83","and slept a peaceful sleep."
"x83",""
"x83","It was then ten at night. The eleventh day of the month of December was"
"x83","drawing to a close in a magnificent night."
"x83",""
"x83","The Susquehanna, a corvette of 500 horse-power, of the United States"
"x83","navy, was occupied in taking soundings in the Pacific Ocean about 200"
"x83","miles off the American coast, following that long peninsula which"
"x83","stretches down the coast of Mexico."
"x83",""
"x83","The wind had dropped by degrees. There was no disturbance in the air."
"x83","The pennant hung motionless from the maintop-gallant- mast truck."
"x83",""
"x83","Captain Jonathan Blomsberry (cousin-german of Colonel Blomsberry, one"
"x83","of the most ardent supporters of the Gun Club, who had married an aunt"
"x83","of the captain and daughter of an honorable Kentucky merchant)—Captain"
"x83","Blomsberry could not have wished for finer weather in which to bring to"
"x83","a close his delicate operations of sounding. His corvette had not even"
"x83","felt the great tempest, which by sweeping away the groups of clouds on"
"x83","the Rocky Mountains, had allowed them to observe the course of the"
"x83","famous projectile."
"x83",""
"x83","Everything went well, and with all the fervor of a Presbyterian, he did"
"x83","not forget to thank heaven for it. The series of soundings taken by the"
"x83","Susquehanna, had for its aim the finding of a favorable spot for the"
"x83","laying of a submarine cable to connect the Hawaiian Islands with the"
"x83","coast of America."
"x83",""
"x83","It was a great undertaking, due to the instigation of a powerful"
"x83","company. Its managing director, the intelligent Cyrus Field, purposed"
"x83","even covering all the islands of Oceanica with a vast electrical"
"x83","network, an immense enterprise, and one worthy of American genius."
"x83",""
"x83","To the corvette Susquehanna had been confided the first operations of"
"x83","sounding. It was on the night of the 11th-12th of December, she was in"
"x83","exactly 27° 7′ north latitude, and 41° 37′ west longitude, on the"
"x83","meridian of Washington."
"x83",""
"x83","The moon, then in her last quarter, was beginning to rise above the"
"x83","horizon."
"x83",""
"x83","After the departure of Captain Blomsberry, the lieutenant and some"
"x83","officers were standing together on the poop. On the appearance of the"
"x83","moon, their thoughts turned to that orb which the eyes of a whole"
"x83","hemisphere were contemplating. The best naval glasses could not have"
"x83","discovered the projectile wandering around its hemisphere, and yet all"
"x83","were pointed toward that brilliant disc which millions of eyes were"
"x83","looking at at the same moment."
"x83",""
"x83","“They have been gone ten days,” said Lieutenant Bronsfield at last."
"x83","“What has become of them?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“They have arrived, lieutenant,” exclaimed a young midshipman, “and"
"x83","they are doing what all travelers do when they arrive in a new country,"
"x83","taking a walk!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Oh! I am sure of that, if you tell me so, my young friend,” said"
"x83","Lieutenant Bronsfield, smiling."
"x83",""
"x83","“But,” continued another officer, “their arrival cannot be doubted. The"
"x83","projectile was to reach the moon when full on the 5th at midnight. We"
"x83","are now at the 11th of December, which makes six days. And in six times"
"x83","twenty-four hours, without darkness, one would have time to settle"
"x83","comfortably. I fancy I see my brave countrymen encamped at the bottom"
"x83","of some valley, on the borders of a Selenite stream, near a projectile"
"x83","half-buried by its fall amid volcanic rubbish, Captain Nicholl"
"x83","beginning his leveling operations, President Barbicane writing out his"
"x83","notes, and Michel Ardan embalming the lunar solitudes with the perfume"
"x83","of his—”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes! it must be so, it is so!” exclaimed the young midshipman, worked"
"x83","up to a pitch of enthusiasm by this ideal description of his superior"
"x83","officer."
"x83",""
"x83","“I should like to believe it,” replied the lieutenant, who was quite"
"x83","unmoved. “Unfortunately direct news from the lunar world is still"
"x83","wanting.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Beg pardon, lieutenant,” said the midshipman, “but cannot President"
"x83","Barbicane write?”"
"x83",""
"x83","A burst of laughter greeted this answer."
"x83",""
"x83","“No letters!” continued the young man quickly. “The postal"
"x83","administration has something to see to there.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Might it not be the telegraphic service that is at fault?” asked one"
"x83","of the officers ironically."
"x83",""
"x83","“Not necessarily,” replied the midshipman, not at all confused. “But it"
"x83","is very easy to set up a graphic communication with the earth.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“And how?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“By means of the telescope at Long’s Peak. You know it brings the moon"
"x83","to within four miles of the Rocky Mountains, and that it shows objects"
"x83","on its surface of only nine feet in diameter. Very well; let our"
"x83","industrious friends construct a giant alphabet; let them write words"
"x83","three fathoms long, and sentences three miles long, and then they can"
"x83","send us news of themselves.”"
"x83",""
"x83","The young midshipman, who had a certain amount of imagination, was"
"x83","loudly applauded; Lieutenant Bronsfield allowing that the idea was"
"x83","possible, but observing that if by these means they could receive news"
"x83","from the lunar world they could not send any from the terrestrial,"
"x83","unless the Selenites had instruments fit for taking distant"
"x83","observations at their disposal."
"x83",""
"x83","“Evidently,” said one of the officers; “but what has become of the"
"x83","travelers? what they have done, what they have seen, that above all"
"x83","must interest us. Besides, if the experiment has succeeded (which I do"
"x83","not doubt), they will try it again. The Columbiad is still sunk in the"
"x83","soil of Florida. It is now only a question of powder and shot; and"
"x83","every time the moon is at her zenith a cargo of visitors may be sent to"
"x83","her.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“It is clear,” replied Lieutenant Bronsfield, “that J. T. Maston will"
"x83","one day join his friends.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“If he will have me,” cried the midshipman, “I am ready!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Oh! volunteers will not be wanting,” answered Bronsfield; “and if it"
"x83","were allowed, half of the earth’s inhabitants would emigrate to the"
"x83","moon!”"
"x83",""
"x83","This conversation between the officers of the Susquehanna was kept up"
"x83","until nearly one in the morning. We cannot say what blundering systems"
"x83","were broached, what inconsistent theories advanced by these bold"
"x83","spirits. Since Barbicane’s attempt, nothing seemed impossible to the"
"x83","Americans. They had already designed an expedition, not only of"
"x83","savants, but of a whole colony toward the Selenite borders, and a"
"x83","complete army, consisting of infantry, artillery, and cavalry, to"
"x83","conquer the lunar world."
"x83",""
"x83","At one in the morning, the hauling in of the sounding-line was not yet"
"x83","completed; 1,670 fathoms were still out, which would entail some hours’"
"x83","work. According to the commander’s orders, the fires had been lighted,"
"x83","and steam was being got up. The Susquehanna could have started that"
"x83","very instant."
"x83",""
"x83","At that moment (it was seventeen minutes past one in the morning)"
"x83","Lieutenant Bronsfield was preparing to leave the watch and return to"
"x83","his cabin, when his attention was attracted by a distant hissing noise."
"x83","His comrades and himself first thought that this hissing was caused by"
"x83","the letting off of steam; but lifting their heads, they found that the"
"x83","noise was produced in the highest regions of the air. They had not time"
"x83","to question each other before the hissing became frightfully intense,"
"x83","and suddenly there appeared to their dazzled eyes an enormous meteor,"
"x83","ignited by the rapidity of its course and its friction through the"
"x83","atmospheric strata."
"x83",""
"x83","This fiery mass grew larger to their eyes, and fell, with the noise of"
"x83","thunder, upon the bowsprit, which it smashed close to the stem, and"
"x83","buried itself in the waves with a deafening roar!"
"x83",""
"x83","A few feet nearer, and the Susquehanna would have foundered with all on"
"x83","board!"
"x83",""
"x83","At this instant Captain Blomsberry appeared, half-dressed, and rushing"
"x83","on to the forecastle-deck, whither all the officers had hurried,"
"x83","exclaimed, “With your permission, gentlemen, what has happened?”"
"x83",""
"x83","And the midshipman, making himself as it were the echo of the body,"

"x83","J. T. MASTON RECALLED"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","“It is ‘they’ come back again!” the young midshipman had said, and"
"x83","every one had understood him. No one doubted but that the meteor was"
"x83","the projectile of the Gun Club. As to the travelers which it enclosed,"
"x83","opinions were divided regarding their fate."
"x83",""
"x83","“They are dead!” said one."
"x83",""
"x83","“They are alive!” said another; “the crater is deep, and the shock was"
"x83","deadened.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“But they must have wanted air,” continued a third speaker; “they must"
"x83","have died of suffocation.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Burned!” replied a fourth; “the projectile was nothing but an"
"x83","incandescent mass as it crossed the atmosphere.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“What does it matter!” they exclaimed unanimously; “living or dead, we"
"x83","must pull them out!”"
"x83",""
"x83","But Captain Blomsberry had assembled his officers, and “with their"
"x83","permission,” was holding a council. They must decide upon something to"
"x83","be done immediately. The more hasty ones were for fishing up the"
"x83","projectile. A difficult operation, though not an impossible one. But"
"x83","the corvette had no proper machinery, which must be both fixed and"
"x83","powerful; so it was resolved that they should put in at the nearest"
"x83","port, and give information to the Gun Club of the projectile’s fall."
"x83",""
"x83","This determination was unanimous. The choice of the port had to be"
"x83","discussed. The neighboring coast had no anchorage on 27° latitude."
"x83","Higher up, above the peninsula of Monterey, stands the important town"
"x83","from which it takes its name; but, seated on the borders of a perfect"
"x83","desert, it was not connected with the interior by a network of"
"x83","telegraphic wires, and electricity alone could spread these important"
"x83","news fast enough."
"x83",""
"x83","Some degrees above opened the bay of San Francisco. Through the capital"
"x83","of the gold country communication would be easy with the heart of the"
"x83","Union. And in less than two days the Susquehanna, by putting on high"
"x83","pressure, could arrive in that port. She must therefore start at once."
"x83",""
"x83","The fires were made up; they could set off immediately. Two thousand"
"x83","fathoms of line were still out, which Captain Blomsberry, not wishing"
"x83","to lose precious time in hauling in, resolved to cut."
"x83",""
"x83","“we will fasten the end to a buoy,” said he, “and that buoy will show"
"x83","us the exact spot where the projectile fell.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Besides,” replied Lieutenant Bronsfield, “we have our situation"
"x83","exact—27° 7′ north latitude and 41° 37′ west longitude.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Well, Mr. Bronsfield,” replied the captain, “now, with your"
"x83","permission, we will have the line cut.”"
"x83",""
"x83","A strong buoy, strengthened by a couple of spars, was thrown into the"
"x83","ocean. The end of the rope was carefully lashed to it; and, left solely"
"x83","to the rise and fall of the billows, the buoy would not sensibly"
"x83","deviate from the spot."
"x83",""
"x83","At this moment the engineer sent to inform the captain that steam was"
"x83","up and they could start, for which agreeable communication the captain"
"x83","thanked him. The course was then given north-northeast, and the"
"x83","corvette, wearing, steered at full steam direct for San Francisco. It"
"x83","was three in the morning."
"x83",""
"x83","Four hundred and fifty miles to cross; it was nothing for a good vessel"
"x83","like the Susquehanna. In thirty-six hours she had covered that"
"x83","distance; and on the 14th of December, at twenty-seven minutes past one"
"x83","at night, she entered the bay of San Francisco."
"x83",""
"x83","At the sight of a ship of the national navy arriving at full speed,"
"x83","with her bowsprit broken, public curiosity was greatly roused. A dense"
"x83","crowd soon assembled on the quay, waiting for them to disembark."
"x83",""
"x83","After casting anchor, Captain Blomsberry and Lieutenant Bronsfield"
"x83","entered an eight-pared cutter, which soon brought them to land."
"x83",""
"x83","They jumped on to the quay."
"x83",""
"x83","“The telegraph?” they asked, without answering one of the thousand"
"x83","questions addressed to them."
"x83",""
"x83","The officer of the port conducted them to the telegraph office through"
"x83","a concourse of spectators. Blomsberry and Bronsfield entered, while the"
"x83","crowd crushed each other at the door."
"x83",""
"x83","Some minutes later a fourfold telegram was sent out—the first to the"

"x83","Gun Club, Baltimore; the third to the Hon. J. T. Maston, Long’s Peak,"
"x83","Rocky Mountains; and the fourth to the sub-director of the Cambridge"

"x83","It was worded as follows:"
"x83",""
"x83","In 20° 7′ north latitude, and 41° 37′ west longitude, on the 12th of"
"x83","December, at seventeen minutes past one in the morning, the projectile"
"x83","of the Columbiad fell into the Pacific. Send instructions.—BLOMSBERRY,"
"x83","Commander Susquehanna."
"x83",""
"x83","Five minutes afterward the whole town of San Francisco learned the"
"x83","news. Before six in the evening the different States of the Union had"
"x83","heard the great catastrophe; and after midnight, by the cable, the"
"x83","whole of Europe knew the result of the great American experiment. We"
"x83","will not attempt to picture the effect produced on the entire world by"
"x83","that unexpected denouement."
"x83",""
"x83","On receipt of the telegram the Naval Secretary telegraphed to the"
"x83","Susquehanna to wait in the bay of San Francisco without extinguishing"
"x83","her fires. Day and night she must be ready to put to sea."
"x83",""
"x83","The Cambridge observatory called a special meeting; and, with that"
"x83","composure which distinguishes learned bodies in general, peacefully"
"x83","discussed the scientific bearings of the question. At the Gun Club"
"x83","there was an explosion. All the gunners were assembled. Vice-President"
"x83","the Hon. Wilcome was in the act of reading the premature dispatch, in"
"x83","which J. T. Maston and Belfast announced that the projectile had just"
"x83","been seen in the gigantic reflector of Long’s Peak, and also that it"
"x83","was held by lunar attraction, and was playing the part of under"
"x83","satellite to the lunar world."
"x83",""
"x83","We know the truth on that point."
"x83",""
"x83","But on the arrival of Blomsberry’s dispatch, so decidely contradicting"
"x83","J. T. Maston’s telegram, two parties were formed in the bosom of the"
"x83","Gun Club. On one side were those who admitted the fall of the"
"x83","projectile, and consequently the return of the travelers; on the other,"
"x83","those who believed in the observations of Long’s Peak, concluded that"
"x83","the commander of the Susquehanna had made a mistake. To the latter the"
"x83","pretended projectile was nothing but a meteor! nothing but a meteor, a"
"x83","shooting globe, which in its fall had smashed the bows of the corvette."
"x83","It was difficult to answer this argument, for the speed with which it"
"x83","was animated must have made observation very difficult. The commander"
"x83","of the Susquehanna and her officers might have made a mistake in all"
"x83","good faith; one argument however, was in their favor, namely, that if"
"x83","the projectile had fallen on the earth, its place of meeting with the"
"x83","terrestrial globe could only take place on this 27° north latitude, and"
"x83","(taking into consideration the time that had elapsed, and the rotary"
"x83","motion of the earth) between the 41° and the 42° of west longitude. In"
"x83","any case, it was decided in the Gun Club that Blomsberry brothers,"
"x83","Bilsby, and Major Elphinstone should go straight to San Francisco, and"
"x83","consult as to the means of raising the projectile from the depths of"
"x83","the ocean."
"x83",""
"x83","These devoted men set off at once; and the railroad, which will soon"
"x83","cross the whole of Central America, took them as far as St. Louis,"
"x83","where the swift mail-coaches awaited them. Almost at the same moment in"
"x83","which the Secretary of Marine, the vice-president of the Gun Club, and"
"x83","the sub-director of the Observatory received the dispatch from San"
"x83","Francisco, the Honorable J. T. Maston was undergoing the greatest"
"x83","excitement he had ever experienced in his life, an excitement which"
"x83","even the bursting of his pet gun, which had more than once nearly cost"
"x83","him his life, had not caused him. We may remember that the secretary of"
"x83","the Gun Club had started soon after the projectile (and almost as"
"x83","quickly) for the station on Long’s Peak, in the Rocky Mountains, J."
"x83","Belfast, director of the Cambridge Observatory, accompanying him."
"x83","Arrived there, the two friends had installed themselves at once, never"
"x83","quitting the summit of their enormous telescope. We know that this"
"x83","gigantic instrument had been set up according to the reflecting system,"
"x83","called by the English “front view.” This arrangement subjected all"
"x83","objects to but one reflection, making the view consequently much"
"x83","clearer; the result was that, when they were taking observation, J. T."
"x83","Maston and Belfast were placed in the _upper_ part of the instrument"
"x83","and not in the lower, which they reached by a circular staircase, a"
"x83","masterpiece of lightness, while below them opened a metal well"
"x83","terminated by the metallic mirror, which measured two hundred and"
"x83","eighty feet in depth."
"x83",""
"x83","It was on a narrow platform placed above the telescope that the two"
"x83","savants passed their existence, execrating the day which hid the moon"
"x83","from their eyes, and the clouds which obstinately veiled her during the"
"x83","night."
"x83",""
"x83","What, then, was their delight when, after some days of waiting, on the"
"x83","night of the 5th of December, they saw the vehicle which was bearing"
"x83","their friends into space! To this delight succeeded a great deception,"
"x83","when, trusting to a cursory observation, they launched their first"
"x83","telegram to the world, erroneously affirming that the projectile had"
"x83","become a satellite of the moon, gravitating in an immutable orbit."
"x83",""
"x83","From that moment it had never shown itself to their eyes—a"
"x83","disappearance all the more easily explained, as it was then passing"
"x83","behind the moon’s invisible disc; but when it was time for it to"
"x83","reappear on the visible disc, one may imagine the impatience of the"
"x83","fuming J. T. Maston and his not less impatient companion. Each minute"
"x83","of the night they thought they saw the projectile once more, and they"
"x83","did not see it. Hence constant discussions and violent disputes between"
"x83","them, Belfast affirming that the projectile could not be seen, J. T."
"x83","Maston maintaining that “it had put his eyes out.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“It is the projectile!” repeated J. T. Maston."
"x83",""
"x83","“No,” answered Belfast; “it is an avalanche detached from a lunar"
"x83","mountain.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Well, we shall see it to-morrow.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“No, we shall not see it any more. It is carried into space.”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“No!”"
"x83",""
"x83","And at these moments, when contradictions rained like hail, the"
"x83","well-known irritability of the secretary of the Gun Club constituted a"
"x83","permanent danger for the Honorable Belfast. The existence of these two"
"x83","together would soon have become impossible; but an unforseen event cut"
"x83","short their everlasting discussions."
"x83",""
"x83","During the night, from the 14th to the 15th of December, the two"
"x83","irreconcilable friends were busy observing the lunar disc, J. T. Maston"
"x83","abusing the learned Belfast as usual, who was by his side; the"
"x83","secretary of the Gun Club maintaining for the thousandth time that he"
"x83","had just seen the projectile, and adding that he could see Michel"
"x83","Ardan’s face looking through one of the scuttles, at the same time"
"x83","enforcing his argument by a series of gestures which his formidable"
"x83","hook rendered very unpleasant."
"x83",""
"x83","At this moment Belfast’s servant appeared on the platform (it was ten"
"x83","at night) and gave him a dispatch. It was the commander of the"
"x83","Susquehanna’s telegram."
"x83",""
"x83","Belfast tore the envelope and read, and uttered a cry."
"x83",""
"x83","“What!” said J. T. Maston."
"x83",""
"x83","“The projectile!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Well!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Has fallen to the earth!”"
"x83",""
"x83","Another cry, this time a perfect howl, answered him. He turned toward"
"x83","J. T. Maston. The unfortunate man, imprudently leaning over the metal"
"x83","tube, had disappeared in the immense telescope. A fall of two hundred"
"x83","and eighty feet! Belfast, dismayed, rushed to the orifice of the"
"x83","reflector."
"x83",""
"x83","He breathed. J. T. Maston, caught by his metal hook, was holding on by"
"x83","one of the rings which bound the telescope together, uttering fearful"
"x83","cries."
"x83",""
"x83","Belfast called. Help was brought, tackle was let down, and they hoisted"
"x83","up, not without some trouble, the imprudent secretary of the Gun Club."
"x83",""
"x83","He reappeared at the upper orifice without hurt."
"x83",""
"x83","“Ah!” said he, “if I had broken the mirror?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“You would have paid for it,” replied Belfast severely."
"x83",""
"x83","“And that cursed projectile has fallen?” asked J. T. Maston."
"x83",""
"x83","“Into the Pacific!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Let us go!”"
"x83",""
"x83","A quarter of an hour after the two savants were descending the"
"x83","declivity of the Rocky Mountains; and two days after, at the same time"
"x83","as their friends of the Gun Club, they arrived at San Francisco, having"
"x83","killed five horses on the road."
"x83",""
"x83","Elphinstone, the brothers Blomsberry, and Bilsby rushed toward them on"
"x83","their arrival."
"x83",""
"x83","“What shall we do?” they exclaimed."

"x83","CHAPTER XXII."
"x83","RECOVERED FROM THE SEA"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","The spot where the projectile sank under the waves was exactly known;"
"x83","but the machinery to grasp it and bring it to the surface of the ocean"
"x83","was still wanting. It must first be invented, then made. American"
"x83","engineers could not be troubled with such trifles. The grappling-irons"
"x83","once fixed, by their help they were sure to raise it in spite of its"
"x83","weight, which was lessened by the density of the liquid in which it was"
"x83","plunged."
"x83",""
"x83","But fishing-up the projectile was not the only thing to be thought of."
"x83","They must act promptly in the interest of the travelers. No one doubted"
"x83","that they were still living."
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes,” repeated J. T. Maston incessantly, whose confidence gained over"
"x83","everybody, “our friends are clever people, and they cannot have fallen"
"x83","like simpletons. They are alive, quite alive; but we must make haste if"
"x83","we wish to find them so. Food and water do not trouble me; they have"
"x83","enough for a long while. But air, air, that is what they will soon"
"x83","want; so quick, quick!”"
"x83",""
"x83","And they did go quick. They fitted up the Susquehanna for her new"
"x83","destination. Her powerful machinery was brought to bear upon the"
"x83","hauling-chains. The aluminum projectile only weighed 19,250 pounds, a"
"x83","weight very inferior to that of the transatlantic cable which had been"
"x83","drawn up under similar conditions. The only difficulty was in fishing"
"x83","up a cylindro-conical projectile, the walls of which were so smooth as"
"x83","to offer no hold for the hooks. On that account Engineer Murchison"
"x83","hastened to San Francisco, and had some enormous grappling-irons fixed"
"x83","on an automatic system, which would never let the projectile go if it"
"x83","once succeeded in seizing it in its powerful claws. Diving-dresses were"
"x83","also prepared, which through this impervious covering allowed the"
"x83","divers to observe the bottom of the sea. He also had put on board an"
"x83","apparatus of compressed air very cleverly designed. There were perfect"
"x83","chambers pierced with scuttles, which, with water let into certain"
"x83","compartments, could draw it down into great depths. These apparatuses"
"x83","were at San Francisco, where they had been used in the construction of"
"x83","a submarine breakwater; and very fortunately it was so, for there was"
"x83","no time to construct any. But in spite of the perfection of the"
"x83","machinery, in spite of the ingenuity of the savants entrusted with the"
"x83","use of them, the success of the operation was far from being certain."
"x83","How great were the chances against them, the projectile being 20,000"
"x83","feet under the water! And if even it was brought to the surface, how"
"x83","would the travelers have borne the terrible shock which 20,000 feet of"
"x83","water had perhaps not sufficiently broken? At any rate they must act"
"x83","quickly. J. T. Maston hurried the workmen day and night. He was ready"
"x83","to don the diving-dress himself, or try the air apparatus, in order to"
"x83","reconnoiter the situation of his courageous friends."
"x83",""
"x83","But in spite of all the diligence displayed in preparing the different"
"x83","engines, in spite of the considerable sum placed at the disposal of the"
"x83","Gun Club by the Government of the Union, five long days (five"
"x83","centuries!) elapsed before the preparations were complete. During this"
"x83","time public opinion was excited to the highest pitch. Telegrams were"
"x83","exchanged incessantly throughout the entire world by means of wires and"
"x83","electric cables. The saving of Barbicane, Nicholl, and Michel Ardan was"
"x83","an international affair. Every one who had subscribed to the Gun Club"
"x83","was directly interested in the welfare of the travelers."
"x83",""
"x83","At length the hauling-chains, the air-chambers, and the automatic"
"x83","grappling-irons were put on board. J. T. Maston, Engineer Murchison,"
"x83","and the delegates of the Gun Club, were already in their cabins. They"
"x83","had but to start, which they did on the 21st of December, at eight"
"x83","o’clock at night, the corvette meeting with a beautiful sea, a"
"x83","northeasterly wind, and rather sharp cold. The whole population of San"
"x83","Francisco was gathered on the quay, greatly excited but silent,"
"x83","reserving their hurrahs for the return. Steam was fully up, and the"
"x83","screw of the Susquehanna carried them briskly out of the bay."
"x83",""
"x83","It is needless to relate the conversations on board between the"
"x83","officers, sailors, and passengers. All these men had but one thought."
"x83","All these hearts beat under the same emotion. While they were hastening"
"x83","to help them, what were Barbicane and his companions doing? What had"
"x83","become of them? Were they able to attempt any bold maneuver to regain"
"x83","their liberty? None could say. The truth is that every attempt must"
"x83","have failed! Immersed nearly four miles under the ocean, this metal"
"x83","prison defied every effort of its prisoners."
"x83",""
"x83","On the 23rd inst., at eight in the morning, after a rapid passage, the"
"x83","Susquehanna was due at the fatal spot. They must wait till twelve to"
"x83","take the reckoning exactly. The buoy to which the sounding line had"
"x83","been lashed had not yet been recognized."
"x83",""
"x83","At twelve, Captain Blomsberry, assisted by his officers who"
"x83","superintended the observations, took the reckoning in the presence of"
"x83","the delegates of the Gun Club. Then there was a moment of anxiety. Her"
"x83","position decided, the Susquehanna was found to be some minutes westward"
"x83","of the spot where the projectile had disappeared beneath the waves."
"x83",""
"x83","The ship’s course was then changed so as to reach this exact point."
"x83",""
"x83","At forty-seven minutes past twelve they reached the buoy; it was in"
"x83","perfect condition, and must have shifted but little."
"x83",""
"x83","“At last!” exclaimed J. T. Maston."
"x83",""
"x83","“Shall we begin?” asked Captain Blomsberry."
"x83",""
"x83","“Without losing a second.”"
"x83",""
"x83","Every precaution was taken to keep the corvette almost completely"
"x83","motionless. Before trying to seize the projectile, Engineer Murchison"
"x83","wanted to find its exact position at the bottom of the ocean. The"
"x83","submarine apparatus destined for this expedition was supplied with air."
"x83","The working of these engines was not without danger, for at 20,000 feet"
"x83","below the surface of the water, and under such great pressure, they"
"x83","were exposed to fracture, the consequences of which would be dreadful."
"x83",""
"x83","J. T. Maston, the brothers Blomsberry, and Engineer Murchison, without"
"x83","heeding these dangers, took their places in the air-chamber. The"
"x83","commander, posted on his bridge, superintended the operation, ready to"
"x83","stop or haul in the chains on the slightest signal. The screw had been"
"x83","shipped, and the whole power of the machinery collected on the capstan"
"x83","would have quickly drawn the apparatus on board. The descent began at"
"x83","twenty-five minutes past one at night, and the chamber, drawn under by"
"x83","the reservoirs full of water, disappeared from the surface of the"
"x83","ocean."
"x83",""
"x83","The emotion of the officers and sailors on board was now divided"
"x83","between the prisoners in the projectile and the prisoners in the"
"x83","submarine apparatus. As to the latter, they forgot themselves, and,"
"x83","glued to the windows of the scuttles, attentively watched the liquid"
"x83","mass through which they were passing."
"x83",""
"x83","The descent was rapid. At seventeen minutes past two, J. T. Maston and"
"x83","his companions had reached the bottom of the Pacific; but they saw"
"x83","nothing but an arid desert, no longer animated by either fauna or"
"x83","flora. By the light of their lamps, furnished with powerful reflectors,"
"x83","they could see the dark beds of the ocean for a considerable extent of"
"x83","view, but the projectile was nowhere to be seen."
"x83",""
"x83","The impatience of these bold divers cannot be described, and having an"
"x83","electrical communication with the corvette, they made a signal already"
"x83","agreed upon, and for the space of a mile the Susquehanna moved their"
"x83","chamber along some yards above the bottom."
"x83",""
"x83","Thus they explored the whole submarine plain, deceived at every turn by"
"x83","optical illusions which almost broke their hearts. Here a rock, there a"
"x83","projection from the ground, seemed to be the much-sought-for"
"x83","projectile; but their mistake was soon discovered, and then they were"
"x83","in despair."
"x83",""
"x83","“But where are they? where are they?” cried J. T. Maston. And the poor"
"x83","man called loudly upon Nicholl, Barbicane, and Michel Ardan, as if his"
"x83","unfortunate friends could either hear or answer him through such an"
"x83","impenetrable medium! The search continued under these conditions until"
"x83","the vitiated air compelled the divers to ascend."
"x83",""
"x83","The hauling in began about six in the evening, and was not ended before"
"x83","midnight."
"x83",""
"x83","“To-morrow,” said J. T. Maston, as he set foot on the bridge of the"
"x83","corvette."
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes,” answered Captain Blomsberry."
"x83",""
"x83","“And on another spot?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Yes.”"
"x83",""
"x83","J. T. Maston did not doubt of their final success, but his companions,"
"x83","no longer upheld by the excitement of the first hours, understood all"
"x83","the difficulty of the enterprise. What seemed easy at San Francisco,"
"x83","seemed here in the wide ocean almost impossible. The chances of success"
"x83","diminished in rapid proportion; and it was from chance alone that the"
"x83","meeting with the projectile might be expected."
"x83",""
"x83","The next day, the 24th, in spite of the fatigue of the previous day,"
"x83","the operation was renewed. The corvette advanced some minutes to"
"x83","westward, and the apparatus, provided with air, bore the same explorers"
"x83","to the depths of the ocean."
"x83",""
"x83","The whole day passed in fruitless research; the bed of the sea was a"
"x83","desert. The 25th brought no other result, nor the 26th."
"x83",""
"x83","It was disheartening. They thought of those unfortunates shut up in the"
"x83","projectile for twenty-six days. Perhaps at that moment they were"
"x83","experiencing the first approach of suffocation; that is, if they had"
"x83","escaped the dangers of their fall. The air was spent, and doubtless"
"x83","with the air all their _morale_."
"x83",""
"x83","“The air, possibly,” answered J. T. Maston resolutely, “but their"
"x83","_morale_ never!”"
"x83",""
"x83","On the 28th, after two more days of search, all hope was gone. This"
"x83","projectile was but an atom in the immensity of the ocean. They must"
"x83","give up all idea of finding it."
"x83",""
"x83","But J. T. Maston would not hear of going away. He would not abandon the"
"x83","place without at least discovering the tomb of his friends. But"
"x83","Commander Blomsberry could no longer persist, and in spite of the"
"x83","exclamations of the worthy secretary, was obliged to give the order to"
"x83","sail."
"x83",""
"x83","On the 29th of December, at nine A.M., the Susquehanna, heading"
"x83","northeast, resumed her course to the bay of San Francisco."
"x83",""
"x83","It was ten in the morning; the corvette was under half-steam, as it was"
"x83","regretting to leave the spot where the catastrophe had taken place,"
"x83","when a sailor, perched on the main-top-gallant crosstrees, watching the"
"x83","sea, cried suddenly:"
"x83",""
"x83","“A buoy on the lee bow!”"
"x83",""
"x83","The officers looked in the direction indicated, and by the help of"
"x83","their glasses saw that the object signalled had the appearance of one"
"x83","of those buoys which are used to mark the passages of bays or rivers."
"x83","But, singularly to say, a flag floating on the wind surmounted its"
"x83","cone, which emerged five or six feet out of water. This buoy shone"
"x83","under the rays of the sun as if it had been made of plates of silver."
"x83","Commander Blomsberry, J. T. Maston, and the delegates of the Gun Club"
"x83","were mounted on the bridge, examining this object straying at random on"
"x83","the waves."
"x83",""
"x83","All looked with feverish anxiety, but in silence. None dared give"
"x83","expression to the thoughts which came to the minds of all."
"x83",""
"x83","The corvette approached to within two cables’ lengths of the object."
"x83",""
"x83","A shudder ran through the whole crew. That flag was the American flag!"
"x83",""
"x83","At this moment a perfect howling was heard; it was the brave J. T."
"x83","Maston who had just fallen all in a heap. Forgetting on the one hand"
"x83","that his right arm had been replaced by an iron hook, and on the other"
"x83","that a simple gutta-percha cap covered his brain-box, he had given"
"x83","himself a formidable blow."
"x83",""
"x83","They hurried toward him, picked him up, restored him to life. And what"
"x83","were his first words?"
"x83",""
"x83","“Ah! trebly brutes! quadruply idiots! quintuply boobies that we are!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“What is it?” exclaimed everyone around him."
"x83",""
"x83","“What is it?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Come, speak!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“It is, simpletons,” howled the terrible secretary, “it is that the"
"x83","projectile only weighs 19,250 pounds!”"
"x83",""
"x83","“Well?”"
"x83",""
"x83","“And that it displaces twenty-eight tons, or in other words 56,000"
"x83","pounds, and that consequently _it floats_!”"
"x83",""
"x83","Ah! what stress the worthy man had laid on the verb “float!” And it was"
"x83","true! All, yes! all these savants had forgotten this fundamental law,"
"x83","namely, that on account of its specific lightness, the projectile,"
"x83","after having been drawn by its fall to the greatest depths of the"
"x83","ocean, must naturally return to the surface. And now it was floating"
"x83","quietly at the mercy of the waves."
"x83",""
"x83","The boats were put to sea. J. T. Maston and his friends had rushed into"
"x83","them! Excitement was at its height! Every heart beat loudly while they"
"x83","advanced to the projectile. What did it contain? Living or dead?"
"x83",""
"x83","Living, yes! living, at least unless death had struck Barbicane and his"
"x83","two friends since they had hoisted the flag. Profound silence reigned"
"x83","on the boats. All were breathless. Eyes no longer saw. One of the"
"x83","scuttles of the projectile was open. Some pieces of glass remained in"
"x83","the frame, showing that it had been broken. This scuttle was actually"
"x83","five feet above the water."
"x83",""
"x83","A boat came alongside, that of J. T. Maston, and J. T. Maston rushed to"
"x83","the broken window."

"x83","At that moment they heard a clear and merry voice, the voice of Michel"

"x83","CHAPTER XXIII."
"x83","THE END"
"x83",""
"x83",""
"x83","We may remember the intense sympathy which had accompanied the"
"x83","travelers on their departure. If at the beginning of the enterprise"
"x83","they had excited such emotion both in the old and new world, with what"
"x83","enthusiasm would they be received on their return! The millions of"
"x83","spectators which had beset the peninsula of Florida, would they not"
"x83","rush to meet these sublime adventurers? Those legions of strangers,"
"x83","hurrying from all parts of the globe toward the American shores, would"
"x83","they leave the Union without having seen Barbicane, Nicholl, and Michel"
"x83","Ardan? No! and the ardent passion of the public was bound to respond"
"x83","worthily to the greatness of the enterprise. Human creatures who had"
"x83","left the terrestrial sphere, and returned after this strange voyage"
"x83","into celestial space, could not fail to be received as the prophet"
"x83","Elias would be if he came back to earth. To see them first, and then to"
"x83","hear them, such was the universal longing."
"x83",""
"x83","Barbicane, Michel Ardan, Nicholl, and the delegates of the Gun Club,"
"x83","returning without delay to Baltimore, were received with indescribable"
"x83","enthusiasm. The notes of President Barbicane’s voyage were ready to be"
"x83","given to the public. The New York _Herald_ bought the manuscript at a"
"x83","price not yet known, but which must have been very high. Indeed, during"
"x83","the publication of “A Journey to the Moon,” the sale of this paper"
"x83","amounted to five millions of copies. Three days after the return of the"
"x83","travelers to the earth, the slightest detail of their expedition was"
"x83","known. There remained nothing more but to see the heroes of this"
"x83","superhuman enterprise."
"x83",""
"x83","The expedition of Barbicane and his friends round the moon had enabled"
"x83","them to correct the many admitted theories regarding the terrestrial"
"x83","satellite. These savants had observed _de visu_, and under particular"
"x83","circumstances. They knew what systems should be rejected, what retained"
"x83","with regard to the formation of that orb, its origin, its habitability."
"x83","Its past, present, and future had even given up their last secrets. Who"
"x83","could advance objections against conscientious observers, who at less"
"x83","than twenty-four miles distance had marked that curious mountain of"
"x83","Tycho, the strangest system of lunar orography? How answer those"
"x83","savants whose sight had penetrated the abyss of Pluto’s circle? How"
"x83","contradict those bold ones whom the chances of their enterprise had"
"x83","borne over that invisible face of the disc, which no human eye until"
"x83","then had ever seen? It was now their turn to impose some limit on that"
"x83","selenographic science, which had reconstructed the lunar world as"
"x83","Cuvier did the skeleton of a fossil, and say, “The moon _was_ this, a"
"x83","habitable world, inhabited before the earth. The moon _is_ that, a"
"x83","world uninhabitable, and now uninhabited.”"
"x83",""
"x83","To celebrate the return of its most illustrious member and his two"
"x83","companions, the Gun Club decided upon giving a banquet, but a banquet"
"x83","worthy of the conquerors, worthy of the American people, and under such"
"x83","conditions that all the inhabitants of the Union could directly take"
"x83","part in it."
"x83",""
"x83","All the head lines of railroads in the States were joined by flying"
"x83","rails; and on all the platforms, lined with the same flags, and"
"x83","decorated with the same ornaments, were tables laid and all served"
"x83","alike. At certain hours, successively calculated, marked by electric"
"x83","clocks which beat the seconds at the same time, the population were"
"x83","invited to take their places at the banquet tables. For four days, from"
"x83","the 5th to the 9th of January, the trains were stopped as they are on"
"x83","Sundays on the railways of the United States, and every road was open."
"x83","One engine only at full speed, drawing a triumphal carriage, had the"
"x83","right of traveling for those four days on the railroads of the United"
"x83","States."
"x83",""
"x83","The engine was manned by a driver and a stoker, and bore, by special"
"x83","favor, the Hon. J. T. Maston, secretary of the Gun Club. The carriage"
"x83","was reserved for President Barbicane, Colonel Nicholl, and Michel"
"x83","Ardan. At the whistle of the driver, amid the hurrahs, and all the"
"x83","admiring vociferations of the American language, the train left the"
"x83","platform of Baltimore. It traveled at a speed of one hundred and sixty"
"x83","miles in the hour. But what was this speed compared with that which had"
"x83","carried the three heroes from the mouth of the Columbiad?"
"x83",""
"x83","Thus they sped from one town to the other, finding whole populations at"
"x83","table on their road, saluting them with the same acclamations,"
"x83","lavishing the same bravos! They traveled in this way through the east"
"x83","of the Union, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, Maine,"
"x83","and New Hampshire; the north and west by New York, Ohio, Michigan, and"
"x83","Wisconsin; returning to the south by Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas,"
"x83","Texas, and Louisiana; they went to the southeast by Alabama and"
"x83","Florida, going up by Georgia and the Carolinas, visiting the center by"
"x83","Tennessee, Kentucky, Virginia, and Indiana, and, after quitting the"
"x83","Washington station, re-entered Baltimore, where for four days one would"
"x83","have thought that the United States of America were seated at one"
"x83","immense banquet, saluting them simultaneously with the same hurrahs!"
"x83","The apotheosis was worthy of these three heroes whom fable would have"
"x83","placed in the rank of demigods."
"x83",""
"x83","And now will this attempt, unprecedented in the annals of travels, lead"
"x83","to any practical result? Will direct communication with the moon ever"
"x83","be established? Will they ever lay the foundation of a traveling"
"x83","service through the solar world? Will they go from one planet to"
"x83","another, from Jupiter to Mercury, and after awhile from one star to"
"x83","another, from the Polar to Sirius? Will this means of locomotion allow"
"x83","us to visit those suns which swarm in the firmament?"
"x83",""
"x83","To such questions no answer can be given. But knowing the bold"
"x83","ingenuity of the Anglo-Saxon race, no one would be astonished if the"
"x83","Americans seek to make some use of President Barbicane’s attempt."
"x83",""
"x83","Thus, some time after the return of the travelers, the public received"
"x83","with marked favor the announcement of a company, limited, with a"
"x83","capital of a hundred million of dollars, divided into a hundred"
"x83","thousand shares of a thousand dollars each, under the name of the"
"x83","“National Company of Interstellary Communication.” President,"
"x83","Barbicane; vice-president, Captain Nicholl; secretary, J. T. Maston;"
"x83","director of movements, Michel Ardan."
"x83",""
"x83","And as it is part of the American temperament to foresee everything in"
"x83","business, even failure, the Honorable Harry Trolloppe, judge"
"x83","commissioner, and Francis Drayton, magistrate, were nominated"
"x83","beforehand!"

"x83","******* Notes: Jules Verne’s “From the Earth to the Moon” and “A Trip"
"x83","Around It”"
"x83",""
"x83","I originally intended to “correct” some of the numbers in the book. For"
"x83","example, page 207 has “thirteenth” where “thirtieth” would be more"
"x83","appropriate. Some of the densities and volumes and masses don’t match"
"x83","up. The business with the wrong exhaust velocity of the gun is also a"
"x83","bit confusing. The dates and times aren’t quite consistent throughout,"
"x83","although they are close enough that Verne must have been working from a"
"x83","time-line. For example, I think he has the time for the fall back to"
"x83","earth exactly matching the time for the trip out. There are also"
"x83","inconsistent spellings, for example “aluminum” and “aluminium”. Some of"
"x83","these annoyed me, in the sense of disturbing my reading; since the"
"x83","reader is reading for pleasure, the annoyance should be removed."
"x83",""
"x83","All cases of the British? spelling of aluminium have been changed to"
"x83","the American spelling aluminum."
"x83",""
"x83","I decided that the correction project was going to be a lot of trouble,"
"x83","and might be a perversion of the original work. I concentrated instead"
"x83","on producing an accurate rendition of the text. However, if a French"
"x83","speaker can find a French edition, it might be nice to see if the"
"x83","translators introduced errors. The measurements seem to have been"
"x83","converted from metric without regard for significant figures."
"x83","Occasional conversions are simply omitted, with “feet” inserted for"
"x83","“meters” without fixing the numbers. These might be safely recomputed"
"x83","without doing violence to the spirit of the original work. Whether one"
"x83","should standardize the spelling of “aluminium” I don’t know."
"x83","“Aluminium” has a certain charm. I don’t know what American or English"
"x83","usage was at the time. We might consider converting all the"
"x83","temperatures to Fahrenheit. I suggest removing the page numbers,"
"x83","undoing all the hyphenation, and repackaging the lines at a length of"
"x83","(up to) 72 characters, with only occasional word breaks."
"x83",""
"x83","Page #s and a full reformating has been done. Line widow/orphans have"
"x83","been painstakingly removed. Hypenated words at the end of lines have"
"x83","been eliminated to the best of my judgement."
"x83",""
"x83","I think a table of units should be offered for the reader."
"x83","myriameter = 10 km"
"x83","fathom = 6 feet; league ~ 3 miles, but don’t know French usage in 1865."
"x83","page 125 has perigee 86,410 leagues (French), or 238,833 miles <mean>"
"x83","Would be nice to know the currency conversions of the day."
"x83",""
"x83","We may criticize Verne for his errors, but the remarkable thing is how"
"x83","much he got right! I think this was the first engineering proposal for"
"x83","space travel, using physics instead of magic. Verne deserves much of"
"x83","the credit for inspiring the early rocket pioneers, and ultimately"
"x83","today’s space program. As “literary” history, I note that Heinlein’s"
"x83","“The Man Who Sold the Moon” borrows from it."

"x83","is perihelium {sic} a real word? maybe substitute perihelion?"
"x83",""
"x83","I have changed the one case of perihelium to the correct perihelion."

"x83","There’s an incorrect reference to Nov. 30 in the early part of book 2"

"x103",""
"x103","Mr. Phileas Fogg lived, in 1872, at No. 7, Saville Row, Burlington"
"x103","Gardens, the house in which Sheridan died in 1814.  He was one of the"
"x103","most noticeable members of the Reform Club, though he seemed always to"
"x103","avoid attracting attention; an enigmatical personage, about whom little"
"x103","was known, except that he was a polished man of the world.  People said"
"x103","that he resembled Byron--at least that his head was Byronic; but he was"
"x103","a bearded, tranquil Byron, who might live on a thousand years without"
"x103","growing old."
"x103",""
"x103","Certainly an Englishman, it was more doubtful whether Phileas Fogg was"
"x103","a Londoner.  He was never seen on 'Change, nor at the Bank, nor in the"
"x103","counting-rooms of the ""City""; no ships ever came into London docks of"
"x103","which he was the owner; he had no public employment; he had never been"
"x103","entered at any of the Inns of Court, either at the Temple, or Lincoln's"
"x103","Inn, or Gray's Inn; nor had his voice ever resounded in the Court of"
"x103","Chancery, or in the Exchequer, or the Queen's Bench, or the"
"x103","Ecclesiastical Courts.  He certainly was not a manufacturer; nor was he"
"x103","a merchant or a gentleman farmer.  His name was strange to the"
"x103","scientific and learned societies, and he never was known to take part"
"x103","in the sage deliberations of the Royal Institution or the London"
"x103","Institution, the Artisan's Association, or the Institution of Arts and"
"x103","Sciences.  He belonged, in fact, to none of the numerous societies"
"x103","which swarm in the English capital, from the Harmonic to that of the"
"x103","Entomologists, founded mainly for the purpose of abolishing pernicious"
"x103","insects."
"x103",""
"x103","Phileas Fogg was a member of the Reform, and that was all."
"x103",""
"x103","The way in which he got admission to this exclusive club was simple"
"x103","enough."
"x103",""
"x103","He was recommended by the Barings, with whom he had an open credit."
"x103","His cheques were regularly paid at sight from his account current,"
"x103","which was always flush."
"x103",""
"x103","Was Phileas Fogg rich?  Undoubtedly.  But those who knew him best could"
"x103","not imagine how he had made his fortune, and Mr. Fogg was the last"
"x103","person to whom to apply for the information.  He was not lavish, nor,"
"x103","on the contrary, avaricious; for, whenever he knew that money was"
"x103","needed for a noble, useful, or benevolent purpose, he supplied it"
"x103","quietly and sometimes anonymously.  He was, in short, the least"
"x103","communicative of men.  He talked very little, and seemed all the more"
"x103","mysterious for his taciturn manner.  His daily habits were quite open"
"x103","to observation; but whatever he did was so exactly the same thing that"
"x103","he had always done before, that the wits of the curious were fairly"
"x103","puzzled."
"x103",""
"x103","Had he travelled?  It was likely, for no one seemed to know the world"
"x103","more familiarly; there was no spot so secluded that he did not appear"
"x103","to have an intimate acquaintance with it.  He often corrected, with a"
"x103","few clear words, the thousand conjectures advanced by members of the"
"x103","club as to lost and unheard-of travellers, pointing out the true"
"x103","probabilities, and seeming as if gifted with a sort of second sight, so"
"x103","often did events justify his predictions.  He must have travelled"
"x103","everywhere, at least in the spirit."
"x103",""
"x103","It was at least certain that Phileas Fogg had not absented himself from"
"x103","London for many years.  Those who were honoured by a better"
"x103","acquaintance with him than the rest, declared that nobody could pretend"
"x103","to have ever seen him anywhere else.  His sole pastimes were reading"
"x103","the papers and playing whist.  He often won at this game, which, as a"
"x103","silent one, harmonised with his nature; but his winnings never went"
"x103","into his purse, being reserved as a fund for his charities.  Mr. Fogg"
"x103","played, not to win, but for the sake of playing.  The game was in his"
"x103","eyes a contest, a struggle with a difficulty, yet a motionless,"
"x103","unwearying struggle, congenial to his tastes."
"x103",""
"x103","Phileas Fogg was not known to have either wife or children, which may"
"x103","happen to the most honest people; either relatives or near friends,"
"x103","which is certainly more unusual.  He lived alone in his house in"
"x103","Saville Row, whither none penetrated.  A single domestic sufficed to"
"x103","serve him.  He breakfasted and dined at the club, at hours"
"x103","mathematically fixed, in the same room, at the same table, never taking"
"x103","his meals with other members, much less bringing a guest with him; and"
"x103","went home at exactly midnight, only to retire at once to bed.  He never"
"x103","used the cosy chambers which the Reform provides for its favoured"
"x103","members.  He passed ten hours out of the twenty-four in Saville Row,"
"x103","either in sleeping or making his toilet.  When he chose to take a walk"
"x103","it was with a regular step in the entrance hall with its mosaic"
"x103","flooring, or in the circular gallery with its dome supported by twenty"
"x103","red porphyry Ionic columns, and illumined by blue painted windows."
"x103","When he breakfasted or dined all the resources of the club--its"
"x103","kitchens and pantries, its buttery and dairy--aided to crowd his table"
"x103","with their most succulent stores; he was served by the gravest waiters,"
"x103","in dress coats, and shoes with swan-skin soles, who proffered the"
"x103","viands in special porcelain, and on the finest linen; club decanters,"
"x103","of a lost mould, contained his sherry, his port, and his"
"x103","cinnamon-spiced claret; while his beverages were refreshingly cooled"
"x103","with ice, brought at great cost from the American lakes."
"x103",""
"x103","If to live in this style is to be eccentric, it must be confessed that"
"x103","there is something good in eccentricity."
"x103",""
"x103","The mansion in Saville Row, though not sumptuous, was exceedingly"
"x103","comfortable.  The habits of its occupant were such as to demand but"
"x103","little from the sole domestic, but Phileas Fogg required him to be"
"x103","almost superhumanly prompt and regular.  On this very 2nd of October he"
"x103","had dismissed James Forster, because that luckless youth had brought"
"x103","him shaving-water at eighty-four degrees Fahrenheit instead of"
"x103","eighty-six; and he was awaiting his successor, who was due at the house"
"x103","between eleven and half-past."
"x103",""
"x103","Phileas Fogg was seated squarely in his armchair, his feet close"
"x103","together like those of a grenadier on parade, his hands resting on his"
"x103","knees, his body straight, his head erect; he was steadily watching a"
"x103","complicated clock which indicated the hours, the minutes, the seconds,"
"x103","the days, the months, and the years.  At exactly half-past eleven Mr."
"x103","Fogg would, according to his daily habit, quit Saville Row, and repair"

"x103","itinerant singer, a circus-rider, when I used to vault like Leotard,"
"x103","and dance on a rope like Blondin.  Then I got to be a professor of"
"x103","gymnastics, so as to make better use of my talents; and then I was a"
"x103","sergeant fireman at Paris, and assisted at many a big fire.  But I"
"x103","quitted France five years ago, and, wishing to taste the sweets of"
"x103","domestic life, took service as a valet here in England.  Finding myself"
"x103","out of place, and hearing that Monsieur Phileas Fogg was the most exact"
"x103","and settled gentleman in the United Kingdom, I have come to monsieur in"
"x103","the hope of living with him a tranquil life, and forgetting even the"
"x103","name of Passepartout."""
"x103",""
"x103","""Passepartout suits me,"" responded Mr. Fogg.  ""You are well recommended"

"x103","Phileas Fogg got up, took his hat in his left hand, put it on his head"
"x103","with an automatic motion, and went off without a word."
"x103",""
"x103","Passepartout heard the street door shut once; it was his new master"

"x103","hair and whiskers were light, his forehead compact and unwrinkled, his"
"x103","face rather pale, his teeth magnificent.  His countenance possessed in"

"x103","Phileas Fogg was, indeed, exactitude personified, and this was betrayed"
"x103","even in the expression of his very hands and feet; for in men, as well"
"x103","as in animals, the limbs themselves are expressive of the passions."
"x103",""
"x103","He was so exact that he was never in a hurry, was always ready, and was"
"x103","economical alike of his steps and his motions.  He never took one step"
"x103","too many, and always went to his destination by the shortest cut; he"
"x103","made no superfluous gestures, and was never seen to be moved or"
"x103","agitated.  He was the most deliberate person in the world, yet always"
"x103","reached his destination at the exact moment."
"x103",""
"x103","He lived alone, and, so to speak, outside of every social relation; and"
"x103","as he knew that in this world account must be taken of friction, and"
"x103","that friction retards, he never rubbed against anybody."
"x103",""
"x103","As for Passepartout, he was a true Parisian of Paris.  Since he had"
"x103","abandoned his own country for England, taking service as a valet, he"
"x103","had in vain searched for a master after his own heart.  Passepartout"
"x103","was by no means one of those pert dunces depicted by Moliere with a"
"x103","bold gaze and a nose held high in the air; he was an honest fellow,"
"x103","with a pleasant face, lips a trifle protruding, soft-mannered and"
"x103","serviceable, with a good round head, such as one likes to see on the"
"x103","shoulders of a friend.  His eyes were blue, his complexion rubicund,"
"x103","his figure almost portly and well-built, his body muscular, and his"
"x103","physical powers fully developed by the exercises of his younger days."
"x103","His brown hair was somewhat tumbled; for, while the ancient sculptors"
"x103","are said to have known eighteen methods of arranging Minerva's tresses,"
"x103","Passepartout was familiar with but one of dressing his own: three"
"x103","strokes of a large-tooth comb completed his toilet."
"x103",""
"x103","It would be rash to predict how Passepartout's lively nature would"
"x103","agree with Mr. Fogg.  It was impossible to tell whether the new servant"
"x103","would turn out as absolutely methodical as his master required;"
"x103","experience alone could solve the question.  Passepartout had been a"
"x103","sort of vagrant in his early years, and now yearned for repose; but so"
"x103","far he had failed to find it, though he had already served in ten"
"x103","English houses.  But he could not take root in any of these; with"
"x103","chagrin, he found his masters invariably whimsical and irregular,"
"x103","constantly running about the country, or on the look-out for adventure."
"x103","His last master, young Lord Longferry, Member of Parliament, after"
"x103","passing his nights in the Haymarket taverns, was too often brought home"
"x103","in the morning on policemen's shoulders.  Passepartout, desirous of"
"x103","respecting the gentleman whom he served, ventured a mild remonstrance"
"x103","on such conduct; which, being ill-received, he took his leave.  Hearing"
"x103","that Mr. Phileas Fogg was looking for a servant, and that his life was"
"x103","one of unbroken regularity, that he neither travelled nor stayed from"
"x103","home overnight, he felt sure that this would be the place he was after."
"x103","He presented himself, and was accepted, as has been seen."
"x103",""
"x103","At half-past eleven, then, Passepartout found himself alone in the"
"x103","house in Saville Row.  He began its inspection without delay, scouring"
"x103","it from cellar to garret.  So clean, well-arranged, solemn a mansion"
"x103","pleased him; it seemed to him like a snail's shell, lighted and warmed"
"x103","by gas, which sufficed for both these purposes.  When Passepartout"
"x103","reached the second story he recognised at once the room which he was to"
"x103","inhabit, and he was well satisfied with it.  Electric bells and"
"x103","speaking-tubes afforded communication with the lower stories; while on"
"x103","the mantel stood an electric clock, precisely like that in Mr. Fogg's"
"x103","bedchamber, both beating the same second at the same instant.  ""That's"
"x103","good, that'll do,"" said Passepartout to himself."
"x103",""
"x103","He suddenly observed, hung over the clock, a card which, upon"
"x103","inspection, proved to be a programme of the daily routine of the house."
"x103","It comprised all that was required of the servant, from eight in the"
"x103","morning, exactly at which hour Phileas Fogg rose, till half-past"
"x103","eleven, when he left the house for the Reform Club--all the details of"
"x103","service, the tea and toast at twenty-three minutes past eight, the"
"x103","shaving-water at thirty-seven minutes past nine, and the toilet at"
"x103","twenty minutes before ten.  Everything was regulated and foreseen that"
"x103","was to be done from half-past eleven a.m. till midnight, the hour at"
"x103","which the methodical gentleman retired."
"x103",""
"x103","Mr. Fogg's wardrobe was amply supplied and in the best taste.  Each"
"x103","pair of trousers, coat, and vest bore a number, indicating the time of"
"x103","year and season at which they were in turn to be laid out for wearing;"
"x103","and the same system was applied to the master's shoes.  In short, the"
"x103","house in Saville Row, which must have been a very temple of disorder"
"x103","and unrest under the illustrious but dissipated Sheridan, was cosiness,"
"x103","comfort, and method idealised.  There was no study, nor were there"
"x103","books, which would have been quite useless to Mr. Fogg; for at the"
"x103","Reform two libraries, one of general literature and the other of law"
"x103","and politics, were at his service.  A moderate-sized safe stood in his"
"x103","bedroom, constructed so as to defy fire as well as burglars; but"
"x103","Passepartout found neither arms nor hunting weapons anywhere;"
"x103","everything betrayed the most tranquil and peaceable habits."
"x103",""
"x103","Having scrutinised the house from top to bottom, he rubbed his hands, a"
"x103","broad smile overspread his features, and he said joyfully, ""This is"
"x103","just what I wanted!  Ah, we shall get on together, Mr. Fogg and I!"
"x103","What a domestic and regular gentleman!  A real machine; well, I don't"

"x103","It was Phileas Fogg, whose head now emerged from behind his newspapers,"
"x103","who made this remark.  He bowed to his friends, and entered into the"
"x103","conversation.  The affair which formed its subject, and which was town"
"x103","talk, had occurred three days before at the Bank of England.  A package"
"x103","of banknotes, to the value of fifty-five thousand pounds, had been"
"x103","taken from the principal cashier's table, that functionary being at the"
"x103","moment engaged in registering the receipt of three shillings and"
"x103","sixpence.  Of course, he could not have his eyes everywhere.  Let it be"
"x103","observed that the Bank of England reposes a touching confidence in the"
"x103","honesty of the public.  There are neither guards nor gratings to"
"x103","protect its treasures; gold, silver, banknotes are freely exposed, at"
"x103","the mercy of the first comer.  A keen observer of English customs"
"x103","relates that, being in one of the rooms of the Bank one day, he had the"
"x103","curiosity to examine a gold ingot weighing some seven or eight pounds."
"x103","He took it up, scrutinised it, passed it to his neighbour, he to the"
"x103","next man, and so on until the ingot, going from hand to hand, was"
"x103","transferred to the end of a dark entry; nor did it return to its place"
"x103","for half an hour.  Meanwhile, the cashier had not so much as raised his"
"x103","head.  But in the present instance things had not gone so smoothly."
"x103","The package of notes not being found when five o'clock sounded from the"
"x103","ponderous clock in the ""drawing office,"" the amount was passed to the"
"x103","account of profit and loss.  As soon as the robbery was discovered,"
"x103","picked detectives hastened off to Liverpool, Glasgow, Havre, Suez,"
"x103","Brindisi, New York, and other ports, inspired by the proffered reward"
"x103","of two thousand pounds, and five per cent. on the sum that might be"
"x103","recovered.  Detectives were also charged with narrowly watching those"
"x103","who arrived at or left London by rail, and a judicial examination was"
"x103","at once entered upon."
"x103",""
"x103","There were real grounds for supposing, as the Daily Telegraph said,"
"x103","that the thief did not belong to a professional band.  On the day of"
"x103","the robbery a well-dressed gentleman of polished manners, and with a"
"x103","well-to-do air, had been observed going to and fro in the paying room"
"x103","where the crime was committed.  A description of him was easily"
"x103","procured and sent to the detectives; and some hopeful spirits, of whom"
"x103","Ralph was one, did not despair of his apprehension.  The papers and"
"x103","clubs were full of the affair, and everywhere people were discussing"
"x103","the probabilities of a successful pursuit; and the Reform Club was"
"x103","especially agitated, several of its members being Bank officials."

"x103","Ralph would not concede that the work of the detectives was likely to"
"x103","be in vain, for he thought that the prize offered would greatly"
"x103","stimulate their zeal and activity.  But Stuart was far from sharing"
"x103","this confidence; and, as they placed themselves at the whist-table,"
"x103","they continued to argue the matter.  Stuart and Flanagan played"
"x103","together, while Phileas Fogg had Fallentin for his partner.  As the"
"x103","game proceeded the conversation ceased, excepting between the rubbers,"

"x103","ships daily passing to and fro on the great canal, by which the old"

"x103","detective, told his business at Bombay, and the position of affairs"
"x103","relative to the supposed robber, and nervously asked if a warrant had"
"x103","arrived from London.  It had not reached the office; indeed, there had"

"x103","tried to obtain an order of arrest from the director of the Bombay"
"x103","police.  This the director refused, as the matter concerned the London"

"x103","Passepartout, however, had no sooner heard his master's orders on"

"x103","gauze, looped up with gold and silver, danced airily, but with perfect"
"x103","modesty, to the sound of viols and the clanging of tambourines.  It is"
"x103","needless to say that Passepartout watched these curious ceremonies with"
"x103","staring eyes and gaping mouth, and that his countenance was that of the"
"x103","greenest booby imaginable."

"x103","towards the station, when he happened to espy the splendid pagoda on"

"x103","enter certain Indian temples, and that even the faithful must not go in"
"x103","without first leaving their shoes outside the door.  It may be said"
"x103","here that the wise policy of the British Government severely punishes a"

"x103","Passepartout, however, thinking no harm, went in like a simple tourist,"

"x103","At five minutes before eight, Passepartout, hatless, shoeless, and"

"x103","Fogg's whist partners on the Mongolia, now on his way to join his corps"
"x103","at Benares.  Sir Francis was a tall, fair man of fifty, who had greatly"

"x103","almost as familiar as a native with the customs, history, and character"
"x103","of India and its people.  But Phileas Fogg, who was not travelling, but"
"x103","only describing a circumference, took no pains to inquire into these"
"x103","subjects; he was a solid body, traversing an orbit around the"
"x103","terrestrial globe, according to the laws of rational mechanics.  He was"
"x103","at this moment calculating in his mind the number of hours spent since"
"x103","his departure from London, and, had it been in his nature to make a"

"x103","Sir Francis Cromarty had observed the oddity of his travelling"

"x103","Phileas Fogg had not concealed from Sir Francis his design of going"

"x103","an English engineer and fed with English coal, threw out its smoke upon"
"x103","cotton, coffee, nutmeg, clove, and pepper plantations, while the steam"
"x103","curled in spirals around groups of palm-trees, in the midst of which"
"x103","were seen picturesque bungalows, viharis (sort of abandoned"

"x103","graceful pagodas, and the famous Aurungabad, capital of the ferocious"
"x103","Aureng-Zeb, now the chief town of one of the detached provinces of the"
"x103","kingdom of the Nizam.  It was thereabouts that Feringhea, the Thuggee"
"x103","chief, king of the stranglers, held his sway.  These ruffians, united"
"x103","by a secret bond, strangled victims of every age in honour of the"
"x103","goddess Death, without ever shedding blood; there was a period when"
"x103","this part of the country could scarcely be travelled over without"
"x103","corpses being found in every direction.  The English Government has"

"x103","At half-past twelve the train stopped at Burhampoor where Passepartout"

"x103","Passepartout was now plunged into absorbing reverie.  Up to his arrival"
"x103","at Bombay, he had entertained hopes that their journey would end there;"
"x103","but, now that they were plainly whirling across India at full speed, a"
"x103","sudden change had come over the spirit of his dreams.  His old vagabond"
"x103","nature returned to him; the fantastic ideas of his youth once more took"
"x103","possession of him.  He came to regard his master's project as intended"
"x103","in good earnest, believed in the reality of the bet, and therefore in"
"x103","the tour of the world and the necessity of making it without fail"
"x103","within the designated period.  Already he began to worry about possible"
"x103","delays, and accidents which might happen on the way.  He recognised"
"x103","himself as being personally interested in the wager, and trembled at"
"x103","the thought that he might have been the means of losing it by his"
"x103","unpardonable folly of the night before.  Being much less cool-headed"
"x103","than Mr. Fogg, he was much more restless, counting and recounting the"
"x103","days passed over, uttering maledictions when the train stopped, and"
"x103","accusing it of sluggishness, and mentally blaming Mr. Fogg for not"
"x103","having bribed the engineer.  The worthy fellow was ignorant that, while"
"x103","it was possible by such means to hasten the rate of a steamer, it could"
"x103","not be done on the railway."

"x103","The train entered the defiles of the Sutpour Mountains, which separate"

"x103","consulting his watch, he replied that it was three in the morning."
"x103","This famous timepiece, always regulated on the Greenwich meridian,"
"x103","which was now some seventy-seven degrees westward, was at least four"
"x103","hours slow.  Sir Francis corrected Passepartout's time, whereupon the"

"x103","general insisting that the watch should be regulated in each new"
"x103","meridian, since he was constantly going eastward, that is in the face"
"x103","of the sun, and therefore the days were shorter by four minutes for"

"x103","this direction had not gone far, and the elephant still preserved his"
"x103","natural gentleness.  Kiouni--this was the name of the beast--could"
"x103","doubtless travel rapidly for a long time, and, in default of any other"
"x103","means of conveyance, Mr. Fogg resolved to hire him.  But elephants are"
"x103","far from cheap in India, where they are becoming scarce, the males,"
"x103","which alone are suitable for circus shows, are much sought, especially"
"x103","as but few of them are domesticated.  When therefore Mr. Fogg proposed"
"x103","to the Indian to hire Kiouni, he refused point-blank.  Mr. Fogg"
"x103","persisted, offering the excessive sum of ten pounds an hour for the"
"x103","loan of the beast to Allahabad.  Refused.  Twenty pounds?  Refused"
"x103","also.  Forty pounds?  Still refused.  Passepartout jumped at each"
"x103","advance; but the Indian declined to be tempted.  Yet the offer was an"
"x103","alluring one, for, supposing it took the elephant fifteen hours to"
"x103","reach Allahabad, his owner would receive no less than six hundred"
"x103","pounds sterling."
"x103",""
"x103","Phileas Fogg, without getting in the least flurried, then proposed to"
"x103","purchase the animal outright, and at first offered a thousand pounds"
"x103","for him.  The Indian, perhaps thinking he was going to make a great"
"x103","bargain, still refused."
"x103",""
"x103","Sir Francis Cromarty took Mr. Fogg aside, and begged him to reflect"
"x103","before he went any further; to which that gentleman replied that he was"
"x103","not in the habit of acting rashly, that a bet of twenty thousand pounds"
"x103","was at stake, that the elephant was absolutely necessary to him, and"
"x103","that he would secure him if he had to pay twenty times his value."
"x103","Returning to the Indian, whose small, sharp eyes, glistening with"
"x103","avarice, betrayed that with him it was only a question of how great a"
"x103","price he could obtain.  Mr. Fogg offered first twelve hundred, then"
"x103","fifteen hundred, eighteen hundred, two thousand pounds.  Passepartout,"
"x103","usually so rubicund, was fairly white with suspense."
"x103",""
"x103","At two thousand pounds the Indian yielded."
"x103",""
"x103","""What a price, good heavens!"" cried Passepartout, ""for an elephant."""
"x103",""
"x103","It only remained now to find a guide, which was comparatively easy.  A"
"x103","young Parsee, with an intelligent face, offered his services, which Mr."
"x103","Fogg accepted, promising so generous a reward as to materially"
"x103","stimulate his zeal.  The elephant was led out and equipped.  The"
"x103","Parsee, who was an accomplished elephant driver, covered his back with"
"x103","a sort of saddle-cloth, and attached to each of his flanks some"
"x103","curiously uncomfortable howdahs.  Phileas Fogg paid the Indian with"
"x103","some banknotes which he extracted from the famous carpet-bag, a"
"x103","proceeding that seemed to deprive poor Passepartout of his vitals."
"x103","Then he offered to carry Sir Francis to Allahabad, which the brigadier"
"x103","gratefully accepted, as one traveller the more would not be likely to"
"x103","fatigue the gigantic beast.  Provisions were purchased at Kholby, and,"
"x103","while Sir Francis and Mr. Fogg took the howdahs on either side,"
"x103","Passepartout got astride the saddle-cloth between them.  The Parsee"
"x103","perched himself on the elephant's neck, and at nine o'clock they set"
"x103","out from the village, the animal marching off through the dense forest"
"x103","of palms by the shortest cut."

"x103","FORESTS, AND WHAT ENSUED"
"x103",""
"x103",""
"x103","In order to shorten the journey, the guide passed to the left of the"
"x103","line where the railway was still in process of being built.  This line,"
"x103","owing to the capricious turnings of the Vindhia Mountains, did not"
"x103","pursue a straight course.  The Parsee, who was quite familiar with the"
"x103","roads and paths in the district, declared that they would gain twenty"
"x103","miles by striking directly through the forest."
"x103",""
"x103","Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty, plunged to the neck in the"
"x103","peculiar howdahs provided for them, were horribly jostled by the swift"
"x103","trotting of the elephant, spurred on as he was by the skilful Parsee;"
"x103","but they endured the discomfort with true British phlegm, talking"
"x103","little, and scarcely able to catch a glimpse of each other.  As for"
"x103","Passepartout, who was mounted on the beast's back, and received the"
"x103","direct force of each concussion as he trod along, he was very careful,"
"x103","in accordance with his master's advice, to keep his tongue from between"
"x103","his teeth, as it would otherwise have been bitten off short.  The"
"x103","worthy fellow bounced from the elephant's neck to his rump, and vaulted"
"x103","like a clown on a spring-board; yet he laughed in the midst of his"
"x103","bouncing, and from time to time took a piece of sugar out of his"
"x103","pocket, and inserted it in Kiouni's trunk, who received it without in"
"x103","the least slackening his regular trot."
"x103",""
"x103","After two hours the guide stopped the elephant, and gave him an hour"
"x103","for rest, during which Kiouni, after quenching his thirst at a"
"x103","neighbouring spring, set to devouring the branches and shrubs round"
"x103","about him.  Neither Sir Francis nor Mr. Fogg regretted the delay, and"
"x103","both descended with a feeling of relief.  ""Why, he's made of iron!"""
"x103","exclaimed the general, gazing admiringly on Kiouni."
"x103",""
"x103","""Of forged iron,"" replied Passepartout, as he set about preparing a"
"x103","hasty breakfast."
"x103",""
"x103","At noon the Parsee gave the signal of departure.  The country soon"
"x103","presented a very savage aspect.  Copses of dates and dwarf-palms"
"x103","succeeded the dense forests; then vast, dry plains, dotted with scanty"
"x103","shrubs, and sown with great blocks of syenite.  All this portion of"
"x103","Bundelcund, which is little frequented by travellers, is inhabited by a"
"x103","fanatical population, hardened in the most horrible practices of the"
"x103","Hindoo faith.  The English have not been able to secure complete"
"x103","dominion over this territory, which is subjected to the influence of"
"x103","rajahs, whom it is almost impossible to reach in their inaccessible"
"x103","mountain fastnesses. The travellers several times saw bands of"
"x103","ferocious Indians, who, when they perceived the elephant striding"
"x103","across-country, made angry and threatening motions.  The Parsee avoided"
"x103","them as much as possible.  Few animals were observed on the route; even"
"x103","the monkeys hurried from their path with contortions and grimaces which"
"x103","convulsed Passepartout with laughter."
"x103",""
"x103","In the midst of his gaiety, however, one thought troubled the worthy"
"x103","servant.  What would Mr. Fogg do with the elephant when he got to"
"x103","Allahabad?  Would he carry him on with him?  Impossible!  The cost of"
"x103","transporting him would make him ruinously expensive.  Would he sell"
"x103","him, or set him free?  The estimable beast certainly deserved some"
"x103","consideration.  Should Mr. Fogg choose to make him, Passepartout, a"
"x103","present of Kiouni, he would be very much embarrassed; and these"
"x103","thoughts did not cease worrying him for a long time."
"x103",""
"x103","The principal chain of the Vindhias was crossed by eight in the"
"x103","evening, and another halt was made on the northern slope, in a ruined"
"x103","bungalow.  They had gone nearly twenty-five miles that day, and an"
"x103","equal distance still separated them from the station of Allahabad."
"x103",""
"x103","The night was cold.  The Parsee lit a fire in the bungalow with a few"
"x103","dry branches, and the warmth was very grateful, provisions purchased at"
"x103","Kholby sufficed for supper, and the travellers ate ravenously.  The"
"x103","conversation, beginning with a few disconnected phrases, soon gave"
"x103","place to loud and steady snores.  The guide watched Kiouni, who slept"
"x103","standing, bolstering himself against the trunk of a large tree."
"x103","Nothing occurred during the night to disturb the slumberers, although"
"x103","occasional growls from panthers and chatterings of monkeys broke the"
"x103","silence; the more formidable beasts made no cries or hostile"
"x103","demonstration against the occupants of the bungalow.  Sir Francis slept"
"x103","heavily, like an honest soldier overcome with fatigue.  Passepartout"
"x103","was wrapped in uneasy dreams of the bouncing of the day before.  As for"
"x103","Mr. Fogg, he slumbered as peacefully as if he had been in his serene"
"x103","mansion in Saville Row."
"x103",""
"x103","The journey was resumed at six in the morning; the guide hoped to reach"
"x103","Allahabad by evening.  In that case, Mr. Fogg would only lose a part of"
"x103","the forty-eight hours saved since the beginning of the tour.  Kiouni,"
"x103","resuming his rapid gait, soon descended the lower spurs of the"
"x103","Vindhias, and towards noon they passed by the village of Kallenger, on"
"x103","the Cani, one of the branches of the Ganges.  The guide avoided"
"x103","inhabited places, thinking it safer to keep the open country, which"
"x103","lies along the first depressions of the basin of the great river."
"x103","Allahabad was now only twelve miles to the north-east.  They stopped"
"x103","under a clump of bananas, the fruit of which, as healthy as bread and"
"x103","as succulent as cream, was amply partaken of and appreciated."
"x103",""
"x103","At two o'clock the guide entered a thick forest which extended several"
"x103","miles; he preferred to travel under cover of the woods.  They had not"
"x103","as yet had any unpleasant encounters, and the journey seemed on the"
"x103","point of being successfully accomplished, when the elephant, becoming"
"x103","restless, suddenly stopped."
"x103",""
"x103","It was then four o'clock."
"x103",""
"x103","""What's the matter?"" asked Sir Francis, putting out his head."
"x103",""
"x103","""I don't know, officer,"" replied the Parsee, listening attentively to a"
"x103","confused murmur which came through the thick branches."
"x103",""
"x103","The murmur soon became more distinct; it now seemed like a distant"
"x103","concert of human voices accompanied by brass instruments.  Passepartout"
"x103","was all eyes and ears.  Mr. Fogg patiently waited without a word.  The"
"x103","Parsee jumped to the ground, fastened the elephant to a tree, and"
"x103","plunged into the thicket.  He soon returned, saying:"
"x103",""
"x103","""A procession of Brahmins is coming this way.  We must prevent their"
"x103","seeing us, if possible."""
"x103",""
"x103","The guide unloosed the elephant and led him into a thicket, at the same"
"x103","time asking the travellers not to stir.  He held himself ready to"
"x103","bestride the animal at a moment's notice, should flight become"
"x103","necessary; but he evidently thought that the procession of the faithful"
"x103","would pass without perceiving them amid the thick foliage, in which"
"x103","they were wholly concealed."
"x103",""
"x103","The discordant tones of the voices and instruments drew nearer, and now"
"x103","droning songs mingled with the sound of the tambourines and cymbals."
"x103","The head of the procession soon appeared beneath the trees, a hundred"
"x103","paces away; and the strange figures who performed the religious"
"x103","ceremony were easily distinguished through the branches.  First came"
"x103","the priests, with mitres on their heads, and clothed in long lace"
"x103","robes.  They were surrounded by men, women, and children, who sang a"
"x103","kind of lugubrious psalm, interrupted at regular intervals by the"
"x103","tambourines and cymbals; while behind them was drawn a car with large"
"x103","wheels, the spokes of which represented serpents entwined with each"
"x103","other.  Upon the car, which was drawn by four richly caparisoned zebus,"
"x103","stood a hideous statue with four arms, the body coloured a dull red,"
"x103","with haggard eyes, dishevelled hair, protruding tongue, and lips tinted"
"x103","with betel.  It stood upright upon the figure of a prostrate and"
"x103","headless giant."
"x103",""
"x103","Sir Francis, recognising the statue, whispered, ""The goddess Kali; the"
"x103","goddess of love and death."""

"x103","""Of death, perhaps,"" muttered back Passepartout, ""but of love--that"
"x103","ugly old hag?  Never!"""

"x103","The Parsee made a motion to keep silence."
"x103",""
"x103","A group of old fakirs were capering and making a wild ado round the"
"x103","statue; these were striped with ochre, and covered with cuts whence"
"x103","their blood issued drop by drop--stupid fanatics, who, in the great"
"x103","Indian ceremonies, still throw themselves under the wheels of"
"x103","Juggernaut.  Some Brahmins, clad in all the sumptuousness of Oriental"
"x103","apparel, and leading a woman who faltered at every step, followed."
"x103","This woman was young, and as fair as a European.  Her head and neck,"
"x103","shoulders, ears, arms, hands, and toes were loaded down with jewels and"
"x103","gems with bracelets, earrings, and rings; while a tunic bordered with"
"x103","gold, and covered with a light muslin robe, betrayed the outline of her"
"x103","form."
"x103",""
"x103","The guards who followed the young woman presented a violent contrast to"
"x103","her, armed as they were with naked sabres hung at their waists, and"
"x103","long damascened pistols, and bearing a corpse on a palanquin.  It was"
"x103","the body of an old man, gorgeously arrayed in the habiliments of a"
"x103","rajah, wearing, as in life, a turban embroidered with pearls, a robe of"
"x103","tissue of silk and gold, a scarf of cashmere sewed with diamonds, and"
"x103","the magnificent weapons of a Hindoo prince.  Next came the musicians"
"x103","and a rearguard of capering fakirs, whose cries sometimes drowned the"
"x103","noise of the instruments; these closed the procession."

"x103","Sir Francis watched the procession with a sad countenance, and, turning"
"x103","to the guide, said, ""A suttee."""

"x103","The Parsee nodded, and put his finger to his lips.  The procession"
"x103","slowly wound under the trees, and soon its last ranks disappeared in"

"x103",""
"x103","""These sacrifices do not occur in the larger portion of India,"" replied"
"x103","Sir Francis; ""but we have no power over these savage territories, and"

"x103","allowance of rice, treat her with contempt; she would be looked upon as"
"x103","an unclean creature, and would die in some corner, like a scurvy dog."
"x103","The prospect of so frightful an existence drives these poor creatures"
"x103","to the sacrifice much more than love or religious fanaticism."
"x103","Sometimes, however, the sacrifice is really voluntary, and it requires"
"x103","the active interference of the Government to prevent it.  Several years"
"x103","ago, when I was living at Bombay, a young widow asked permission of the"
"x103","governor to be burned along with her husband's body; but, as you may"

"x103","As soon as night fell, about six o'clock, they decided to make a"

"x103","After a last consultation, the guide announced that he was ready for"

"x103","roundabout way, so as to get at the pagoda on the rear.  They reached"
"x103","the walls about half-past twelve, without having met anyone; here there"
"x103","was no guard, nor were there either windows or doors."
"x103",""
"x103","The night was dark.  The moon, on the wane, scarcely left the horizon,"

"x103","It was not enough to reach the walls; an opening in them must be"
"x103","accomplished, and to attain this purpose the party only had their"
"x103","pocket-knives.  Happily the temple walls were built of brick and wood,"
"x103","which could be penetrated with little difficulty; after one brick had"
"x103","been taken out, the rest would yield easily."

"x103","They set noiselessly to work, and the Parsee on one side and"

"x103","aperture two feet wide.  They were getting on rapidly, when suddenly a"
"x103","cry was heard in the interior of the temple, followed almost instantly"
"x103","by other cries replying from the outside.  Passepartout and the guide"
"x103","stopped.  Had they been heard?  Was the alarm being given?  Common"
"x103","prudence urged them to retire, and they did so, followed by Phileas"
"x103","Fogg and Sir Francis.  They again hid themselves in the wood, and"
"x103","waited till the disturbance, whatever it might be, ceased, holding"
"x103","themselves ready to resume their attempt without delay.  But, awkwardly"
"x103","enough, the guards now appeared at the rear of the temple, and there"
"x103","installed themselves, in readiness to prevent a surprise."
"x103",""
"x103","It would be difficult to describe the disappointment of the party, thus"
"x103","interrupted in their work.  They could not now reach the victim; how,"
"x103","then, could they save her?  Sir Francis shook his fists, Passepartout"
"x103","was beside himself, and the guide gnashed his teeth with rage.  The"

"x103","This would be utter folly, and it was hard to admit that Fogg was such"

"x103","they were able to observe the sleeping groups."

"x103","Meanwhile Passepartout, who had perched himself on the lower branches"

"x103","swung open, and a bright light escaped from its interior, in the midst"
"x103","of which Mr. Fogg and Sir Francis espied the victim.  She seemed,"
"x103","having shaken off the stupor of intoxication, to be striving to escape"
"x103","from her executioner.  Sir Francis's heart throbbed; and, convulsively"
"x103","seizing Mr. Fogg's hand, found in it an open knife.  Just at this"
"x103","moment the crowd began to move.  The young woman had again fallen into"
"x103","a stupor caused by the fumes of hemp, and passed among the fakirs, who"
"x103","escorted her with their wild, religious cries."

"x103","Phileas Fogg and his companions, mingling in the rear ranks of the"
"x103","crowd, followed; and in two minutes they reached the banks of the"

"x103","rajah's corpse.  In the semi-obscurity they saw the victim, quite"
"x103","senseless, stretched out beside her husband's body. Then a torch was"

"x103","At this moment Sir Francis and the guide seized Phileas Fogg, who, in"
"x103","an instant of mad generosity, was about to rush upon the pyre.  But he"

"x103","The inanimate victim was borne along by the vigorous arms which"
"x103","supported her, and which she did not seem in the least to burden.  Mr."

"x103","Passepartout was, no doubt, scarcely less stupefied."

"x103","The resuscitated rajah approached Sir Francis and Mr. Fogg, and, in an"

"x103","watch that nothing should be wanting to Aouda's comfort.  He visited"
"x103","her regularly each day at certain hours, not so much to talk himself,"
"x103","as to sit and hear her talk.  He treated her with the strictest"

"x103","All the detective's hopes and wishes were now centred on Hong Kong; for"

"x103","robber would probably escape him for ever.  Hong Kong was the last"

"x103","very certain.  The servant, enlightened by his disclosure, and afraid"
"x103","of being himself implicated in the crime, would doubtless become an"
"x103","ally of the detective.  But this method was a dangerous one, only to be"
"x103","employed when everything else had failed.  A word from Passepartout to"
"x103","his master would ruin all.  The detective was therefore in a sore"
"x103","strait.  But suddenly a new idea struck him.  The presence of Aouda on"

"x103","into the interior purposely in quest of this charming damsel?  Fix was"
"x103","fairly puzzled.  He asked himself whether there had not been a wicked"
"x103","elopement; and this idea so impressed itself upon his mind that he"
"x103","determined to make use of the supposed intrigue.  Whether the young"

"x103","preserved--that Fix would also leave Hong Kong at the same time with"
"x103","them, and probably on the same steamer."
"x103",""
"x103","Passepartout might have cudgelled his brain for a century without"
"x103","hitting upon the real object which the detective had in view.  He never"
"x103","could have imagined that Phileas Fogg was being tracked as a robber"
"x103","around the globe.  But, as it is in human nature to attempt the"
"x103","solution of every mystery, Passepartout suddenly discovered an"
"x103","explanation of Fix's movements, which was in truth far from"
"x103","unreasonable.  Fix, he thought, could only be an agent of Mr. Fogg's"
"x103","friends at the Reform Club, sent to follow him up, and to ascertain"
"x103","that he really went round the world as had been agreed upon."
"x103",""
"x103","""It's clear!"" repeated the worthy servant to himself, proud of his"
"x103","shrewdness.  ""He's a spy sent to keep us in view!  That isn't quite the"

"x103","gentlemen of the Reform, this shall cost you dear!"""

"x103","Passepartout, enchanted with his discovery, resolved to say nothing to"
"x103","his master, lest he should be justly offended at this mistrust on the"
"x103","part of his adversaries.  But he determined to chaff Fix, when he had"
"x103","the chance, with mysterious allusions, which, however, need not betray"
"x103","his real suspicions."
"x103",""
"x103","During the afternoon of Wednesday, 30th October, the Rangoon entered"
"x103","the Strait of Malacca, which separates the peninsula of that name from"
"x103","Sumatra.  The mountainous and craggy islets intercepted the beauties of"
"x103","this noble island from the view of the travellers.  The Rangoon weighed"
"x103","anchor at Singapore the next day at four a.m., to receive coal, having"
"x103","gained half a day on the prescribed time of her arrival.  Phileas Fogg"
"x103","noted this gain in his journal, and then, accompanied by Aouda, who"
"x103","betrayed a desire for a walk on shore, disembarked."
"x103",""
"x103","Fix, who suspected Mr. Fogg's every movement, followed them cautiously,"
"x103","without being himself perceived; while Passepartout, laughing in his"
"x103","sleeve at Fix's manoeuvres, went about his usual errands."
"x103",""
"x103","The island of Singapore is not imposing in aspect, for there are no"
"x103","mountains; yet its appearance is not without attractions.  It is a park"
"x103","checkered by pleasant highways and avenues.  A handsome carriage, drawn"
"x103","by a sleek pair of New Holland horses, carried Phileas Fogg and Aouda"
"x103","into the midst of rows of palms with brilliant foliage, and of"
"x103","clove-trees, whereof the cloves form the heart of a half-open flower."
"x103","Pepper plants replaced the prickly hedges of European fields;"
"x103","sago-bushes, large ferns with gorgeous branches, varied the aspect of"
"x103","this tropical clime; while nutmeg-trees in full foliage filled the air"
"x103","with a penetrating perfume.  Agile and grinning bands of monkeys"
"x103","skipped about in the trees, nor were tigers wanting in the jungles."
"x103",""
"x103","After a drive of two hours through the country, Aouda and Mr. Fogg"
"x103","returned to the town, which is a vast collection of heavy-looking,"
"x103","irregular houses, surrounded by charming gardens rich in tropical"
"x103","fruits and plants; and at ten o'clock they re-embarked, closely"
"x103","followed by the detective, who had kept them constantly in sight."
"x103",""
"x103","Passepartout, who had been purchasing several dozen mangoes--a fruit"
"x103","as large as good-sized apples, of a dark-brown colour outside and a"
"x103","bright red within, and whose white pulp, melting in the mouth, affords"
"x103","gourmands a delicious sensation--was waiting for them on deck.  He was"
"x103","only too glad to offer some mangoes to Aouda, who thanked him very"
"x103","gracefully for them."

"x103","At eleven o'clock the Rangoon rode out of Singapore harbour, and in a"
"x103","few hours the high mountains of Malacca, with their forests, inhabited"
"x103","by the most beautifully-furred tigers in the world, were lost to view."
"x103","Singapore is distant some thirteen hundred miles from the island of"
"x103","Hong Kong, which is a little English colony near the Chinese coast."
"x103","Phileas Fogg hoped to accomplish the journey in six days, so as to be"
"x103","in time for the steamer which would leave on the 6th of November for"
"x103","Yokohama, the principal Japanese port."

"x103","The Rangoon had a large quota of passengers, many of whom disembarked"

"x103","The weather, which had hitherto been fine, changed with the last"
"x103","quarter of the moon.  The sea rolled heavily, and the wind at intervals"
"x103","rose almost to a storm, but happily blew from the south-west, and thus"
"x103","aided the steamer's progress.  The captain as often as possible put up"
"x103","his sails, and under the double action of steam and sail the vessel"
"x103","made rapid progress along the coasts of Anam and Cochin China.  Owing"

"x103","precautions became necessary in unfavourable weather; but the loss of"
"x103","time which resulted from this cause, while it nearly drove Passepartout"
"x103","out of his senses, did not seem to affect his master in the least."
"x103","Passepartout blamed the captain, the engineer, and the crew, and"
"x103","consigned all who were connected with the ship to the land where the"
"x103","pepper grows.  Perhaps the thought of the gas, which was remorselessly"
"x103","burning at his expense in Saville Row, had something to do with his hot"
"x103","impatience."

"x103","Fix looked intently at his companion, whose countenance was as serene"

"x103","Fix, fairly puzzled, descended to his cabin and gave himself up to his"

"x103","master?  What part was he playing in all this: was he an accomplice or"
"x103","not?  Was the game, then, up?  Fix spent several hours turning these"
"x103","things over in his mind, sometimes thinking that all was lost, then"
"x103","persuading himself that Fogg was ignorant of his presence, and then"
"x103","undecided what course it was best to take."
"x103",""
"x103","Nevertheless, he preserved his coolness of mind, and at last resolved"
"x103","to deal plainly with Passepartout.  If he did not find it practicable"
"x103","to arrest Fogg at Hong Kong, and if Fogg made preparations to leave"
"x103","that last foothold of English territory, he, Fix, would tell"
"x103","Passepartout all.  Either the servant was the accomplice of his master,"
"x103","and in this case the master knew of his operations, and he should fail;"
"x103","or else the servant knew nothing about the robbery, and then his"
"x103","interest would be to abandon the robber."
"x103",""
"x103","Such was the situation between Fix and Passepartout.  Meanwhile Phileas"
"x103","Fogg moved about above them in the most majestic and unconscious"
"x103","indifference.  He was passing methodically in his orbit around the"
"x103","world, regardless of the lesser stars which gravitated around him.  Yet"
"x103","there was near by what the astronomers would call a disturbing star,"
"x103","which might have produced an agitation in this gentleman's heart.  But"
"x103","no! the charms of Aouda failed to act, to Passepartout's great"
"x103","surprise; and the disturbances, if they existed, would have been more"
"x103","difficult to calculate than those of Uranus which led to the discovery"
"x103","of Neptune."
"x103",""
"x103","It was every day an increasing wonder to Passepartout, who read in"
"x103","Aouda's eyes the depths of her gratitude to his master.  Phileas Fogg,"
"x103","though brave and gallant, must be, he thought, quite heartless.  As to"
"x103","the sentiment which this journey might have awakened in him, there was"
"x103","clearly no trace of such a thing; while poor Passepartout existed in"
"x103","perpetual reveries."

"x103","One day he was leaning on the railing of the engine-room, and was"
"x103","observing the engine, when a sudden pitch of the steamer threw the"

"x103","this made Passepartout indignant."

"x103","""The valves are not sufficiently charged!"" he exclaimed.  ""We are not"

"x103","progress of the ship by lending a hand with the crew.  He overwhelmed"
"x103","the captain, officers, and sailors, who could not help laughing at his"

"x103","Fix now decided to make a bold move; he resolved to tell Passepartout"
"x103","all.  It seemed to be the only possible means of keeping Phileas Fogg"
"x103","several days longer at Hong Kong.  He accordingly invited his companion"
"x103","into a tavern which caught his eye on the quay.  On entering, they"
"x103","found themselves in a large room handsomely decorated, at the end of"
"x103","which was a large camp-bed furnished with cushions.  Several persons"
"x103","lay upon this bed in a deep sleep.  At the small tables which were"
"x103","arranged about the room some thirty customers were drinking English"
"x103","beer, porter, gin, and brandy; smoking, the while, long red clay pipes"
"x103","stuffed with little balls of opium mingled with essence of rose.  From"
"x103","time to time one of the smokers, overcome with the narcotic, would slip"
"x103","under the table, whereupon the waiters, taking him by the head and"
"x103","feet, carried and laid him upon the bed.  The bed already supported"
"x103","twenty of these stupefied sots."
"x103",""
"x103","Fix and Passepartout saw that they were in a smoking-house haunted by"
"x103","those wretched, cadaverous, idiotic creatures to whom the English"
"x103","merchants sell every year the miserable drug called opium, to the"
"x103","amount of one million four hundred thousand pounds--thousands devoted"
"x103","to one of the most despicable vices which afflict humanity!  The"
"x103","Chinese government has in vain attempted to deal with the evil by"
"x103","stringent laws.  It passed gradually from the rich, to whom it was at"
"x103","first exclusively reserved, to the lower classes, and then its ravages"
"x103","could not be arrested.  Opium is smoked everywhere, at all times, by"
"x103","men and women, in the Celestial Empire; and, once accustomed to it, the"
"x103","victims cannot dispense with it, except by suffering horrible bodily"
"x103","contortions and agonies.  A great smoker can smoke as many as eight"
"x103","pipes a day; but he dies in five years.  It was in one of these dens"
"x103","that Fix and Passepartout, in search of a friendly glass, found"
"x103","themselves.  Passepartout had no money, but willingly accepted Fix's"
"x103","invitation in the hope of returning the obligation at some future time."

"x103","escorting Aouda about the streets of the English quarter, making the"
"x103","necessary purchases for the long voyage before them.  It was all very"
"x103","well for an Englishman like Mr. Fogg to make the tour of the world with"

"x103","Mr. Fogg absorbed himself throughout the evening in the perusal of The"
"x103","Times and Illustrated London News."

"x103","Had he been capable of being astonished at anything, it would have been"
"x103","not to see his servant return at bedtime.  But, knowing that the"
"x103","steamer was not to leave for Yokohama until the next morning, he did"
"x103","not disturb himself about the matter.  When Passepartout did not appear"
"x103","the next morning to answer his master's bell, Mr. Fogg, not betraying"

"x103","Fogg then learned that the Carnatic had sailed the evening before.  He"

"x103","still lying under the stupefying influence of the opium."

"x103","John Bunsby, master, at length gave the order to start, and the"

"x103",""
"x103",""
"x103","This voyage of eight hundred miles was a perilous venture on a craft of"
"x103","twenty tons, and at that season of the year.  The Chinese seas are"
"x103","usually boisterous, subject to terrible gales of wind, and especially"
"x103","during the equinoxes; and it was now early November."
"x103",""
"x103","It would clearly have been to the master's advantage to carry his"
"x103","passengers to Yokohama, since he was paid a certain sum per day; but he"
"x103","would have been rash to attempt such a voyage, and it was imprudent"
"x103","even to attempt to reach Shanghai.  But John Bunsby believed in the"
"x103","Tankadere, which rode on the waves like a seagull; and perhaps he was"
"x103","not wrong."
"x103",""
"x103","Late in the day they passed through the capricious channels of Hong"
"x103","Kong, and the Tankadere, impelled by favourable winds, conducted"
"x103","herself admirably."
"x103",""
"x103","""I do not need, pilot,"" said Phileas Fogg, when they got into the open"
"x103","sea, ""to advise you to use all possible speed."""
"x103",""
"x103","""Trust me, your honour.  We are carrying all the sail the wind will let"
"x103","us.  The poles would add nothing, and are only used when we are going"
"x103","into port."""
"x103",""
"x103","""It's your trade, not mine, pilot, and I confide in you."""
"x103",""
"x103","Phileas Fogg, with body erect and legs wide apart, standing like a"
"x103","sailor, gazed without staggering at the swelling waters.  The young"
"x103","woman, who was seated aft, was profoundly affected as she looked out"
"x103","upon the ocean, darkening now with the twilight, on which she had"
"x103","ventured in so frail a vessel.  Above her head rustled the white sails,"
"x103","which seemed like great white wings.  The boat, carried forward by the"
"x103","wind, seemed to be flying in the air."
"x103",""
"x103","Night came.  The moon was entering her first quarter, and her"
"x103","insufficient light would soon die out in the mist on the horizon."
"x103","Clouds were rising from the east, and already overcast a part of the"
"x103","heavens."
"x103",""
"x103","The pilot had hung out his lights, which was very necessary in these"
"x103","seas crowded with vessels bound landward; for collisions are not"
"x103","uncommon occurrences, and, at the speed she was going, the least shock"
"x103","would shatter the gallant little craft."
"x103",""
"x103","Fix, seated in the bow, gave himself up to meditation.  He kept apart"
"x103","from his fellow-travellers, knowing Mr. Fogg's taciturn tastes;"
"x103","besides, he did not quite like to talk to the man whose favours he had"
"x103","accepted.  He was thinking, too, of the future.  It seemed certain that"
"x103","Fogg would not stop at Yokohama, but would at once take the boat for"
"x103","San Francisco; and the vast extent of America would ensure him impunity"
"x103","and safety.  Fogg's plan appeared to him the simplest in the world."
"x103","Instead of sailing directly from England to the United States, like a"
"x103","common villain, he had traversed three quarters of the globe, so as to"
"x103","gain the American continent more surely; and there, after throwing the"
"x103","police off his track, he would quietly enjoy himself with the fortune"
"x103","stolen from the bank.  But, once in the United States, what should he,"
"x103","Fix, do?  Should he abandon this man?  No, a hundred times no!  Until"
"x103","he had secured his extradition, he would not lose sight of him for an"
"x103","hour.  It was his duty, and he would fulfil it to the end.  At all"
"x103","events, there was one thing to be thankful for; Passepartout was not"
"x103","with his master; and it was above all important, after the confidences"
"x103","Fix had imparted to him, that the servant should never have speech with"
"x103","his master."
"x103",""
"x103","Phileas Fogg was also thinking of Passepartout, who had so strangely"
"x103","disappeared.  Looking at the matter from every point of view, it did"
"x103","not seem to him impossible that, by some mistake, the man might have"
"x103","embarked on the Carnatic at the last moment; and this was also Aouda's"
"x103","opinion, who regretted very much the loss of the worthy fellow to whom"
"x103","she owed so much.  They might then find him at Yokohama; for, if the"
"x103","Carnatic was carrying him thither, it would be easy to ascertain if he"
"x103","had been on board."
"x103",""
"x103","A brisk breeze arose about ten o'clock; but, though it might have been"
"x103","prudent to take in a reef, the pilot, after carefully examining the"
"x103","heavens, let the craft remain rigged as before.  The Tankadere bore"
"x103","sail admirably, as she drew a great deal of water, and everything was"
"x103","prepared for high speed in case of a gale."
"x103",""
"x103","Mr. Fogg and Aouda descended into the cabin at midnight, having been"
"x103","already preceded by Fix, who had lain down on one of the cots.  The"
"x103","pilot and crew remained on deck all night."
"x103",""
"x103","At sunrise the next day, which was 8th November, the boat had made more"
"x103","than one hundred miles.  The log indicated a mean speed of between"
"x103","eight and nine miles.  The Tankadere still carried all sail, and was"
"x103","accomplishing her greatest capacity of speed.  If the wind held as it"
"x103","was, the chances would be in her favour.  During the day she kept along"
"x103","the coast, where the currents were favourable; the coast, irregular in"
"x103","profile, and visible sometimes across the clearings, was at most five"
"x103","miles distant.  The sea was less boisterous, since the wind came off"
"x103","land--a fortunate circumstance for the boat, which would suffer, owing"
"x103","to its small tonnage, by a heavy surge on the sea."
"x103",""
"x103","The breeze subsided a little towards noon, and set in from the"
"x103","south-west.  The pilot put up his poles, but took them down again"
"x103","within two hours, as the wind freshened up anew."
"x103",""
"x103","Mr. Fogg and Aouda, happily unaffected by the roughness of the sea, ate"
"x103","with a good appetite, Fix being invited to share their repast, which he"
"x103","accepted with secret chagrin.  To travel at this man's expense and live"
"x103","upon his provisions was not palatable to him.  Still, he was obliged to"
"x103","eat, and so he ate."
"x103",""
"x103","When the meal was over, he took Mr. Fogg apart, and said, ""sir""--this"
"x103","""sir"" scorched his lips, and he had to control himself to avoid"
"x103","collaring this ""gentleman""--""sir, you have been very kind to give me a"
"x103","passage on this boat.  But, though my means will not admit of my"
"x103","expending them as freely as you, I must ask to pay my share--"""
"x103",""
"x103","""Let us not speak of that, sir,"" replied Mr. Fogg."
"x103",""
"x103","""But, if I insist--"""
"x103",""
"x103","""No, sir,"" repeated Mr. Fogg, in a tone which did not admit of a reply."
"x103","""This enters into my general expenses."""
"x103",""
"x103","Fix, as he bowed, had a stifled feeling, and, going forward, where he"
"x103","ensconced himself, did not open his mouth for the rest of the day."
"x103",""
"x103","Meanwhile they were progressing famously, and John Bunsby was in high"
"x103","hope.  He several times assured Mr. Fogg that they would reach Shanghai"
"x103","in time; to which that gentleman responded that he counted upon it."
"x103","The crew set to work in good earnest, inspired by the reward to be"
"x103","gained.  There was not a sheet which was not tightened, not a sail which"
"x103","was not vigorously hoisted; not a lurch could be charged to the man at"
"x103","the helm.  They worked as desperately as if they were contesting in a"
"x103","Royal yacht regatta."
"x103",""
"x103","By evening, the log showed that two hundred and twenty miles had been"
"x103","accomplished from Hong Kong, and Mr. Fogg might hope that he would be"
"x103","able to reach Yokohama without recording any delay in his journal; in"
"x103","which case, the many misadventures which had overtaken him since he"
"x103","left London would not seriously affect his journey."
"x103",""
"x103","The Tankadere entered the Straits of Fo-Kien, which separate the island"
"x103","of Formosa from the Chinese coast, in the small hours of the night, and"
"x103","crossed the Tropic of Cancer.  The sea was very rough in the straits,"
"x103","full of eddies formed by the counter-currents, and the chopping waves"
"x103","broke her course, whilst it became very difficult to stand on deck."
"x103",""
"x103","At daybreak the wind began to blow hard again, and the heavens seemed"
"x103","to predict a gale.  The barometer announced a speedy change, the"
"x103","mercury rising and falling capriciously; the sea also, in the"
"x103","south-east, raised long surges which indicated a tempest.  The sun had"
"x103","set the evening before in a red mist, in the midst of the"
"x103","phosphorescent scintillations of the ocean."
"x103",""
"x103","John Bunsby long examined the threatening aspect of the heavens,"
"x103","muttering indistinctly between his teeth.  At last he said in a low"
"x103","voice to Mr. Fogg, ""Shall I speak out to your honour?"""
"x103",""
"x103","""Of course."""
"x103",""
"x103","""Well, we are going to have a squall."""
"x103",""
"x103","""Is the wind north or south?"" asked Mr. Fogg quietly."
"x103",""
"x103","""South.  Look! a typhoon is coming up."""
"x103",""
"x103","""Glad it's a typhoon from the south, for it will carry us forward."""
"x103",""
"x103","""Oh, if you take it that way,"" said John Bunsby, ""I've nothing more to"
"x103","say."" John Bunsby's suspicions were confirmed.  At a less advanced"
"x103","season of the year the typhoon, according to a famous meteorologist,"
"x103","would have passed away like a luminous cascade of electric flame; but"
"x103","in the winter equinox it was to be feared that it would burst upon them"
"x103","with great violence."
"x103",""
"x103","The pilot took his precautions in advance.  He reefed all sail, the"
"x103","pole-masts were dispensed with; all hands went forward to the bows.  A"
"x103","single triangular sail, of strong canvas, was hoisted as a storm-jib,"
"x103","so as to hold the wind from behind.  Then they waited."
"x103",""
"x103","John Bunsby had requested his passengers to go below; but this"
"x103","imprisonment in so narrow a space, with little air, and the boat"
"x103","bouncing in the gale, was far from pleasant.  Neither Mr. Fogg, Fix,"
"x103","nor Aouda consented to leave the deck."
"x103",""
"x103","The storm of rain and wind descended upon them towards eight o'clock."
"x103","With but its bit of sail, the Tankadere was lifted like a feather by a"
"x103","wind, an idea of whose violence can scarcely be given.  To compare her"
"x103","speed to four times that of a locomotive going on full steam would be"
"x103","below the truth."
"x103",""
"x103","The boat scudded thus northward during the whole day, borne on by"
"x103","monstrous waves, preserving always, fortunately, a speed equal to"
"x103","theirs.  Twenty times she seemed almost to be submerged by these"
"x103","mountains of water which rose behind her; but the adroit management of"
"x103","the pilot saved her.  The passengers were often bathed in spray, but"
"x103","they submitted to it philosophically.  Fix cursed it, no doubt; but"
"x103","Aouda, with her eyes fastened upon her protector, whose coolness amazed"
"x103","her, showed herself worthy of him, and bravely weathered the storm.  As"
"x103","for Phileas Fogg, it seemed just as if the typhoon were a part of his"
"x103","programme."
"x103",""
"x103","Up to this time the Tankadere had always held her course to the north;"
"x103","but towards evening the wind, veering three quarters, bore down from"
"x103","the north-west.  The boat, now lying in the trough of the waves, shook"
"x103","and rolled terribly; the sea struck her with fearful violence.  At"
"x103","night the tempest increased in violence.  John Bunsby saw the approach"
"x103","of darkness and the rising of the storm with dark misgivings.  He"
"x103","thought awhile, and then asked his crew if it was not time to slacken"
"x103","speed.  After a consultation he approached Mr. Fogg, and said, ""I"
"x103","think, your honour, that we should do well to make for one of the ports"
"x103","on the coast."""
"x103",""
"x103","""I think so too."""
"x103",""
"x103","""Ah!"" said the pilot.  ""But which one?"""
"x103",""
"x103","""I know of but one,"" returned Mr. Fogg tranquilly."
"x103",""
"x103","""And that is--"""
"x103",""
"x103","""Shanghai."""
"x103",""
"x103","The pilot, at first, did not seem to comprehend; he could scarcely"
"x103","realise so much determination and tenacity.  Then he cried, ""Well--yes!"
"x103","Your honour is right.  To Shanghai!"""
"x103",""
"x103","So the Tankadere kept steadily on her northward track."
"x103",""
"x103","The night was really terrible; it would be a miracle if the craft did"
"x103","not founder.  Twice it could have been all over with her if the crew"
"x103","had not been constantly on the watch.  Aouda was exhausted, but did not"
"x103","utter a complaint.  More than once Mr. Fogg rushed to protect her from"
"x103","the violence of the waves."
"x103",""
"x103","Day reappeared.  The tempest still raged with undiminished fury; but"
"x103","the wind now returned to the south-east.  It was a favourable change,"
"x103","and the Tankadere again bounded forward on this mountainous sea, though"
"x103","the waves crossed each other, and imparted shocks and counter-shocks"
"x103","which would have crushed a craft less solidly built.  From time to time"
"x103","the coast was visible through the broken mist, but no vessel was in"
"x103","sight.  The Tankadere was alone upon the sea."
"x103",""
"x103","There were some signs of a calm at noon, and these became more distinct"
"x103","as the sun descended toward the horizon.  The tempest had been as brief"
"x103","as terrific.  The passengers, thoroughly exhausted, could now eat a"
"x103","little, and take some repose."
"x103",""
"x103","The night was comparatively quiet.  Some of the sails were again"
"x103","hoisted, and the speed of the boat was very good.  The next morning at"
"x103","dawn they espied the coast, and John Bunsby was able to assert that"
"x103","they were not one hundred miles from Shanghai.  A hundred miles, and"
"x103","only one day to traverse them!  That very evening Mr. Fogg was due at"
"x103","Shanghai, if he did not wish to miss the steamer to Yokohama.  Had"
"x103","there been no storm, during which several hours were lost, they would"
"x103","be at this moment within thirty miles of their destination."
"x103",""
"x103","The wind grew decidedly calmer, and happily the sea fell with it.  All"
"x103","sails were now hoisted, and at noon the Tankadere was within forty-five"
"x103","miles of Shanghai.  There remained yet six hours in which to accomplish"
"x103","that distance.  All on board feared that it could not be done, and"
"x103","every one--Phileas Fogg, no doubt, excepted--felt his heart beat with"
"x103","impatience.  The boat must keep up an average of nine miles an hour,"
"x103","and the wind was becoming calmer every moment!  It was a capricious"
"x103","breeze, coming from the coast, and after it passed the sea became"
"x103","smooth.  Still, the Tankadere was so light, and her fine sails caught"
"x103","the fickle zephyrs so well, that, with the aid of the currents John"
"x103","Bunsby found himself at six o'clock not more than ten miles from the"
"x103","mouth of Shanghai River.  Shanghai itself is situated at least twelve"
"x103","miles up the stream.  At seven they were still three miles from"
"x103","Shanghai.  The pilot swore an angry oath; the reward of two hundred"
"x103","pounds was evidently on the point of escaping him.  He looked at Mr."
"x103","Fogg.  Mr. Fogg was perfectly tranquil; and yet his whole fortune was"
"x103","at this moment at stake."
"x103",""
"x103","At this moment, also, a long black funnel, crowned with wreaths of"
"x103","smoke, appeared on the edge of the waters.  It was the American"
"x103","steamer, leaving for Yokohama at the appointed time."
"x103",""
"x103","""Confound her!"" cried John Bunsby, pushing back the rudder with a"
"x103","desperate jerk."
"x103",""
"x103","""Signal her!"" said Phileas Fogg quietly."
"x103",""
"x103","A small brass cannon stood on the forward deck of the Tankadere, for"
"x103","making signals in the fogs.  It was loaded to the muzzle; but just as"
"x103","the pilot was about to apply a red-hot coal to the touchhole, Mr. Fogg"
"x103","said, ""Hoist your flag!"""
"x103",""
"x103","The flag was run up at half-mast, and, this being the signal of"

"x103","The Carnatic, setting sail from Hong Kong at half-past six on the 7th"

"x103","It was Passepartout; and what had happened to him was as follows:"
"x103","Shortly after Fix left the opium den, two waiters had lifted the"

"x103","idea, the poor fellow awoke, and struggled against the stupefying"
"x103","influence of the narcotic.  The thought of a duty unfulfilled shook off"
"x103","his torpor, and he hurried from the abode of drunkenness.  Staggering"
"x103","and holding himself up by keeping against the walls, falling down and"
"x103","creeping up again, and irresistibly impelled by a kind of instinct, he"
"x103","kept crying out, ""The Carnatic! the Carnatic!"""

"x103","The steamer lay puffing alongside the quay, on the point of starting."
"x103","Passepartout had but few steps to go; and, rushing upon the plank, he"

"x103","moving off.  Several sailors, who were evidently accustomed to this"
"x103","sort of scene, carried the poor Frenchman down into the second cabin,"

"x103","miles away from China.  Thus he found himself the next morning on the"
"x103","deck of the Carnatic, and eagerly inhaling the exhilarating sea-breeze."
"x103","The pure air sobered him.  He began to collect his sense, which he"

"x103","but, though he was really on the Carnatic, his master was not there."
"x103",""
"x103","He fell thunderstruck on a seat.  He saw it all now.  He remembered"
"x103","that the time of sailing had been changed, that he should have informed"
"x103","his master of that fact, and that he had not done so.  It was his"
"x103","fault, then, that Mr. Fogg and Aouda had missed the steamer.  Yes, but"
"x103","it was still more the fault of the traitor who, in order to separate"
"x103","him from his master, and detain the latter at Hong Kong, had inveigled"
"x103","him into getting drunk!  He now saw the detective's trick; and at this"
"x103","moment Mr. Fogg was certainly ruined, his bet was lost, and he himself"
"x103","perhaps arrested and imprisoned!  At this thought Passepartout tore his"
"x103","hair.  Ah, if Fix ever came within his reach, what a settling of"
"x103","accounts there would be!"
"x103",""
"x103","After his first depression, Passepartout became calmer, and began to"
"x103","study his situation.  It was certainly not an enviable one.  He found"
"x103","himself on the way to Japan, and what should he do when he got there?"
"x103","His pocket was empty; he had not a solitary shilling, not so much as a"
"x103","penny.  His passage had fortunately been paid for in advance; and he"
"x103","had five or six days in which to decide upon his future course.  He"
"x103","fell to at meals with an appetite, and ate for Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and"
"x103","himself.  He helped himself as generously as if Japan were a desert,"
"x103","where nothing to eat was to be looked for."

"x103","At dawn on the 13th the Carnatic entered the port of Yokohama.  This is"
"x103","an important port of call in the Pacific, where all the mail-steamers,"
"x103","and those carrying travellers between North America, China, Japan, and"
"x103","the Oriental islands put in.  It is situated in the bay of Yeddo, and"
"x103","at but a short distance from that second capital of the Japanese"
"x103","Empire, and the residence of the Tycoon, the civil Emperor, before the"
"x103","Mikado, the spiritual Emperor, absorbed his office in his own.  The"
"x103","Carnatic anchored at the quay near the custom-house, in the midst of a"
"x103","crowd of ships bearing the flags of all nations."
"x103",""
"x103","Passepartout went timidly ashore on this so curious territory of the"
"x103","Sons of the Sun.  He had nothing better to do than, taking chance for"
"x103","his guide, to wander aimlessly through the streets of Yokohama.  He"
"x103","found himself at first in a thoroughly European quarter, the houses"
"x103","having low fronts, and being adorned with verandas, beneath which he"
"x103","caught glimpses of neat peristyles.  This quarter occupied, with its"
"x103","streets, squares, docks, and warehouses, all the space between the"
"x103","""promontory of the Treaty"" and the river.  Here, as at Hong Kong and"
"x103","Calcutta, were mixed crowds of all races, Americans and English,"
"x103","Chinamen and Dutchmen, mostly merchants ready to buy or sell anything."
"x103","The Frenchman felt himself as much alone among them as if he had"
"x103","dropped down in the midst of Hottentots."
"x103",""
"x103","He had, at least, one resource,--to call on the French and English"
"x103","consuls at Yokohama for assistance.  But he shrank from telling the"
"x103","story of his adventures, intimately connected as it was with that of"
"x103","his master; and, before doing so, he determined to exhaust all other"
"x103","means of aid.  As chance did not favour him in the European quarter, he"
"x103","penetrated that inhabited by the native Japanese, determined, if"
"x103","necessary, to push on to Yeddo."
"x103",""
"x103","The Japanese quarter of Yokohama is called Benten, after the goddess of"
"x103","the sea, who is worshipped on the islands round about.  There"
"x103","Passepartout beheld beautiful fir and cedar groves, sacred gates of a"
"x103","singular architecture, bridges half hid in the midst of bamboos and"
"x103","reeds, temples shaded by immense cedar-trees, holy retreats where were"
"x103","sheltered Buddhist priests and sectaries of Confucius, and interminable"
"x103","streets, where a perfect harvest of rose-tinted and red-cheeked"
"x103","children, who looked as if they had been cut out of Japanese screens,"
"x103","and who were playing in the midst of short-legged poodles and yellowish"
"x103","cats, might have been gathered."

"x103","The streets were crowded with people.  Priests were passing in"
"x103","processions, beating their dreary tambourines; police and custom-house"
"x103","officers with pointed hats encrusted with lac and carrying two sabres"
"x103","hung to their waists; soldiers, clad in blue cotton with white stripes,"
"x103","and bearing guns; the Mikado's guards, enveloped in silken doubles,"
"x103","hauberks and coats of mail; and numbers of military folk of all"
"x103","ranks--for the military profession is as much respected in Japan as it"
"x103","is despised in China--went hither and thither in groups and pairs."
"x103","Passepartout saw, too, begging friars, long-robed pilgrims, and simple"
"x103","civilians, with their warped and jet-black hair, big heads, long busts,"
"x103","slender legs, short stature, and complexions varying from copper-colour"
"x103","to a dead white, but never yellow, like the Chinese, from whom the"
"x103","Japanese widely differ.  He did not fail to observe the curious"
"x103","equipages--carriages and palanquins, barrows supplied with sails, and"
"x103","litters made of bamboo; nor the women--whom he thought not especially"
"x103","handsome--who took little steps with their little feet, whereon they"
"x103","wore canvas shoes, straw sandals, and clogs of worked wood, and who"
"x103","displayed tight-looking eyes, flat chests, teeth fashionably blackened,"
"x103","and gowns crossed with silken scarfs, tied in an enormous knot behind"
"x103","an ornament which the modern Parisian ladies seem to have borrowed from"
"x103","the dames of Japan."

"x103","Passepartout wandered for several hours in the midst of this motley"
"x103","crowd, looking in at the windows of the rich and curious shops, the"
"x103","jewellery establishments glittering with quaint Japanese ornaments, the"
"x103","restaurants decked with streamers and banners, the tea-houses, where"
"x103","the odorous beverage was being drunk with saki, a liquor concocted from"
"x103","the fermentation of rice, and the comfortable smoking-houses, where"
"x103","they were puffing, not opium, which is almost unknown in Japan, but a"
"x103","very fine, stringy tobacco.  He went on till he found himself in the"
"x103","fields, in the midst of vast rice plantations.  There he saw dazzling"
"x103","camellias expanding themselves, with flowers which were giving forth"
"x103","their last colours and perfumes, not on bushes, but on trees, and"
"x103","within bamboo enclosures, cherry, plum, and apple trees, which the"
"x103","Japanese cultivate rather for their blossoms than their fruit, and"
"x103","which queerly-fashioned, grinning scarecrows protected from the"
"x103","sparrows, pigeons, ravens, and other voracious birds.  On the branches"
"x103","of the cedars were perched large eagles; amid the foliage of the"
"x103","weeping willows were herons, solemnly standing on one leg; and on every"
"x103","hand were crows, ducks, hawks, wild birds, and a multitude of cranes,"
"x103","which the Japanese consider sacred, and which to their minds symbolise"
"x103","long life and prosperity."
"x103",""
"x103","As he was strolling along, Passepartout espied some violets among the"
"x103","shrubs."

"x103","""Good!"" said he; ""I'll have some supper."""
"x103",""
"x103","But, on smelling them, he found that they were odourless."

"x103","""No chance there,"" thought he."
"x103",""
"x103","The worthy fellow had certainly taken good care to eat as hearty a"
"x103","breakfast as possible before leaving the Carnatic; but, as he had been"
"x103","walking about all day, the demands of hunger were becoming importunate."
"x103","He observed that the butchers stalls contained neither mutton, goat,"
"x103","nor pork; and, knowing also that it is a sacrilege to kill cattle,"
"x103","which are preserved solely for farming, he made up his mind that meat"
"x103","was far from plentiful in Yokohama--nor was he mistaken; and, in"
"x103","default of butcher's meat, he could have wished for a quarter of wild"
"x103","boar or deer, a partridge, or some quails, some game or fish, which,"
"x103","with rice, the Japanese eat almost exclusively.  But he found it"
"x103","necessary to keep up a stout heart, and to postpone the meal he craved"
"x103","till the following morning.  Night came, and Passepartout re-entered"
"x103","the native quarter, where he wandered through the streets, lit by"
"x103","vari-coloured lanterns, looking on at the dancers, who were executing"
"x103","skilful steps and boundings, and the astrologers who stood in the open"
"x103","air with their telescopes.  Then he came to the harbour, which was lit"
"x103","up by the resin torches of the fishermen, who were fishing from their"
"x103","boats."
"x103",""
"x103","The streets at last became quiet, and the patrol, the officers of"
"x103","which, in their splendid costumes, and surrounded by their suites,"
"x103","Passepartout thought seemed like ambassadors, succeeded the bustling"

"x103","The next morning poor, jaded, famished Passepartout said to himself"
"x103","that he must get something to eat at all hazards, and the sooner he did"
"x103","so the better.  He might, indeed, sell his watch; but he would have"
"x103","starved first.  Now or never he must use the strong, if not melodious"
"x103","voice which nature had bestowed upon him.  He knew several French and"
"x103","English songs, and resolved to try them upon the Japanese, who must be"
"x103","lovers of music, since they were for ever pounding on their cymbals,"
"x103","tam-tams, and tambourines, and could not but appreciate European talent."
"x103",""
"x103","It was, perhaps, rather early in the morning to get up a concert, and"
"x103","the audience prematurely aroused from their slumbers, might not"
"x103","possibly pay their entertainer with coin bearing the Mikado's features."
"x103","Passepartout therefore decided to wait several hours; and, as he was"
"x103","sauntering along, it occurred to him that he would seem rather too well"
"x103","dressed for a wandering artist.  The idea struck him to change his"
"x103","garments for clothes more in harmony with his project; by which he"
"x103","might also get a little money to satisfy the immediate cravings of"

"x103",""
"x103","It was only after a long search that Passepartout discovered a native"
"x103","dealer in old clothes, to whom he applied for an exchange.  The man"
"x103","liked the European costume, and ere long Passepartout issued from his"
"x103","shop accoutred in an old Japanese coat, and a sort of one-sided turban,"
"x103","faded with long use.  A few small pieces of silver, moreover, jingled"

"x103","retain the most delightful of memories, as quickly as possible."""
"x103",""
"x103","It occurred to him to visit the steamers which were about to leave for"
"x103","America.  He would offer himself as a cook or servant, in payment of"
"x103","his passage and meals.  Once at San Francisco, he would find some means"
"x103","of going on.  The difficulty was, how to traverse the four thousand"
"x103","seven hundred miles of the Pacific which lay between Japan and the New"
"x103","World."
"x103",""
"x103","Passepartout was not the man to let an idea go begging, and directed"
"x103","his steps towards the docks.  But, as he approached them, his project,"
"x103","which at first had seemed so simple, began to grow more and more"
"x103","formidable to his mind.  What need would they have of a cook or servant"
"x103","on an American steamer, and what confidence would they put in him,"
"x103","dressed as he was?  What references could he give?"
"x103",""
"x103","As he was reflecting in this wise, his eyes fell upon an immense"

"x103","a company of jugglers."

"x103","the aid of his sturdy shoulders in the great exhibition of the ""human"

"x103","Before three o'clock the large shed was invaded by the spectators,"
"x103","comprising Europeans and natives, Chinese and Japanese, men, women and"

"x103","the boxes opposite the stage.  The musicians took up a position inside,"

"x103","tambourines, and immense drums."

"x103","The performance was much like all acrobatic displays; but it must be"
"x103","confessed that the Japanese are the first equilibrists in the world."

"x103","One, with a fan and some bits of paper, performed the graceful trick of"
"x103","the butterflies and the flowers; another traced in the air, with the"
"x103","odorous smoke of his pipe, a series of blue words, which composed a"
"x103","compliment to the audience; while a third juggled with some lighted"
"x103","candles, which he extinguished successively as they passed his lips,"
"x103","and relit again without interrupting for an instant his juggling."
"x103","Another reproduced the most singular combinations with a spinning-top;"
"x103","in his hands the revolving tops seemed to be animated with a life of"
"x103","their own in their interminable whirling; they ran over pipe-stems, the"
"x103","edges of sabres, wires and even hairs stretched across the stage; they"
"x103","turned around on the edges of large glasses, crossed bamboo ladders,"
"x103","dispersed into all the corners, and produced strange musical effects by"
"x103","the combination of their various pitches of tone.  The jugglers tossed"
"x103","them in the air, threw them like shuttlecocks with wooden battledores,"
"x103","and yet they kept on spinning; they put them into their pockets, and"
"x103","took them out still whirling as before."

"x103","It is useless to describe the astonishing performances of the acrobats"
"x103","and gymnasts.  The turning on ladders, poles, balls, barrels, &c., was"
"x103","executed with wonderful precision."
"x103",""
"x103","But the principal attraction was the exhibition of the Long Noses, a"
"x103","show to which Europe is as yet a stranger."
"x103",""
"x103","The Long Noses form a peculiar company, under the direct patronage of"
"x103","the god Tingou.  Attired after the fashion of the Middle Ages, they"
"x103","bore upon their shoulders a splendid pair of wings; but what especially"
"x103","distinguished them was the long noses which were fastened to their"
"x103","faces, and the uses which they made of them.  These noses were made of"
"x103","bamboo, and were five, six, and even ten feet long, some straight,"
"x103","others curved, some ribboned, and some having imitation warts upon"
"x103","them.  It was upon these appendages, fixed tightly on their real noses,"
"x103","that they performed their gymnastic exercises.  A dozen of these"
"x103","sectaries of Tingou lay flat upon their backs, while others, dressed to"
"x103","represent lightning-rods, came and frolicked on their noses, jumping"
"x103","from one to another, and performing the most skilful leapings and"
"x103","somersaults."
"x103",""
"x103","As a last scene, a ""human pyramid"" had been announced, in which fifty"
"x103","Long Noses were to represent the Car of Juggernaut.  But, instead of"
"x103","forming a pyramid by mounting each other's shoulders, the artists were"
"x103","to group themselves on top of the noses.  It happened that the"
"x103","performer who had hitherto formed the base of the Car had quitted the"
"x103","troupe, and as, to fill this part, only strength and adroitness were"
"x103","necessary, Passepartout had been chosen to take his place."
"x103",""
"x103","The poor fellow really felt sad when--melancholy reminiscence of his"
"x103","youth!--he donned his costume, adorned with vari-coloured wings, and"
"x103","fastened to his natural feature a false nose six feet long.  But he"
"x103","cheered up when he thought that this nose was winning him something to"
"x103","eat."
"x103",""
"x103","He went upon the stage, and took his place beside the rest who were to"
"x103","compose the base of the Car of Juggernaut.  They all stretched"
"x103","themselves on the floor, their noses pointing to the ceiling.  A second"
"x103","group of artists disposed themselves on these long appendages, then a"
"x103","third above these, then a fourth, until a human monument reaching to"
"x103","the very cornices of the theatre soon arose on top of the noses.  This"
"x103","elicited loud applause, in the midst of which the orchestra was just"
"x103","striking up a deafening air, when the pyramid tottered, the balance was"
"x103","lost, one of the lower noses vanished from the pyramid, and the human"
"x103","monument was shattered like a castle built of cards!"
"x103",""
"x103","It was Passepartout's fault.  Abandoning his position, clearing the"
"x103","footlights without the aid of his wings, and, clambering up to the"

"x103",""
"x103","They reached their destination on the morning of the 14th of November."
"x103","Phileas Fogg lost no time in going on board the Carnatic, where he"
"x103","learned, to Aouda's great delight--and perhaps to his own, though he"
"x103","betrayed no emotion--that Passepartout, a Frenchman, had really arrived"
"x103","on her the day before."
"x103",""
"x103","The San Francisco steamer was announced to leave that very evening, and"
"x103","it became necessary to find Passepartout, if possible, without delay."
"x103","Mr. Fogg applied in vain to the French and English consuls, and, after"
"x103","wandering through the streets a long time, began to despair of finding"
"x103","his missing servant.  Chance, or perhaps a kind of presentiment, at"
"x103","last led him into the Honourable Mr. Batulcar's theatre.  He certainly"
"x103","would not have recognised Passepartout in the eccentric mountebank's"
"x103","costume; but the latter, lying on his back, perceived his master in the"
"x103","gallery.  He could not help starting, which so changed the position of"
"x103","his nose as to bring the ""pyramid"" pell-mell upon the stage."
"x103",""
"x103","All this Passepartout learned from Aouda, who recounted to him what had"
"x103","taken place on the voyage from Hong Kong to Shanghai on the Tankadere,"
"x103","in company with one Mr. Fix."
"x103",""
"x103","Passepartout did not change countenance on hearing this name.  He"
"x103","thought that the time had not yet arrived to divulge to his master what"
"x103","had taken place between the detective and himself; and, in the account"
"x103","he gave of his absence, he simply excused himself for having been"
"x103","overtaken by drunkenness, in smoking opium at a tavern in Hong Kong."
"x103",""
"x103","Mr. Fogg heard this narrative coldly, without a word; and then"
"x103","furnished his man with funds necessary to obtain clothing more in"
"x103","harmony with his position.  Within an hour the Frenchman had cut off"
"x103","his nose and parted with his wings, and retained nothing about him"
"x103","which recalled the sectary of the god Tingou."
"x103",""
"x103","The steamer which was about to depart from Yokohama to San Francisco"
"x103","belonged to the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, and was named the"
"x103","General Grant.  She was a large paddle-wheel steamer of two thousand"
"x103","five hundred tons; well equipped and very fast.  The massive"
"x103","walking-beam rose and fell above the deck; at one end a piston-rod"
"x103","worked up and down; and at the other was a connecting-rod which, in"
"x103","changing the rectilinear motion to a circular one, was directly"
"x103","connected with the shaft of the paddles.  The General Grant was rigged"
"x103","with three masts, giving a large capacity for sails, and thus"
"x103","materially aiding the steam power.  By making twelve miles an hour, she"
"x103","would cross the ocean in twenty-one days.  Phileas Fogg was therefore"
"x103","justified in hoping that he would reach San Francisco by the 2nd of"
"x103","December, New York by the 11th, and London on the 20th--thus gaining"
"x103","several hours on the fatal date of the 21st of December."
"x103",""
"x103","There was a full complement of passengers on board, among them English,"
"x103","many Americans, a large number of coolies on their way to California,"
"x103","and several East Indian officers, who were spending their vacation in"
"x103","making the tour of the world.  Nothing of moment happened on the"
"x103","voyage; the steamer, sustained on its large paddles, rolled but little,"
"x103","and the Pacific almost justified its name.  Mr. Fogg was as calm and"
"x103","taciturn as ever.  His young companion felt herself more and more"
"x103","attached to him by other ties than gratitude; his silent but generous"
"x103","nature impressed her more than she thought; and it was almost"
"x103","unconsciously that she yielded to emotions which did not seem to have"
"x103","the least effect upon her protector.  Aouda took the keenest interest"
"x103","in his plans, and became impatient at any incident which seemed likely"
"x103","to retard his journey."
"x103",""
"x103","She often chatted with Passepartout, who did not fail to perceive the"
"x103","state of the lady's heart; and, being the most faithful of domestics,"
"x103","he never exhausted his eulogies of Phileas Fogg's honesty, generosity,"
"x103","and devotion.  He took pains to calm Aouda's doubts of a successful"
"x103","termination of the journey, telling her that the most difficult part of"
"x103","it had passed, that now they were beyond the fantastic countries of"
"x103","Japan and China, and were fairly on their way to civilised places"
"x103","again.  A railway train from San Francisco to New York, and a"
"x103","transatlantic steamer from New York to Liverpool, would doubtless bring"
"x103","them to the end of this impossible journey round the world within the"
"x103","period agreed upon."
"x103",""
"x103","On the ninth day after leaving Yokohama, Phileas Fogg had traversed"
"x103","exactly one half of the terrestrial globe.  The General Grant passed,"
"x103","on the 23rd of November, the one hundred and eightieth meridian, and"
"x103","was at the very antipodes of London.  Mr. Fogg had, it is true,"
"x103","exhausted fifty-two of the eighty days in which he was to complete the"
"x103","tour, and there were only twenty-eight left.  But, though he was only"
"x103","half-way by the difference of meridians, he had really gone over"
"x103","two-thirds of the whole journey; for he had been obliged to make long"
"x103","circuits from London to Aden, from Aden to Bombay, from Calcutta to"
"x103","Singapore, and from Singapore to Yokohama.  Could he have followed"
"x103","without deviation the fiftieth parallel, which is that of London, the"
"x103","whole distance would only have been about twelve thousand miles;"
"x103","whereas he would be forced, by the irregular methods of locomotion, to"
"x103","traverse twenty-six thousand, of which he had, on the 23rd of November,"
"x103","accomplished seventeen thousand five hundred.  And now the course was a"
"x103","straight one, and Fix was no longer there to put obstacles in their way!"
"x103",""
"x103","It happened also, on the 23rd of November, that Passepartout made a"
"x103","joyful discovery.  It will be remembered that the obstinate fellow had"
"x103","insisted on keeping his famous family watch at London time, and on"
"x103","regarding that of the countries he had passed through as quite false"
"x103","and unreliable.  Now, on this day, though he had not changed the hands,"
"x103","he found that his watch exactly agreed with the ship's chronometers."
"x103","His triumph was hilarious.  He would have liked to know what Fix would"
"x103","say if he were aboard!"
"x103",""
"x103","""The rogue told me a lot of stories,"" repeated Passepartout, ""about the"
"x103","meridians, the sun, and the moon!  Moon, indeed!  moonshine more"
"x103","likely!  If one listened to that sort of people, a pretty sort of time"
"x103","one would keep!  I was sure that the sun would some day regulate itself"
"x103","by my watch!"""
"x103",""
"x103","Passepartout was ignorant that, if the face of his watch had been"
"x103","divided into twenty-four hours, like the Italian clocks, he would have"
"x103","no reason for exultation; for the hands of his watch would then,"
"x103","instead of as now indicating nine o'clock in the morning, indicate nine"
"x103","o'clock in the evening, that is, the twenty-first hour after midnight"
"x103","precisely the difference between London time and that of the one"
"x103","hundred and eightieth meridian.  But if Fix had been able to explain"
"x103","this purely physical effect, Passepartout would not have admitted, even"
"x103","if he had comprehended it.  Moreover, if the detective had been on"
"x103","board at that moment, Passepartout would have joined issue with him on"
"x103","a quite different subject, and in an entirely different manner."
"x103",""
"x103","Where was Fix at that moment?"
"x103",""
"x103","He was actually on board the General Grant."
"x103",""
"x103","On reaching Yokohama, the detective, leaving Mr. Fogg, whom he expected"
"x103","to meet again during the day, had repaired at once to the English"
"x103","consulate, where he at last found the warrant of arrest.  It had"
"x103","followed him from Bombay, and had come by the Carnatic, on which"
"x103","steamer he himself was supposed to be.  Fix's disappointment may be"
"x103","imagined when he reflected that the warrant was now useless.  Mr. Fogg"
"x103","had left English ground, and it was now necessary to procure his"
"x103","extradition!"
"x103",""
"x103","""Well,"" thought Fix, after a moment of anger, ""my warrant is not good"
"x103","here, but it will be in England.  The rogue evidently intends to return"
"x103","to his own country, thinking he has thrown the police off his track."
"x103","Good!  I will follow him across the Atlantic.  As for the money, heaven"
"x103","grant there may be some left!  But the fellow has already spent in"
"x103","travelling, rewards, trials, bail, elephants, and all sorts of charges,"
"x103","more than five thousand pounds.  Yet, after all, the Bank is rich!"""
"x103",""
"x103","His course decided on, he went on board the General Grant, and was"
"x103","there when Mr. Fogg and Aouda arrived.  To his utter amazement, he"
"x103","recognised Passepartout, despite his theatrical disguise.  He quickly"
"x103","concealed himself in his cabin, to avoid an awkward explanation, and"
"x103","hoped--thanks to the number of passengers--to remain unperceived by Mr."
"x103","Fogg's servant."
"x103",""
"x103","On that very day, however, he met Passepartout face to face on the"
"x103","forward deck.  The latter, without a word, made a rush for him, grasped"
"x103","him by the throat, and, much to the amusement of a group of Americans,"
"x103","who immediately began to bet on him, administered to the detective a"
"x103","perfect volley of blows, which proved the great superiority of French"
"x103","over English pugilistic skill."
"x103",""
"x103","When Passepartout had finished, he found himself relieved and"
"x103","comforted.  Fix got up in a somewhat rumpled condition, and, looking at"
"x103","his adversary, coldly said, ""Have you done?"""

"x103","""For this time--yes."""
"x103",""
"x103","""Then let me have a word with you."""
"x103",""
"x103","""But I--"""
"x103",""
"x103","""In your master's interests."""
"x103",""
"x103","Passepartout seemed to be vanquished by Fix's coolness, for he quietly"
"x103","followed him, and they sat down aside from the rest of the passengers."
"x103",""
"x103","""You have given me a thrashing,"" said Fix.  ""Good, I expected it.  Now,"
"x103","listen to me.  Up to this time I have been Mr. Fogg's adversary.  I am"
"x103","now in his game."""
"x103",""
"x103","""Aha!"" cried Passepartout; ""you are convinced he is an honest man?"""
"x103",""
"x103","""No,"" replied Fix coldly, ""I think him a rascal.  Sh! don't budge, and"
"x103","let me speak.  As long as Mr. Fogg was on English ground, it was for my"
"x103","interest to detain him there until my warrant of arrest arrived.  I did"
"x103","everything I could to keep him back.  I sent the Bombay priests after"
"x103","him, I got you intoxicated at Hong Kong, I separated you from him, and"
"x103","I made him miss the Yokohama steamer."""
"x103",""
"x103","Passepartout listened, with closed fists."
"x103",""
"x103","""Now,"" resumed Fix, ""Mr. Fogg seems to be going back to England.  Well,"
"x103","I will follow him there.  But hereafter I will do as much to keep"
"x103","obstacles out of his way as I have done up to this time to put them in"
"x103","his path.  I've changed my game, you see, and simply because it was for"
"x103","my interest to change it.  Your interest is the same as mine; for it is"
"x103","only in England that you will ascertain whether you are in the service"
"x103","of a criminal or an honest man."""
"x103",""
"x103","Passepartout listened very attentively to Fix, and was convinced that"
"x103","he spoke with entire good faith."
"x103",""
"x103","""Are we friends?"" asked the detective."
"x103",""

"x103","It was seven in the morning when Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Passepartout set"
"x103","foot upon the American continent, if this name can be given to the"
"x103","floating quay upon which they disembarked.  These quays, rising and"
"x103","falling with the tide, thus facilitate the loading and unloading of"
"x103","vessels.  Alongside them were clippers of all sizes, steamers of all"
"x103","nationalities, and the steamboats, with several decks rising one above"
"x103","the other, which ply on the Sacramento and its tributaries.  There were"
"x103","also heaped up the products of a commerce which extends to Mexico,"
"x103","Chili, Peru, Brazil, Europe, Asia, and all the Pacific islands."
"x103",""
"x103","Passepartout, in his joy on reaching at last the American continent,"
"x103","thought he would manifest it by executing a perilous vault in fine"
"x103","style; but, tumbling upon some worm-eaten planks, he fell through them."
"x103","Put out of countenance by the manner in which he thus ""set foot"" upon"
"x103","the New World, he uttered a loud cry, which so frightened the"
"x103","innumerable cormorants and pelicans that are always perched upon these"
"x103","movable quays, that they flew noisily away."
"x103",""
"x103","Mr. Fogg, on reaching shore, proceeded to find out at what hour the"
"x103","first train left for New York, and learned that this was at six o'clock"
"x103","p.m.; he had, therefore, an entire day to spend in the Californian"
"x103","capital.  Taking a carriage at a charge of three dollars, he and Aouda"
"x103","entered it, while Passepartout mounted the box beside the driver, and"
"x103","they set out for the International Hotel."

"x103","From his exalted position Passepartout observed with much curiosity the"

"x103","churches, the great docks, the palatial wooden and brick warehouses,"
"x103","the numerous conveyances, omnibuses, horse-cars, and upon the"
"x103","side-walks, not only Americans and Europeans, but Chinese and Indians."
"x103","Passepartout was surprised at all he saw.  San Francisco was no longer"
"x103","the legendary city of 1849--a city of banditti, assassins, and"
"x103","incendiaries, who had flocked hither in crowds in pursuit of plunder; a"
"x103","paradise of outlaws, where they gambled with gold-dust, a revolver in"
"x103","one hand and a bowie-knife in the other: it was now a great commercial"
"x103","emporium."

"x103","The lofty tower of its City Hall overlooked the whole panorama of the"
"x103","streets and avenues, which cut each other at right-angles, and in the"
"x103","midst of which appeared pleasant, verdant squares, while beyond"
"x103","appeared the Chinese quarter, seemingly imported from the Celestial"
"x103","Empire in a toy-box.  Sombreros and red shirts and plumed Indians were"
"x103","rarely to be seen; but there were silk hats and black coats everywhere"
"x103","worn by a multitude of nervously active, gentlemanly-looking men.  Some"
"x103","of the streets--especially Montgomery Street, which is to San Francisco"
"x103","what Regent Street is to London, the Boulevard des Italiens to Paris,"
"x103","and Broadway to New York--were lined with splendid and spacious"

"x103","beef, oyster soup, biscuits, and cheese, without taking out their"
"x103","purses.  Payment was made only for the ale, porter, or sherry which was"
"x103","drunk.  This seemed ""very American"" to Passepartout.  The hotel"
"x103","refreshment-rooms were comfortable, and Mr. Fogg and Aouda, installing"
"x103","themselves at a table, were abundantly served on diminutive plates by"
"x103","negroes of darkest hue."

"x103","After breakfast, Mr. Fogg, accompanied by Aouda, started for the"

"x103","New York and San Francisco are thus united by an uninterrupted metal"

"x103","1845, began to colonise."

"x103","It was in 1862 that, in spite of the Southern Members of Congress, who"
"x103","wished a more southerly route, it was decided to lay the road between"
"x103","the forty-first and forty-second parallels.  President Lincoln himself"
"x103","fixed the end of the line at Omaha, in Nebraska.  The work was at once"
"x103","commenced, and pursued with true American energy; nor did the rapidity"
"x103","with which it went on injuriously affect its good execution.  The road"
"x103","grew, on the prairies, a mile and a half a day.  A locomotive, running"

"x103","There was but little conversation in the car, and soon many of the"

"x103","the detective; but he did not talk to him.  After recent events, their"
"x103","relations with each other had grown somewhat cold; there could no"

"x103","approaching the mountain-sides, now suspended over precipices, avoiding"

"x103","seemed to have no outlet.  The locomotive, its great funnel emitting a"
"x103","weird light, with its sharp bell, and its cow-catcher extended like a"
"x103","spur, mingled its shrieks and bellowings with the noise of torrents and"
"x103","cascades, and twined its smoke among the branches of the gigantic pines."

"x103","There were few or no bridges or tunnels on the route.  The railway"
"x103","turned around the sides of the mountains, and did not attempt to"
"x103","violate nature by taking the shortest cut from one point to another."

"x103","The train entered the State of Nevada through the Carson Valley about"
"x103","nine o'clock, going always northeasterly; and at midday reached Reno,"
"x103","where there was a delay of twenty minutes for breakfast."

"x103","From this point the road, running along Humboldt River, passed"
"x103","northward for several miles by its banks; then it turned eastward, and"

"x103","extreme eastern limit of Nevada."

"x103","Having breakfasted, Mr. Fogg and his companions resumed their places in"
"x103","the car, and observed the varied landscape which unfolded itself as"
"x103","they passed along the vast prairies, the mountains lining the horizon,"
"x103","and the creeks, with their frothy, foaming streams.  Sometimes a great"
"x103","herd of buffaloes, massing together in the distance, seemed like a"
"x103","moveable dam.  These innumerable multitudes of ruminating beasts often"
"x103","form an insurmountable obstacle to the passage of the trains; thousands"
"x103","of them have been seen passing over the track for hours together, in"
"x103","compact ranks.  The locomotive is then forced to stop and wait till the"
"x103","road is once more clear."
"x103",""
"x103","This happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling."
"x103","About twelve o'clock a troop of ten or twelve thousand head of buffalo"
"x103","encumbered the track.  The locomotive, slackening its speed, tried to"
"x103","clear the way with its cow-catcher; but the mass of animals was too"
"x103","great.  The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil gait, uttering now"
"x103","and then deafening bellowings.  There was no use of interrupting them,"
"x103","for, having taken a particular direction, nothing can moderate and"
"x103","change their course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could"
"x103","contain."
"x103",""
"x103","The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but"
"x103","Phileas Fogg, who had the most reason of all to be in a hurry, remained"
"x103","in his seat, and waited philosophically until it should please the"
"x103","buffaloes to get out of the way."
"x103",""
"x103","Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed to"
"x103","discharge his arsenal of revolvers upon them."
"x103",""
"x103","""What a country!"" cried he.  ""Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in"
"x103","a procession, just as if they were not impeding travel!  Parbleu!  I"
"x103","should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his programme!"
"x103","And here's an engineer who doesn't dare to run the locomotive into this"
"x103","herd of beasts!"""
"x103",""
"x103","The engineer did not try to overcome the obstacle, and he was wise.  He"
"x103","would have crushed the first buffaloes, no doubt, with the cow-catcher;"
"x103","but the locomotive, however powerful, would soon have been checked, the"
"x103","train would inevitably have been thrown off the track, and would then"
"x103","have been helpless."
"x103",""
"x103","The best course was to wait patiently, and regain the lost time by"
"x103","greater speed when the obstacle was removed.  The procession of"
"x103","buffaloes lasted three full hours, and it was night before the track"
"x103","was clear.  The last ranks of the herd were now passing over the rails,"

"x103","Passepartout, about nine o'clock, went out upon the platform to take"

"x103","of gold, and Passepartout was amusing himself by calculating its value"
"x103","in pounds sterling, when he was diverted from this interesting study by"
"x103","a strange-looking personage who made his appearance on the platform."

"x103","This personage, who had taken the train at Elko, was tall and dark,"

"x103","written in manuscript."

"x103","Passepartout approached and read one of these notices, which stated"
"x103","that Elder William Hitch, Mormon missionary, taking advantage of his"
"x103","presence on train No. 48, would deliver a lecture on Mormonism in car"
"x103","No. 117, from eleven to twelve o'clock; and that he invited all who"
"x103","were desirous of being instructed concerning the mysteries of the"
"x103","religion of the ""Latter Day Saints"" to attend."
"x103",""
"x103","""I'll go,"" said Passepartout to himself.  He knew nothing of Mormonism"
"x103","except the custom of polygamy, which is its foundation."

"x103","The news quickly spread through the train, which contained about one"
"x103","hundred passengers, thirty of whom, at most, attracted by the notice,"
"x103","ensconced themselves in car No. 117.  Passepartout took one of the"
"x103","front seats.  Neither Mr. Fogg nor Fix cared to attend."
"x103",""
"x103","At the appointed hour Elder William Hitch rose, and, in an irritated"
"x103","voice, as if he had already been contradicted, said, ""I tell you that"
"x103","Joe Smith is a martyr, that his brother Hiram is a martyr, and that the"
"x103","persecutions of the United States Government against the prophets will"
"x103","also make a martyr of Brigham Young.  Who dares to say the contrary?"""
"x103",""
"x103","No one ventured to gainsay the missionary, whose excited tone"
"x103","contrasted curiously with his naturally calm visage.  No doubt his"
"x103","anger arose from the hardships to which the Mormons were actually"
"x103","subjected.  The government had just succeeded, with some difficulty, in"
"x103","reducing these independent fanatics to its rule.  It had made itself"
"x103","master of Utah, and subjected that territory to the laws of the Union,"
"x103","after imprisoning Brigham Young on a charge of rebellion and polygamy."
"x103","The disciples of the prophet had since redoubled their efforts, and"
"x103","resisted, by words at least, the authority of Congress.  Elder Hitch,"
"x103","as is seen, was trying to make proselytes on the very railway trains."
"x103",""
"x103","Then, emphasising his words with his loud voice and frequent gestures,"
"x103","he related the history of the Mormons from Biblical times: how that, in"
"x103","Israel, a Mormon prophet of the tribe of Joseph published the annals of"
"x103","the new religion, and bequeathed them to his son Mormon; how, many"
"x103","centuries later, a translation of this precious book, which was written"
"x103","in Egyptian, was made by Joseph Smith, junior, a Vermont farmer, who"
"x103","revealed himself as a mystical prophet in 1825; and how, in short, the"
"x103","celestial messenger appeared to him in an illuminated forest, and gave"
"x103","him the annals of the Lord."
"x103",""
"x103","Several of the audience, not being much interested in the missionary's"
"x103","narrative, here left the car; but Elder Hitch, continuing his lecture,"
"x103","related how Smith, junior, with his father, two brothers, and a few"
"x103","disciples, founded the church of the ""Latter Day Saints,"" which,"
"x103","adopted not only in America, but in England, Norway and Sweden, and"
"x103","Germany, counts many artisans, as well as men engaged in the liberal"
"x103","professions, among its members; how a colony was established in Ohio, a"
"x103","temple erected there at a cost of two hundred thousand dollars, and a"
"x103","town built at Kirkland; how Smith became an enterprising banker, and"
"x103","received from a simple mummy showman a papyrus scroll written by"
"x103","Abraham and several famous Egyptians."
"x103",""
"x103","The Elder's story became somewhat wearisome, and his audience grew"
"x103","gradually less, until it was reduced to twenty passengers.  But this"
"x103","did not disconcert the enthusiast, who proceeded with the story of"
"x103","Joseph Smith's bankruptcy in 1837, and how his ruined creditors gave"
"x103","him a coat of tar and feathers; his reappearance some years afterwards,"
"x103","more honourable and honoured than ever, at Independence, Missouri, the"
"x103","chief of a flourishing colony of three thousand disciples, and his"
"x103","pursuit thence by outraged Gentiles, and retirement into the Far West."
"x103",""
"x103","Ten hearers only were now left, among them honest Passepartout, who was"
"x103","listening with all his ears.  Thus he learned that, after long"
"x103","persecutions, Smith reappeared in Illinois, and in 1839 founded a"
"x103","community at Nauvoo, on the Mississippi, numbering twenty-five thousand"
"x103","souls, of which he became mayor, chief justice, and general-in-chief;"
"x103","that he announced himself, in 1843, as a candidate for the Presidency"

"x103","successor, left Nauvoo for the banks of the Great Salt Lake, where, in"
"x103","the midst of that fertile region, directly on the route of the"
"x103","emigrants who crossed Utah on their way to California, the new colony,"
"x103","thanks to the polygamy practised by the Mormons, had flourished beyond"
"x103","expectations."
"x103",""
"x103","""And this,"" added Elder William Hitch, ""this is why the jealousy of"
"x103","Congress has been aroused against us!  Why have the soldiers of the"

"x103","imprisoned, in contempt of all justice?  Shall we yield to force?"
"x103","Never!  Driven from Vermont, driven from Illinois, driven from Ohio,"
"x103","driven from Missouri, driven from Utah, we shall yet find some"
"x103","independent territory on which to plant our tents.  And you, my"

"x103","During the lecture the train had been making good progress, and towards"

"x103","an American Jordan.  It is a picturesque expanse, framed in lofty crags"
"x103","in large strata, encrusted with white salt--a superb sheet of water,"
"x103","which was formerly of larger extent than now, its shores having"
"x103","encroached with the lapse of time, and thus at once reduced its breadth"
"x103","and increased its depth."

"x103","The Salt Lake, seventy miles long and thirty-five wide, is situated"
"x103","three miles eight hundred feet above the sea.  Quite different from"

"x103","it contains considerable salt, and one quarter of the weight of its"
"x103","water is solid matter, its specific weight being 1,170, and, after"
"x103","being distilled, 1,000.  Fishes are, of course, unable to live in it,"
"x103","and those which descend through the Jordan, the Weber, and other"
"x103","streams soon perish."

"x103","The country around the lake was well cultivated, for the Mormons are"
"x103","mostly farmers; while ranches and pens for domesticated animals, fields"
"x103","of wheat, corn, and other cereals, luxuriant prairies, hedges of wild"

"x103","strikingly American town, built on the pattern of other cities of the"

"x103","mansion, the court-house, and the arsenal, blue-brick houses with"
"x103","verandas and porches, surrounded by gardens bordered with acacias,"

"x103","populated.  The streets were almost deserted, except in the vicinity of"

"x103","easily accounted for by the ""peculiar institution"" of the Mormons; but"
"x103","it must not be supposed that all the Mormons are polygamists.  They are"
"x103","free to marry or not, as they please; but it is worth noting that it is"
"x103","mainly the female citizens of Utah who are anxious to marry, as,"
"x103","according to the Mormon religion, maiden ladies are not admitted to the"
"x103","possession of its highest joys.  These poor creatures seemed to be"
"x103","neither well off nor happy.  Some--the more well-to-do, no doubt--wore"
"x103","short, open, black silk dresses, under a hood or modest shawl; others"
"x103","were habited in Indian fashion."

"x103","Passepartout could not behold without a certain fright these women,"
"x103","charged, in groups, with conferring happiness on a single Mormon.  His"
"x103","common sense pitied, above all, the husband.  It seemed to him a"
"x103","terrible thing to have to guide so many wives at once across the"
"x103","vicissitudes of life, and to conduct them, as it were, in a body to the"
"x103","Mormon paradise with the prospect of seeing them in the company of the"
"x103","glorious Smith, who doubtless was the chief ornament of that delightful"
"x103","place, to all eternity.  He felt decidedly repelled from such a"
"x103","vocation, and he imagined--perhaps he was mistaken--that the fair ones"
"x103","of Salt Lake City cast rather alarming glances on his person.  Happily,"
"x103","his stay there was but brief.  At four the party found themselves again"
"x103","at the station, took their places in the train, and the whistle sounded"
"x103","for starting.  Just at the moment, however, that the locomotive wheels"
"x103","began to move, cries of ""Stop! stop!"" were heard."
"x103",""
"x103","Trains, like time and tide, stop for no one.  The gentleman who uttered"
"x103","the cries was evidently a belated Mormon.  He was breathless with"
"x103","running.  Happily for him, the station had neither gates nor barriers."
"x103","He rushed along the track, jumped on the rear platform of the train,"
"x103","and fell, exhausted, into one of the seats."

"x103","Passepartout, who had been anxiously watching this amateur gymnast,"
"x103","approached him with lively interest, and learned that he had taken"
"x103","flight after an unpleasant domestic scene."

"x103","When the Mormon had recovered his breath, Passepartout ventured to ask"
"x103","him politely how many wives he had; for, from the manner in which he"

"x103","The train, on leaving Great Salt Lake at Ogden, passed northward for an"
"x103","hour as far as Weber River, having completed nearly nine hundred miles"
"x103","from San Francisco.  From this point it took an easterly direction"
"x103","towards the jagged Wahsatch Mountains.  It was in the section included"
"x103","between this range and the Rocky Mountains that the American engineers"
"x103","found the most formidable difficulties in laying the road, and that the"
"x103","government granted a subsidy of forty-eight thousand dollars per mile,"
"x103","instead of sixteen thousand allowed for the work done on the plains."
"x103","But the engineers, instead of violating nature, avoided its"
"x103","difficulties by winding around, instead of penetrating the rocks.  One"
"x103","tunnel only, fourteen thousand feet in length, was pierced in order to"
"x103","arrive at the great basin."
"x103",""
"x103","The track up to this time had reached its highest elevation at the"
"x103","Great Salt Lake.  From this point it described a long curve, descending"
"x103","towards Bitter Creek Valley, to rise again to the dividing ridge of the"
"x103","waters between the Atlantic and the Pacific.  There were many creeks in"
"x103","this mountainous region, and it was necessary to cross Muddy Creek,"
"x103","Green Creek, and others, upon culverts."
"x103",""
"x103","Passepartout grew more and more impatient as they went on, while Fix"
"x103","longed to get out of this difficult region, and was more anxious than"
"x103","Phileas Fogg himself to be beyond the danger of delays and accidents,"
"x103","and set foot on English soil."
"x103",""
"x103","At ten o'clock at night the train stopped at Fort Bridger station, and"
"x103","twenty minutes later entered Wyoming Territory, following the valley of"
"x103","Bitter Creek throughout.  The next day, 7th December, they stopped for"
"x103","a quarter of an hour at Green River station.  Snow had fallen"
"x103","abundantly during the night, but, being mixed with rain, it had half"
"x103","melted, and did not interrupt their progress.  The bad weather,"
"x103","however, annoyed Passepartout; for the accumulation of snow, by"
"x103","blocking the wheels of the cars, would certainly have been fatal to Mr."
"x103","Fogg's tour."

"x103","back from the window, feeling much alarm at her discovery.  She was"
"x103","attached to the man who, however coldly, gave her daily evidences of"

"x103","of the sentiment with which her protector inspired her, which she"
"x103","called gratitude, but which, though she was unconscious of it, was"
"x103","really more than that.  Her heart sank within her when she recognised"
"x103","the man whom Mr. Fogg desired, sooner or later, to call to account for"

"x103","On the declivity of the Atlantic basin the first streams, branches of"

"x103","Aouda behaved courageously from the first.  She defended herself like a"

"x103","fort was anxious, though he tried to conceal his apprehensions.  As"
"x103","night approached, the snow fell less plentifully, but it became"
"x103","intensely cold.  Absolute silence rested on the plains.  Neither flight"
"x103","of bird nor passing of beast troubled the perfect calm."
"x103",""
"x103","Throughout the night Aouda, full of sad forebodings, her heart stifled"
"x103","with anguish, wandered about on the verge of the plains.  Her"

"x103","Thus the night passed.  At dawn, the half-extinguished disc of the sun"

"x103","in the south all was still vacancy.  It was then seven o'clock."
"x103",""
"x103","The captain, who was really alarmed, did not know what course to take."
"x103",""
"x103","Should he send another detachment to the rescue of the first?  Should"
"x103","he sacrifice more men, with so few chances of saving those already"
"x103","sacrificed?  His hesitation did not last long, however.  Calling one of"
"x103","his lieutenants, he was on the point of ordering a reconnaissance, when"
"x103","gunshots were heard.  Was it a signal?  The soldiers rushed out of the"
"x103","fort, and half a mile off they perceived a little band returning in"
"x103","good order."
"x103",""
"x103","Mr. Fogg was marching at their head, and just behind him were"
"x103","Passepartout and the other two travellers, rescued from the Sioux."
"x103",""
"x103","They had met and fought the Indians ten miles south of Fort Kearney."
"x103","Shortly before the detachment arrived, Passepartout and his companions"
"x103","had begun to struggle with their captors, three of whom the Frenchman"
"x103","had felled with his fists, when his master and the soldiers hastened up"
"x103","to their relief."
"x103",""
"x103","All were welcomed with joyful cries.  Phileas Fogg distributed the"

"x103","Fix, without saying a word, looked at Mr. Fogg, and it would have been"
"x103","difficult to analyse the thoughts which struggled within him.  As for"
"x103","Aouda, she took her protector's hand and pressed it in her own, too"
"x103","much moved to speak."
"x103",""
"x103","Meanwhile, Passepartout was looking about for the train; he thought he"

"x103",""
"x103","It was the man who had spoken to Fix during the night, and whose offer"
"x103","he had refused."

"x103","Phileas Fogg did not reply at once; but Fix, having pointed out the"
"x103","man, who was walking up and down in front of the station, Mr. Fogg went"
"x103","up to him.  An instant after, Mr. Fogg and the American, whose name was"
"x103","Mudge, entered a hut built just below the fort."
"x103",""
"x103","There Mr. Fogg examined a curious vehicle, a kind of frame on two long"
"x103","beams, a little raised in front like the runners of a sledge, and upon"
"x103","which there was room for five or six persons.  A high mast was fixed on"
"x103","the frame, held firmly by metallic lashings, to which was attached a"
"x103","large brigantine sail.  This mast held an iron stay upon which to hoist"
"x103","a jib-sail.  Behind, a sort of rudder served to guide the vehicle.  It"
"x103","was, in short, a sledge rigged like a sloop.  During the winter, when"
"x103","the trains are blocked up by the snow, these sledges make extremely"
"x103","rapid journeys across the frozen plains from one station to another."
"x103","Provided with more sails than a cutter, and with the wind behind them,"
"x103","they slip over the surface of the prairies with a speed equal if not"
"x103","superior to that of the express trains."
"x103",""
"x103","Mr. Fogg readily made a bargain with the owner of this land-craft.  The"
"x103","wind was favourable, being fresh, and blowing from the west.  The snow"
"x103","had hardened, and Mudge was very confident of being able to transport"
"x103","Mr. Fogg in a few hours to Omaha.  Thence the trains eastward run"
"x103","frequently to Chicago and New York.  It was not impossible that the"
"x103","lost time might yet be recovered; and such an opportunity was not to be"
"x103","rejected."
"x103",""
"x103","Not wishing to expose Aouda to the discomforts of travelling in the"
"x103","open air, Mr. Fogg proposed to leave her with Passepartout at Fort"
"x103","Kearney, the servant taking upon himself to escort her to Europe by a"
"x103","better route and under more favourable conditions.  But Aouda refused"
"x103","to separate from Mr. Fogg, and Passepartout was delighted with her"
"x103","decision; for nothing could induce him to leave his master while Fix"
"x103","was with him."
"x103",""
"x103","It would be difficult to guess the detective's thoughts.  Was this"
"x103","conviction shaken by Phileas Fogg's return, or did he still regard him"
"x103","as an exceedingly shrewd rascal, who, his journey round the world"
"x103","completed, would think himself absolutely safe in England?  Perhaps"
"x103","Fix's opinion of Phileas Fogg was somewhat modified; but he was"

"x103","At eight o'clock the sledge was ready to start.  The passengers took"
"x103","their places on it, and wrapped themselves up closely in their"
"x103","travelling-cloaks.  The two great sails were hoisted, and under the"
"x103","pressure of the wind the sledge slid over the hardened snow with a"
"x103","velocity of forty miles an hour."
"x103",""
"x103","The distance between Fort Kearney and Omaha, as the birds fly, is at"
"x103","most two hundred miles.  If the wind held good, the distance might be"
"x103","traversed in five hours; if no accident happened the sledge might reach"
"x103","Omaha by one o'clock."
"x103",""
"x103","What a journey!  The travellers, huddled close together, could not"
"x103","speak for the cold, intensified by the rapidity at which they were"
"x103","going.  The sledge sped on as lightly as a boat over the waves.  When"
"x103","the breeze came skimming the earth the sledge seemed to be lifted off"
"x103","the ground by its sails.  Mudge, who was at the rudder, kept in a"
"x103","straight line, and by a turn of his hand checked the lurches which the"
"x103","vehicle had a tendency to make.  All the sails were up, and the jib was"
"x103","so arranged as not to screen the brigantine.  A top-mast was hoisted,"
"x103","and another jib, held out to the wind, added its force to the other"
"x103","sails.  Although the speed could not be exactly estimated, the sledge"
"x103","could not be going at less than forty miles an hour."

"x103","The prairie, across which the sledge was moving in a straight line, was"
"x103","as flat as a sea.  It seemed like a vast frozen lake.  The railroad"
"x103","which ran through this section ascended from the south-west to the"
"x103","north-west by Great Island, Columbus, an important Nebraska town,"
"x103","Schuyler, and Fremont, to Omaha.  It followed throughout the right bank"
"x103","of the Platte River.  The sledge, shortening this route, took a chord"
"x103","of the arc described by the railway.  Mudge was not afraid of being"
"x103","stopped by the Platte River, because it was frozen.  The road, then,"
"x103","was quite clear of obstacles, and Phileas Fogg had but two things to"
"x103","fear--an accident to the sledge, and a change or calm in the wind."
"x103",""
"x103","But the breeze, far from lessening its force, blew as if to bend the"
"x103","mast, which, however, the metallic lashings held firmly.  These"
"x103","lashings, like the chords of a stringed instrument, resounded as if"
"x103","vibrated by a violin bow.  The sledge slid along in the midst of a"
"x103","plaintively intense melody."
"x103",""
"x103","""Those chords give the fifth and the octave,"" said Mr. Fogg."
"x103",""
"x103","These were the only words he uttered during the journey.  Aouda, cosily"
"x103","packed in furs and cloaks, was sheltered as much as possible from the"
"x103","attacks of the freezing wind.  As for Passepartout, his face was as red"
"x103","as the sun's disc when it sets in the mist, and he laboriously inhaled"
"x103","the biting air.  With his natural buoyancy of spirits, he began to hope"
"x103","again.  They would reach New York on the evening, if not on the"
"x103","morning, of the 11th, and there was still some chances that it would be"
"x103","before the steamer sailed for Liverpool."
"x103",""
"x103","Passepartout even felt a strong desire to grasp his ally, Fix, by the"
"x103","hand.  He remembered that it was the detective who procured the sledge,"
"x103","the only means of reaching Omaha in time; but, checked by some"
"x103","presentiment, he kept his usual reserve.  One thing, however,"
"x103","Passepartout would never forget, and that was the sacrifice which Mr."
"x103","Fogg had made, without hesitation, to rescue him from the Sioux.  Mr."
"x103","Fogg had risked his fortune and his life. No!  His servant would never"
"x103","forget that!"

"x103","While each of the party was absorbed in reflections so different, the"
"x103","sledge flew past over the vast carpet of snow.  The creeks it passed"
"x103","over were not perceived.  Fields and streams disappeared under the"
"x103","uniform whiteness.  The plain was absolutely deserted.  Between the"
"x103","Union Pacific road and the branch which unites Kearney with Saint"
"x103","Joseph it formed a great uninhabited island.  Neither village, station,"
"x103","nor fort appeared.  From time to time they sped by some phantom-like"
"x103","tree, whose white skeleton twisted and rattled in the wind.  Sometimes"
"x103","flocks of wild birds rose, or bands of gaunt, famished, ferocious"
"x103","prairie-wolves ran howling after the sledge.  Passepartout, revolver in"
"x103","hand, held himself ready to fire on those which came too near.  Had an"
"x103","accident then happened to the sledge, the travellers, attacked by these"
"x103","beasts, would have been in the most terrible danger; but it held on its"
"x103","even course, soon gained on the wolves, and ere long left the howling"
"x103","band at a safe distance behind."

"x103","About noon Mudge perceived by certain landmarks that he was crossing"
"x103","the Platte River.  He said nothing, but he felt certain that he was now"
"x103","within twenty miles of Omaha.  In less than an hour he left the rudder"

"x103","As for Fix, he said to himself that the Bank of England would certainly"
"x103","not come out of this affair well indemnified.  When they reached"

"x103",""
"x103","IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG SHOWS HIMSELF EQUAL TO THE OCCASION"
"x103",""
"x103",""
"x103","An hour after, the Henrietta passed the lighthouse which marks the"
"x103","entrance of the Hudson, turned the point of Sandy Hook, and put to sea."
"x103","During the day she skirted Long Island, passed Fire Island, and"
"x103","directed her course rapidly eastward."
"x103",""
"x103","At noon the next day, a man mounted the bridge to ascertain the"
"x103","vessel's position.  It might be thought that this was Captain Speedy."
"x103","Not the least in the world.  It was Phileas Fogg, Esquire.  As for"
"x103","Captain Speedy, he was shut up in his cabin under lock and key, and was"
"x103","uttering loud cries, which signified an anger at once pardonable and"
"x103","excessive."
"x103",""
"x103","What had happened was very simple.  Phileas Fogg wished to go to"
"x103","Liverpool, but the captain would not carry him there.  Then Phileas"
"x103","Fogg had taken passage for Bordeaux, and, during the thirty hours he"
"x103","had been on board, had so shrewdly managed with his banknotes that the"
"x103","sailors and stokers, who were only an occasional crew, and were not on"
"x103","the best terms with the captain, went over to him in a body.  This was"
"x103","why Phileas Fogg was in command instead of Captain Speedy; why the"
"x103","captain was a prisoner in his cabin; and why, in short, the Henrietta"
"x103","was directing her course towards Liverpool.  It was very clear, to see"
"x103","Mr. Fogg manage the craft, that he had been a sailor."
"x103",""
"x103","How the adventure ended will be seen anon.  Aouda was anxious, though"
"x103","she said nothing.  As for Passepartout, he thought Mr. Fogg's manoeuvre"
"x103","simply glorious.  The captain had said ""between eleven and twelve"
"x103","knots,"" and the Henrietta confirmed his prediction."
"x103",""
"x103","If, then--for there were ""ifs"" still--the sea did not become too"
"x103","boisterous, if the wind did not veer round to the east, if no accident"
"x103","happened to the boat or its machinery, the Henrietta might cross the"
"x103","three thousand miles from New York to Liverpool in the nine days,"
"x103","between the 12th and the 21st of December.  It is true that, once"
"x103","arrived, the affair on board the Henrietta, added to that of the Bank"
"x103","of England, might create more difficulties for Mr. Fogg than he"
"x103","imagined or could desire."
"x103",""
"x103","During the first days, they went along smoothly enough.  The sea was"
"x103","not very unpropitious, the wind seemed stationary in the north-east,"
"x103","the sails were hoisted, and the Henrietta ploughed across the waves"
"x103","like a real trans-Atlantic steamer."
"x103",""
"x103","Passepartout was delighted.  His master's last exploit, the"
"x103","consequences of which he ignored, enchanted him.  Never had the crew"
"x103","seen so jolly and dexterous a fellow.  He formed warm friendships with"
"x103","the sailors, and amazed them with his acrobatic feats.  He thought they"
"x103","managed the vessel like gentlemen, and that the stokers fired up like"
"x103","heroes.  His loquacious good-humour infected everyone.  He had"
"x103","forgotten the past, its vexations and delays.  He only thought of the"
"x103","end, so nearly accomplished; and sometimes he boiled over with"
"x103","impatience, as if heated by the furnaces of the Henrietta.  Often,"
"x103","also, the worthy fellow revolved around Fix, looking at him with a"
"x103","keen, distrustful eye; but he did not speak to him, for their old"
"x103","intimacy no longer existed."
"x103",""
"x103","Fix, it must be confessed, understood nothing of what was going on."
"x103","The conquest of the Henrietta, the bribery of the crew, Fogg managing"
"x103","the boat like a skilled seaman, amazed and confused him.  He did not"
"x103","know what to think.  For, after all, a man who began by stealing"
"x103","fifty-five thousand pounds might end by stealing a vessel; and Fix was"
"x103","not unnaturally inclined to conclude that the Henrietta under Fogg's"
"x103","command, was not going to Liverpool at all, but to some part of the"
"x103","world where the robber, turned into a pirate, would quietly put himself"
"x103","in safety.  The conjecture was at least a plausible one, and the"
"x103","detective began to seriously regret that he had embarked on the affair."
"x103",""
"x103","As for Captain Speedy, he continued to howl and growl in his cabin; and"
"x103","Passepartout, whose duty it was to carry him his meals, courageous as"
"x103","he was, took the greatest precautions.  Mr. Fogg did not seem even to"
"x103","know that there was a captain on board."
"x103",""
"x103","On the 13th they passed the edge of the Banks of Newfoundland, a"
"x103","dangerous locality; during the winter, especially, there are frequent"
"x103","fogs and heavy gales of wind.  Ever since the evening before the"
"x103","barometer, suddenly falling, had indicated an approaching change in the"
"x103","atmosphere; and during the night the temperature varied, the cold"
"x103","became sharper, and the wind veered to the south-east."
"x103",""
"x103","This was a misfortune.  Mr. Fogg, in order not to deviate from his"
"x103","course, furled his sails and increased the force of the steam; but the"
"x103","vessel's speed slackened, owing to the state of the sea, the long waves"
"x103","of which broke against the stern.  She pitched violently, and this"
"x103","retarded her progress.  The breeze little by little swelled into a"
"x103","tempest, and it was to be feared that the Henrietta might not be able"
"x103","to maintain herself upright on the waves."
"x103",""
"x103","Passepartout's visage darkened with the skies, and for two days the"
"x103","poor fellow experienced constant fright.  But Phileas Fogg was a bold"
"x103","mariner, and knew how to maintain headway against the sea; and he kept"
"x103","on his course, without even decreasing his steam.  The Henrietta, when"
"x103","she could not rise upon the waves, crossed them, swamping her deck, but"
"x103","passing safely.  Sometimes the screw rose out of the water, beating its"
"x103","protruding end, when a mountain of water raised the stern above the"
"x103","waves; but the craft always kept straight ahead."
"x103",""
"x103","The wind, however, did not grow as boisterous as might have been"
"x103","feared; it was not one of those tempests which burst, and rush on with"
"x103","a speed of ninety miles an hour.  It continued fresh, but, unhappily,"
"x103","it remained obstinately in the south-east, rendering the sails useless."
"x103",""
"x103","The 16th of December was the seventy-fifth day since Phileas Fogg's"
"x103","departure from London, and the Henrietta had not yet been seriously"
"x103","delayed.  Half of the voyage was almost accomplished, and the worst"
"x103","localities had been passed.  In summer, success would have been"
"x103","well-nigh certain.  In winter, they were at the mercy of the bad"
"x103","season.  Passepartout said nothing; but he cherished hope in secret,"
"x103","and comforted himself with the reflection that, if the wind failed"
"x103","them, they might still count on the steam."
"x103",""
"x103","On this day the engineer came on deck, went up to Mr. Fogg, and began"
"x103","to speak earnestly with him.  Without knowing why it was a"
"x103","presentiment, perhaps Passepartout became vaguely uneasy.  He would"
"x103","have given one of his ears to hear with the other what the engineer was"
"x103","saying.  He finally managed to catch a few words, and was sure he heard"
"x103","his master say, ""You are certain of what you tell me?"""
"x103",""
"x103","""Certain, sir,"" replied the engineer.  ""You must remember that, since"
"x103","we started, we have kept up hot fires in all our furnaces, and, though"
"x103","we had coal enough to go on short steam from New York to Bordeaux, we"
"x103","haven't enough to go with all steam from New York to Liverpool."" ""I"
"x103","will consider,"" replied Mr. Fogg."
"x103",""
"x103","Passepartout understood it all; he was seized with mortal anxiety.  The"
"x103","coal was giving out!  ""Ah, if my master can get over that,"" muttered"
"x103","he, ""he'll be a famous man!""  He could not help imparting to Fix what"
"x103","he had overheard."
"x103",""
"x103","""Then you believe that we really are going to Liverpool?"""
"x103",""
"x103","""Of course."""
"x103",""
"x103","""Ass!"" replied the detective, shrugging his shoulders and turning on"
"x103","his heel."
"x103",""
"x103","Passepartout was on the point of vigorously resenting the epithet, the"
"x103","reason of which he could not for the life of him comprehend; but he"
"x103","reflected that the unfortunate Fix was probably very much disappointed"
"x103","and humiliated in his self-esteem, after having so awkwardly followed a"
"x103","false scent around the world, and refrained."
"x103",""
"x103","And now what course would Phileas Fogg adopt?  It was difficult to"
"x103","imagine.  Nevertheless he seemed to have decided upon one, for that"
"x103","evening he sent for the engineer, and said to him, ""Feed all the fires"
"x103","until the coal is exhausted."""
"x103",""
"x103","A few moments after, the funnel of the Henrietta vomited forth torrents"
"x103","of smoke.  The vessel continued to proceed with all steam on; but on"
"x103","the 18th, the engineer, as he had predicted, announced that the coal"
"x103","would give out in the course of the day."
"x103",""
"x103","""Do not let the fires go down,"" replied Mr. Fogg.  ""Keep them up to the"
"x103","last.  Let the valves be filled."""
"x103",""
"x103","Towards noon Phileas Fogg, having ascertained their position, called"
"x103","Passepartout, and ordered him to go for Captain Speedy.  It was as if"
"x103","the honest fellow had been commanded to unchain a tiger.  He went to"
"x103","the poop, saying to himself, ""He will be like a madman!"""
"x103",""
"x103","In a few moments, with cries and oaths, a bomb appeared on the"
"x103","poop-deck.  The bomb was Captain Speedy.  It was clear that he was on"
"x103","the point of bursting.  ""Where are we?""  were the first words his anger"
"x103","permitted him to utter.  Had the poor man been an apoplectic, he could"
"x103","never have recovered from his paroxysm of wrath."
"x103",""
"x103","""Where are we?"" he repeated, with purple face."
"x103",""
"x103","""Seven hundred and seven miles from Liverpool,"" replied Mr. Fogg, with"

"x103",""
"x103","""Pirate!"" cried Captain Speedy."
"x103",""
"x103","""I have sent for you, sir--"""
"x103",""
"x103","""Pickaroon!"""
"x103",""
"x103","""--sir,"" continued Mr. Fogg, ""to ask you to sell me your vessel."""

"x103","""Burn the Henrietta!"""
"x103",""
"x103","""Yes; at least the upper part of her.  The coal has given out."""
"x103",""
"x103","""Burn my vessel!"" cried Captain Speedy, who could scarcely pronounce"
"x103","the words.  ""A vessel worth fifty thousand dollars!"""
"x103",""
"x103","""Here are sixty thousand,"" replied Phileas Fogg, handing the captain a"
"x103","roll of bank-bills.  This had a prodigious effect on Andrew Speedy.  An"
"x103","American can scarcely remain unmoved at the sight of sixty thousand"
"x103","dollars.  The captain forgot in an instant his anger, his imprisonment,"
"x103","and all his grudges against his passenger.  The Henrietta was twenty"
"x103","years old; it was a great bargain.  The bomb would not go off after"
"x103","all.  Mr. Fogg had taken away the match."
"x103",""
"x103","""And I shall still have the iron hull,"" said the captain in a softer"
"x103","tone."
"x103",""
"x103","""The iron hull and the engine.  Is it agreed?"""
"x103",""
"x103","""Agreed."""
"x103",""
"x103","And Andrew Speedy, seizing the banknotes, counted them and consigned"
"x103","them to his pocket."
"x103",""
"x103","During this colloquy, Passepartout was as white as a sheet, and Fix"
"x103","seemed on the point of having an apoplectic fit.  Nearly twenty"
"x103","thousand pounds had been expended, and Fogg left the hull and engine to"
"x103","the captain, that is, near the whole value of the craft!  It was true,"
"x103","however, that fifty-five thousand pounds had been stolen from the Bank."
"x103",""
"x103","When Andrew Speedy had pocketed the money, Mr. Fogg said to him, ""Don't"

"x103","""Captain Fogg, you've got something of the Yankee about you."""

"x103","twenty-four hours more in which to get to London; that length of time"

"x103","Queenstown is the Irish port at which the trans-Atlantic steamers stop"

"x103","Phileas Fogg had, without suspecting it, gained one day on his journey,"

"x103","In journeying eastward he had gone towards the sun, and the days"

"x103","degrees in this direction.  There are three hundred and sixty degrees"
"x103","on the circumference of the earth; and these three hundred and sixty"
"x103","degrees, multiplied by four minutes, gives precisely twenty-four"
"x103","hours--that is, the day unconsciously gained.  In other words, while"
"x103","Phileas Fogg, going eastward, saw the sun pass the meridian eighty"
"x103","times, his friends in London only saw it pass the meridian seventy-nine"
"x103","times.  This is why they awaited him at the Reform Club on Saturday,"

"x103","Phileas Fogg, then, had won the twenty thousand pounds; but, as he had"
"x103","spent nearly nineteen thousand on the way, the pecuniary gain was"
"x103","small.  His object was, however, to be victorious, and not to win"
"x103","money.  He divided the one thousand pounds that remained between"
"x103","Passepartout and the unfortunate Fix, against whom he cherished no"
"x103","grudge.  He deducted, however, from Passepartout's share the cost of"
"x103","the gas which had burned in his room for nineteen hundred and twenty"
"x103","hours, for the sake of regularity."

"x18857",""
"x18857","Looking back to all that has occurred to me since that eventful day, I"
"x18857","am scarcely able to believe in the reality of my adventures. They were"
"x18857","truly so wonderful that even now I am bewildered when I think of them."
"x18857",""
"x18857","My uncle was a German, having married my mother's sister, an"
"x18857","Englishwoman. Being very much attached to his fatherless nephew, he"
"x18857","invited me to study under him in his home in the fatherland. This home"
"x18857","was in a large town, and my uncle a professor of philosophy, chemistry,"
"x18857","geology, mineralogy, and many other ologies."
"x18857",""
"x18857","One day, after passing some hours in the laboratory--my uncle being"
"x18857","absent at the time--I suddenly felt the necessity of renovating the"
"x18857","tissues--<i>i.e.</i>, I was hungry, and was about to rouse up our old French"
"x18857","cook, when my uncle, Professor Von Hardwigg, suddenly opened the street"
"x18857","door, and came rushing upstairs."
"x18857",""
"x18857","Now Professor Hardwigg, my worthy uncle, is by no means a bad sort of"
"x18857","man; he is, however, choleric and original. To bear with him means to"
"x18857","obey; and scarcely had his heavy feet resounded within our joint"
"x18857","domicile than he shouted for me to attend upon him."
"x18857",""
"x18857","""Harry--Harry--Harry--"""
"x18857",""
"x18857","I hastened to obey, but before I could reach his room, jumping three"
"x18857","steps at a time, he was stamping his right foot upon the landing."
"x18857",""
"x18857","""Harry!"" he cried, in a frantic tone, ""are you coming up?"""
"x18857",""
"x18857","Now to tell the truth, at that moment I was far more interested in the"
"x18857","question as to what was to constitute our dinner than in any problem of"
"x18857","science; to me soup was more interesting than soda, an omelette more"
"x18857","tempting than arithmetic, and an artichoke of ten times more value than"
"x18857","any amount of asbestos."
"x18857",""
"x18857","But my uncle was not a man to be kept waiting; so adjourning therefore"
"x18857","all minor questions, I presented myself before him."
"x18857",""
"x18857","He was a very learned man. Now most persons in this category supply"
"x18857","themselves with information, as peddlers do with goods, for the benefit"
"x18857","of others, and lay up stores in order to diffuse them abroad for the"
"x18857","benefit of society in general. Not so my excellent uncle, Professor"
"x18857","Hardwigg; he studied, he consumed the midnight oil, he pored over heavy"
"x18857","tomes, and digested huge quartos and folios in order to keep the"
"x18857","knowledge acquired to himself."
"x18857",""
"x18857","There was a reason, and it may be regarded as a good one, why my uncle"
"x18857","objected to display his learning more than was absolutely necessary: he"
"x18857","stammered; and when intent upon explaining the phenomena of the heavens,"
"x18857","was apt to find himself at fault, and allude in such a vague way to sun,"
"x18857","moon, and stars that few were able to comprehend his meaning. To tell"
"x18857","the honest truth, when the right word would not come, it was generally"
"x18857","replaced by a very powerful adjective."
"x18857",""
"x18857","In connection with the sciences there are many almost unpronounceable"
"x18857","names--names very much resembling those of Welsh villages; and my uncle"
"x18857","being very fond of using them, his habit of stammering was not thereby"
"x18857","improved. In fact, there were periods in his discourse when he would"
"x18857","finally give up and swallow his discomfiture--in a glass of water."
"x18857",""
"x18857","As I said, my uncle, Professor Hardwigg, was a very learned man; and I"
"x18857","now add a most kind relative. I was bound to him by the double ties of"
"x18857","affection and interest. I took deep interest in all his doings, and"
"x18857","hoped some day to be almost as learned myself. It was a rare thing for"
"x18857","me to be absent from his lectures. Like him, I preferred mineralogy to"
"x18857","all the other sciences. My anxiety was to gain real <i>knowledge of the"
"x18857","earth</i>. Geology and mineralogy were to us the sole objects of life, and"
"x18857","in connection with these studies many a fair specimen of stone, chalk,"
"x18857","or metal did we break with our hammers."
"x18857",""
"x18857","Steel rods, loadstones, glass pipes, and bottles of various acids were"
"x18857","oftener before us than our meals. My uncle Hardwigg was once known to"
"x18857","classify six hundred different geological specimens by their weight,"
"x18857","hardness, fusibility, sound, taste, and smell."
"x18857",""
"x18857","He corresponded with all the great, learned, and scientific men of the"
"x18857","age. I was, therefore, in constant communication with, at all events the"
"x18857","letters of, Sir Humphry Davy, Captain Franklin, and other great men."
"x18857",""
"x18857","But before I state the subject on which my uncle wished to confer with"
"x18857","me, I must say a word about his personal appearance. Alas! my readers"
"x18857","will see a very different portrait of him at a future time, after he has"
"x18857","gone through the fearful adventures yet to be related."
"x18857",""
"x18857","My uncle was fifty years old; tall, thin, and wiry. Large spectacles"
"x18857","hid, to a certain extent, his vast, round, and goggle eyes, while his"
"x18857","nose was irreverently compared to a thin file. So much indeed did it"
"x18857","resemble that useful article, that a compass was said in his presence to"
"x18857","have made considerable N (Nasal) deviation."
"x18857",""
"x18857","The truth being told, however, the only article really attracted to my"
"x18857","uncle's nose was tobacco."
"x18857",""
"x18857","Another peculiarity of his was, that he always stepped a yard at a time,"
"x18857","clenched his fists as if he were going to hit you, and was, when in one"
"x18857","of his peculiar humors, very far from a pleasant companion."
"x18857",""
"x18857","It is further necessary to observe that he lived in a very nice house,"
"x18857","in that very nice street, the Konigstrasse at Hamburg. Though lying in"
"x18857","the centre of a town, it was perfectly rural in its aspect--half wood,"
"x18857","half bricks, with old-fashioned gables--one of the few old houses spared"
"x18857","by the great fire of 1842."
"x18857",""
"x18857","When I say a nice house, I mean a handsome house--old, tottering, and"
"x18857","not exactly comfortable to English notions: a house a little off the"
"x18857","perpendicular and inclined to fall into the neighboring canal; exactly"
"x18857","the house for a wandering artist to depict; all the more that you could"
"x18857","scarcely see it for ivy and a magnificent old tree which grew over the"
"x18857","door."
"x18857",""
"x18857","My uncle was rich; his house was his own property, while he had a"
"x18857","considerable private income. To my notion the best part of his"
"x18857","possessions was his god-daughter, Gretchen. And the old cook, the young"
"x18857","lady, the Professor and I were the sole inhabitants."
"x18857",""
"x18857","I loved mineralogy, I loved geology. To me there was nothing like"
"x18857","pebbles--and if my uncle had been in a little less of a fury, we should"
"x18857","have been the happiest of families. To prove the excellent Hardwigg's"
"x18857","impatience, I solemnly declare that when the flowers in the drawing-room"
"x18857","pots began to grow, he rose every morning at four o'clock to make them"
"x18857","grow quicker by pulling the leaves!"

"x18857","curiosity that can well be imagined--minerals, however, predominating."

"x18857","uncle, apparently oblivious of the fact that he had summoned me to his"
"x18857","presence, was absorbed in a book. He was particularly fond of early"
"x18857","editions, tall copies, and unique works."

"x18857","which it opened in his hand, and repeated aloud, half a dozen times,"
"x18857","that it was very, very old."
"x18857",""
"x18857","To my fancy he was making a great fuss about nothing, but it was not my"
"x18857","province to say so. On the contrary, I professed considerable interest"
